2,"Remember you can leave your 'thoughts' here about this news story, or react to other people's opinions. Personally, I am worried that because the rocket launch was a failure, North Korea will restart testing nuclear weapons next."
3,"I felt relived to hear the news that the rocket launch failed, but now I am worried,too. I can't speculate what North Korea plot to do next."
4,"Fortunately, this time,North Korea's long-launch rocket failed . But, it may success next time. It is too late that. Then, people who live around North Korea confront more fear than now. I argue that Japanese government should emphasize that North Korea must not test rocket launch and nuclear weapon again. If not , in near the future, North Korea's rocket or nuclear weapon took a heavy toll of human lives. **name** **name**"
5,"I think Japan should continue to impose economic sanctions on North Korea whether or not its missile test failed. Anyway,North Korea's missile test and nuclear testing can be great threat to the countries around it,including japan.We have to criticize North Korea for its provocative acts and send the messages to it through economic sanctions."
6,"I became worried when I first heard this news. The rocket launch failed, but that time Japanese government' response was not sufficient. I think that the Japanese government must prepare more in case rocket launch is successful."
7,"I am worried whether scientists concerned with this failure will be killed. As soon as Kim Jong-un get this state,he purged a high officer who had made a mistake.Therefore I think that he may purge the scientists too. **name** **name**"
8,"I felt worried and fear about this news. As my classmates said, Japanese government should keep more strict watch on North Korea's words and actions especially concerning nuclear. Because as we know, nuclear power can destroy everything. Also I claim Japanese people need to have a sense of crisis."
9,"The purpose of North Korea's rocket launch was to inspire the nation, but as a result, the failure emphasized lack of consideration and it made the nation disappointed. I'm afraid that the irritation caused by this failure will give rise to North Korea's more drastic actions."
10,"When I knew this news, I felt relived. However, at the same time, I felt fear. It is because I thought North Korea would test again. Japan is near North Korea. So Japan should be more careful than now, and it is important for Japan to cooperate with other countries. I hope peace will be brought on earth soon."
11,"This news made me sad. I agreed with ID1204 about Japanese government. They have a role of protecting Japanese. However, their react after failing of missile was terrible. They should learn how to protect our own country and people as a neighbor of North Korea. I thought this incident became a good opportunity of thinking about system of Japanese government."
12,"When I heard about the news, I was worried could Japan actually shoot down the rocket. This time, Japan took nearly 1 hour to confirm that North Korea had launched the rocket. I think Japan need extra strategy to protect Japan."
13,"Just like everyone else i felt relived too, and also anxious about what will North Korea do next. and also same as ID1204 and shiho0618, that i think we need to take another look at how Japanese government will correspond to the emergency."
14,"I'm disagree about ID1203's opinion because I think civilization society must think about north Korea people's human rights. In my opinion, china must cooperate with United Nations Security Council's resolution because obstacle in north Korea case is china will not agree with United Nations Security Council's resolution."
15,I felt relieved when I heard the news. It is not first time to hear the news about North Korea's rocket. I am worried that they will do something dangerous again. I think Japan should watch for them more carefully.
16,Is this a article for prepare the test on 4/23?
17,"I feel less safe after the rocket failed. North Korea will find out why the rocket failed and they will learn to launch a rocket successfully . Next time, they might do better so I don't feel safe."
18,"Yes, there will be three questions about the article in next week's quiz. Together they will be worth 30% of the final quiz score"
19,"North Korea I was reaffirmed that it is a very dangerous country by this time of missile launch.I do not know whether the missile is fired, I think, need to be more cautious because they may be fired missile to Japan time."
20,"I am relieved that there was no damage and victim. However, I think that North Korea fires the rocket again. Other countries should pay attention to North Korea more."
21,"When I heard the news for the first time,I didn't worry about it and I thought that everyone too made a fuss about it.However I heard that rocket debris crashed off Kunsan,I felt fear suddenly.i reconfirm North Korea is very dangerous,so the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family its government."
22,↑ the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family FROM its government
23,"North Korea is wasting its money.They should use the money for food to save its citizens, not for launching missiles. It is very dangerous that North Korea is still considering to continue on inventing weapons. Countries like America, Korea and Japan should keep on putting on pressure to North Korea, and should keep on working persuading North Korea to stop making weapons. In order to persuade North Korea, we need more help especially from China."
24,"I deeply regret that North Korea launched the rocket. This country spend much money on arms not on food for its people. Furthermore, the U.S. heard the launch and decided to stop the support of food. I worry about the life of North Korea's citizens. I strongly believe that North Korea should abolish dictatorship as soon as possible. I hope that North Korea gets the democratic government and society."
25,"First ,I was relieved that no one was injured in this rocket launch.But I have strong anxiety about the future of Japan and North Korea. The people of North Korea are under bad food condition. And Japan government is not ready for North Korea's military action. We must think about the future of East Asia and act for peace."
26,"Like most of the responses here, I felt relieved. Thinking about world peace, this act must not be allowed. Problems that North Korea has caused between the other countries are not only this, there are many others. Governments of Japan and other countries must more strongly condemn the country."
27,"I think that North Korea should use more money for food for the citizen, too.They should do that for their country's stability.Thinking about our history,there were many governments that failed because they ignored their citizen's feeling.Even if they have the strong army,they should not think lightly about citizen's power.For example,they should think about the Arab Spring."
28,"I was relieved to hear that North Korea failed to launch the missile. Always we can't predict North Korea's action,besides the interior of there is lack of stability now by changing leader,so we should pay attention more."
29,"It was a relief to hear that none of the people has been affected by the rocket. But my primary concern is other countries' nuclear test. 3 days ago, India launched a missile. It cannot say that India may do and North Korea must not do. We must not launch a missile whatever the reason we have."
30,"I'll revise my opinion to receive criticism from ID1212. Partly,I agree with ID1212.Japan should also persuade China into joining in United Nations Security Council's resolution in order to show much stronger condemnation. But,in reality, it's very hard job.China is said to gain much profit from trade with North Korea. If so,Japan will continue to take strong measure to stop North Korea's provocative action."
31,"I thought that North Korea doesn't govern to the people, though its name is Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After I saw this news, my opinion is more strong. North Korea have to spend money to destroy the nuclear energy' s factory and solve starvation."
32,"When I heard this news on TV, I was terrified and gave up on North Korea. Whatever reason they have, they must not launch long-range rocket. Because Launching long-range rocket must be a factor threatening world peace, of course around Asia. I think North Korea will try to launch long-range rocket again. We shouldn't miss their action."
33,"I think the Japanese government has a serious problem. When North Korea's long-range rocket launched, America got information about launch immediately. But, Japan took much time to confirm the launch. I fear that if North Korea's long-range rocket breaks up above Japanese territory. So, I think Japan should take a hard look at crisis management."
34,"North Korea's government says the every people agree with current politics, but it has many problems -exile, Illness and hunger, for example-. I think the highest priority should be given to the health and happiness of the people!"
35,"I think it is very terrible that North Korea's rocket broke up around Japanese territory. If it had become reality, we might have suffered damage. And I think, if it were not for countries like North Korea, our world would be peaceful."
36,"As lest of others comment on the blog, I was also relieved of the failure of the DPRK's launching the missile. But, I think most Japanese does not realize the threat of that since they, I mean DPRK, always fail to do such a thing. Maybe that is not good thing so, we Japanese need to be more aware of it."
37,"In my opinion,we should think this problem from various angles.To be sure,North Korea should be imposed some sanction from other countries,as it disturbed order.If economical sanctions will be imposed, however,many people in North Korea will suffer from hunger and poverty.I wonder if people who are blameless should be punished.I think the most important thing is to show North Korean government how to manage itself and to go along with other countries."
38,"I have my opinion that however North Korea's rocket launch gave rise to criticism all over the world,North Korea will launch rocket again. But because of criticism by countries around North Korea,North Korea will fail to achieve its aim,supply of food and money and oil and so on."
39,"This North Korea's rocket made me think anew that North Korea is a very dangerous country. I think that they have more important things to do than reinforcement of military affairs, such as improvement of citizen's poverty and hunger. The launch failed, but I think they will launch a rocket again. In case of it, Japan have to be more careful and prepare systems perfectly."
40,"I have been interested in North Korea.So I was very surprised at this news when I heard it first time.I thought something might changed better after Kim Jong Il's death in North Korea.In fact,however,nothing changes against what I thought.Rather,North Korea goes worth.Someone should revolutionize the structure of North Korea. The launch of rocket failed this time.But North Korea is still serious threat to Japan.So we must pay attention to North Korea."
41,"I think this launch accelerate North Korea's isolation in the world. The 'satellite' cost a lot of money that would improve the people's life such as food, health and education. In the country, lot's of children around my age are starving and only a few upper class people lead a luxury life.Japan have to make effort to improve the situation."
42,"Luckily, this time the launch project has failed. But there's no guarantee that next time the result will be the same. Needless to say its very dangerous. Japan must continue to do economic sanction,and we Japanese should be cautious about that country."
43,"When I first heard this news on TV, I really felt sorry for the North Korean citizens who suffer from hunger and insanitary conditions. The governments of this company never try to use their money to solve such problems, or even more, they spend a lot of money launching those rockets....which will never be of use."
44,I am interested in North Korea. I felt relived that there were no casualties.And the horror of North Korea was felt again. The government of Japan should addressed more quickly. So Japan should pay attention to North Korea carefully. I want keep more attention to the news.
45,"Despite North Korea's provocation fell to the failure, they will continue to provoke. The countries bordering North Korea such as Korea and China are now undergoing severe political changes. North Korea will never disregard this chance. I think not only bordered countries but United Nations have to intensify the pressure toward North Korea to stop it's provocation."
46,"When North Korea failed to launch the rocket, Japanese government failed also. It failed to get information about the rocket. It didn't know whether the rocket was launched or not, and needless to say, whether the launch was succeeded or not. I suspect Japanese government have the ability to save Japanese people in a crisis."
47,I can't understand how the people want to do cosmetic procedure feel. I shudder at the mere mention of it.Bury the implant in own face? Its so horrible!
48,"At first, I thought it became safer after North Korea failed to launch the missile. A sense of security that Japan has a great technique reliably enough to intercept the missile supported my thought. But an article which I read after the English class made my mind. The article said that Japan has a 80% success rate in intercepting the missile. I was very shocked about it. If North Korea succeeded in launching the missile, it produced a number of casualties 20% of the time! We cannot guarantee that next time will be safe like this time so I thought Japan should improve the technique of interception as soon as possible."
49,"I don't understand the necessity of changing one's face through cosmetic-surgeury.Patients have to run a risk as well as pay much money. If they want to restore their youthful look,they can have massages instead of cosmetic surgeries.They must be safer though it costs money and time."
50,I don't know whether cosmetic-surgery is right action or not. But I believe that it has a big risk to hurt our body. I want to change my body but I will not to change it because it is too dangerous.
51,"I agree with the cosmetic surgery. Because I think it's natural for people to want to get beauty and being confident in own looks is very important. Actually, people appearing on TV program featuring plastic surgery often look lively and nice after the operation. So I also think cosmetic procedure including 'chin jobs' is one of ways to live happily for us and no one can criticize for that action."
52,"Having read this article, I recognized the sense of crisis and thought about what Japan should do to cope with it. But, what I want to say is that Japan should not just criticize North Korea for conducting things such as launching missiles but should try to know why they are doing this kind of provocation, and then we should find a solution."
53,"I think the main purpose of North Korea's long-range rocket launching was to boost national prestige and to congratulate Kim Jong-un for assuming the new leader. However North Korea's rocket launch failed. This failure to launch the rocket showed that North Korea lost prestige in a new order. Therefore I'm worried that North Korea will carry out the third nuclear test. Japanese government should watch out North Korea's action continuously. Concerning Japanese government reaction this time,I agree with ID1240's opinion. Japanese government needs to reexamine the ways of providing people with information to save nation."
54,"I'm relieved to hear that North Korea's long-range rocket failed, but also I feel very scary. There are some reason. First, I believe international relations is not good between North Korea and Japan. As everyone knows, there is the issue of abducted Japanese taken to North Korea. Some North Korean doesn't like Japanese, and it makes situation worthier. If a launch is successful next time, it is obvious that Japan would be threatened more than now. Second, I think North Korea takes pride in own country and abilities, and this failure will lead them to make better rocket enthusiastically. I expect they will try hard again and again and success in launching a rocket in near future. It scared me a lot. To cope effectively with a terrible situation, I consider that Japan should gather more information about them. Only a few information, we are not able to do anything good for Japan."
55,"When I heard that North Korea planned to launch the rocket, I was indignant at a lack of repentance. If I remember correctly, this is the third time to launch the rockets or missiles without the approval of North Korea's neighbors, like Japan. I speculate that this launch is for celebrating Kim Il Sung's birthday or appealing Kim Jong-Un's authority. Also I guessed that it would not be going to be well, so my guess was exactly right. Now, I am relieved that no one was killed in this matter. But I am afraid for the safety of the scientists of North Korea. Because the leaders have executed cruelly many people made blunders or resist the government. Since the leader changed, this action has been activated. If worst comes to worst, they have already died. North Korea may run a nuclear test or launch the rocket again in the future. In order to save the nation certainly, I suggest that the Ministry of Defense improve the system to announce. And needless to say, we should keep to paying special attention to this matter."
56,"As the article said, North Korea's long-range rocket failed. I am relieved to hear that. However, now I am worried about what North Korea does next. If they are going to make new rocket, it will make matters worse. I really want to say that Japanese government should think about North Korea's actions."
57,"Failure of the launch of the missile made me relieved. However North Korea is still furthering military development,so there are some uneasiness left. Military affairs of Japan is not prepared,so Japan will be threatened in North Korea. To solve this,Japan should elaborate the armament and the measure for protecting its own country rather depending on foreign countries."
58,"i think it is really hard say whether cosmetic surgery is right or wrong. because as ID1206 say, it is natural that people wants to be beautiful and also other people say surgery involves high risk. but i believe if person wants to be beautiful he/she should do surgery because advance in medical technology can get rid of person's unconfident looks and make person's life happier......maybe...."
59,"Many people say that they feel safer after North Korea failed the rocket launch, but I am not one of them. I am rather afraid that North Korea creates another rocket, likely to be a stronger one, to actually attack Japan. I think that the Japanese government has to be more desperate to prepare for anything that can happen. It is very important that the government makes Japanese citizens always aware of the danger they are facing and have them ready for escape."
60,"I didn't agree with the cosmetic-surgery at first because it cost a lot like 1million for just one, small operation. I thought it's waste of money and we should use the money for something else. But as ID1206 said, it's natural for people to want to get beauty. Some are not satisfied with their looking and envy their nice-looking friends. And in some cases, so-called ugly students become the target of bullying. So I understand their feeling. But I still cannot agree with the liposuction because it's just the result of lack of effort. If people want to get thin, they should reconsider their dietary habit and start exercising not just depending on surgery. I know some people cannot lose their weight because of some kind of diseases but in most of the cases, I guess such people are overeating. Anyway, I can agree with cosmetic-surgery except for liposuction."
61,"↑sorry, '1 million yen' is correct"
62,"To tell the truth, I don't really care whether they do cosmetic surgery or not. We humans have the right to chose whatever we wanted to do, so it's up to the individual choice. But if I were asked to do cosmetic surgery, I definitely won't do that. It seems very painful to me and, moreover, I feel sorry for my parents by hurting the body they gave me. But if an individual can augment happiness of his/her life by doing cosmetic surgery, I can't stop them. You only live once. Just try what you think is the best !!"
63,"I think it is personal liberty, so that it is up to her/him as ID1218 said. She/He do cosmetic surgery because she/he doesn't like her/his look and doesn't have confidence for her/himself. If she/he has a lot of money, it would not be a problem at all. Shizukamiyazato said he can't understand at all why they do cosmetic surgery, however, I can understand their feelings. To tell the truth, I did straightening teeth, and I believe it is similar to cosmetic surgery. Many women want to be more beautiful any time. We do diet and make efforts, for example, however, our efforts are all for nothing sometimes. It's so vain. These days, technology has been developed day by day, so I think she/he who want to be change should try cosmetic surgery once. I bet her/his life would be different from the past."
64,"I agree with ID1218 and ID1245's idea. Whether you have plastic surgery or not depends on individual liberty. If you want to become beautiful, you might have plastic surgery after deeply thinking risk of it failing. What is more important than this, you should not have prejudices against the people who have plastic surgery. Especially in Japan there is the number of the people who have biased view against plastic surgery. Incidentally I don't want to have plastic surgery because I am very afraid of being operated."
65,"I think it dependent on the person whether cosmetic-surgery are carried out. In Japan, many people want to change their bodies. It is natural to want to become more beautiful. But I don't think so. This is because I want to take good care of myself."
66,"I am sure there are a great number of people who wish to be more beautiful and imagine the result of cosmetic surgery. It is natural that living people seek the beauty. But I hear that it is too expensive and so risky that they tend to hesitate to have surgery. And, as ID1244's opinion, Generally Japanese tend to scorn people who underwent surgery. For example, some actresses whose figures have changed obviously are criticized on the Internet. I think this is the biggest issue about cosmetic surgery. We should be more tolerant to this matter. Whoever hopes and afford to have surgery ought to carry out without any hesitation. By the way, if I get rich in the future, I may hope surgery."
67,"I heard that straightening our teeth helped us build up our health. I don't think too much cosmetic surgery is good,but I don't clearly say that cosmetic surgery should not done. Having cosmetic surgery makes people feel confident and happy."
68,"I don't think I want to do cosmetic procedure because it costs a lot, and it's dangerous. But I can understand why many people want to do it. Of course, I admire the person who is a handsome. In the end, I think it's free to do cosmetic surgery or not."
69,"I think cosmetic surgery is a way to lead a better life. If you do cosmetic surgery and can make your life better, it will be meaningful deed. However,even though you change your face, you can't your life unless you change yourself. And it costs a lot and may be dangerous. So you should drop into deep thought before you do cosmetic surgery."
70,"Cosmetic surgery occasionally fails. So, this procedure has risks. But, I have no reason to disagree with cosmetic surgery. There are a lot of people who worry about their own looks. For some people, this problem influences their lives and works. So, I think it is inexpensive to dissolve these problem to spend money. Anyway, cosmetic surgery is a personal matter. Other people shouldn't interfere. If we undergo cosmetic surgery, we should do our responsibility and judgment."
71,"I don't think people should not have cosmetic surgeries. Whatever we say, we are likely to judge others from their appearances. Therefore some people have senses of inferiority as they don't want to live any more. If they thought that they couldn't live without having cosmetic surgery, I think that will be OK. So I generally agree with cosmetic surgeries. But some people depend on cosmetic surgeries, run through their entire money, fail surgeries, repeat it endlessly, and fall into what we call 'cosmetic surgery hell'. Although I don't deny cosmetic surgeries, in order not to be in such traps, people should consider it again and again before having cosmetic surgeries."
72,"I think cosmetic surgery is very important to some person. Because it becomes a tool in order to lead a good life. When I dislike my face, it may be able to lead the life it is better to cosmetic surgery. So I think cosmetic surgery is not but."
73,"To be sure cosmetic surgery may be important to some people. I can understand their thought. But I can't think cosmetic surgery is good. At least I have not thought I want to do that. As many people said,cosmetic surgery cost a lot and is very dangerous. Doing something to body is very awful for me,even that is normal surgery."
74,"I don't think plastic surgery is bad. I'm not woman, but I can understand of hoping to be beautiful. One of my eyelids is with no fold, and other is double-fold. I really dislike them! Men feel beautiful to the symmetry things. So my face is not beautiful I think. I think if their problems can be solved by money, it's so good. It's the best way,no one feel sad, everyone feels happy, if you understand operations' danger."
75,"I think it's unnecessary to change each face.I have never thought that I'm handsome, and It's the natural that everyone wants to be handsome, pretty, beautiful, or nice face, however we should accept each inborn face.However ugly your face is, someone loves you!! In addition cosmetic surgery cost a lot and it's unsafe.In short I think it's needless"
76,"I can understand feeling of people who want cosmetic surgery,but I don't want to do cosmetic procedure. Because it take a lot of money and it's very dangerous. I think everyone should have confidence to face more. I looked at the picture of Bruce Forsyth, I was surprised at the size of his chin."
77,Thinking to want to restore our youthful look is good .So I think cosmetic surgery is not bad.However cosmetic surgery hurts our bodies and it's very dangerous.Under certain circumstances we died from cosmetic procedure.So I think cosmetic surgery is not worth taking risks.
78,Cosmetic surgery has been popular recently in the world. I think it should be important if surgery is not endowed from the parent face.I want my children to cosmetic surgery is not absolute.
79,"I suppose that these kinds of cosmetic surgery will be more popular in several years ,and that not only in the US but in Asian countries such as China, South Korea etc,the demands for them will be rapidly increasing year after year. Today,these operations still cost too much,but as the technology is improving,these cost will lessen and many more people will undergo them without thinking seriously."
80,"I think that we have freedom of choice. But it costs patients a lot of money to be operated on for cosmetic surgery and maintain their bodies or face. Furthermore, as the article, if people are operated, most of them come to want to be modify other parts. In the end, their bodies or face will lose their shapes. It is true that if you are operated, you may be beautiful and gain confidence. However, it is the only short term. So I strongly believe that it is better that you aren't operated."
81,"A chin is charge of various functions such as mastication. Thus if we have cosmetic surgery on our chin, we may look nice, but the original functions may decline at the same time. I think we shouldn't have cosmetic surgery which exposes us to health hazards."
82,"In Japan, implants are unusual surgery. The patients try to hide that they did cosmetic surgery. This is because Japanese environment can't accept cosmetic surgery as a usual thing. On the other hand, in America or Korea, many people do cosmetic surgery in order to become younger. It shows that America has many kinds of people in country, so that they are used to accept different points of each other. This is one of the good points of American culture. At this point, I think Japan should learn this culture."
83,"I tried to make good vocabulary notes every time, but I have never made perfect vocabulary notes. Also, this is the first time which I thought about how to write good vocabulary notes again. I saw some notes in class, and I could find what is important to make a good note. I should write meanings, parts of speech, pronunciation, accent, and examples. Moreover, I think world maps are important part for good vocabulary notes. By using world maps, we can learn not only one word but also other words which connect with one word at the same time. Word maps help us to learn many words. From now on, I want to make a beautiful vocabulary note in order to improve my English skill!"
84,I think it is okay to do cosmetic surgery if the person wants to do and need it. It is expensive and dangerous so I would not recommend the person to do so unless if the person really needs to.
85,"I myself don't want to do cosmetic surgery. I think what the person is like is far more important than how he/she looks.On the other hand ,I admit that there is a opinion such that ones first impression is quite important and it's greatly depend on ones features.So, I don't care other people do cosmetic surgery."
86,I think that the cosmetic surgery will damage your body or heart sometimes. The result after taking the surgery might be different from your ideal. I recommend that the person who wants to have cosmetic surgery need to think about that danger. I do not want to have the surgery because I feel so dangerous to have the surgery.
87,"I think that it is individual freedom. Desire to become beautiful is a natural thing.Even if it is able to sympathize, I don't want to have plastic surgery. Plastic surgery is different from makeup or diet,I feel like it is denying oneself. Moreover life does not necessarily become bright just because you have plastic surgery. Not only appearance but an inside is important. Things will turn out fine if you have enough determination."
88,"I think people who have plastic surgery abandon themselves. If you want to look better, you need to make extra special efforts. I never thought of having plastic surgery, but I have been trying various things to look better such as doing some running and restricting the amount of food for reducing fat. People should confront themselves and do their best to get better look."
89,"When I read this article, I think this news shows how Japanese and people around world feels about plastic surgery. I had read the article that 80% of Korean have plastic surgery (Not sure all Korean or only women). Also, many of them publicize that they had plastic surgery. On the other hand, Japanese want to hide whether they had plastic surgery. I think this is one of examples that show Japanese 'shame' culture."
90,"I have made vocabulary notes just like the first example of one. but,I realized it is not good when I read this article. My note is no accent and example sentence and so on. I think that word maps is good idea. It becomes easy to understand the connection of the sentence make a good note refer to this example notes. I will try to make a good note refer to example vocabulary notes ."
91,"I have made my original vocabulary notebook including collocations and word senses, for around seven years. It gradually contained a lot of information,so I have revised it several times. Recently I forgot lots of information on it. I think my note have two faults. First it is too large to carry . It is B5 size, so I cannot review what I wrote on mine when I am on the crowded train. The next note should be smaller. Secondly I have not written English sentences and word's meanings in English. That is why I easily forget what I wrote. When I make the next, I will improve those faults."
92,"I think that plastic surgery is no good. Faces are one of most characteristic parts of people. To process them would confuse their relationships, have a bad influence. When you want to change yourself, you should improve your inside."
93,"I want to refer to the third example of vocabulary note because each main words are very distinct and easy to find, also, we can remember the word family at the same time. Its knowledge will be necessary to write English composition. When I make my vocabulary note, I want to add the meanings of the words in an English-English dictionary. I think it can be useful for not only when we need to explain a word to another non-native speaker (according to this article), but also understanding real notion of the words. I really want to improve my English skill by ma king vocabulary note."
94,"I think most important for vocabulary note is careful. For example beautiful character, tidied up carefully etc----- Because carefully vocabulary note is motivated to us compared with a dirty note. I would like to refer to the first example vocabulary note. But it is not good as it is. It is necessary to add the above some element. I am poor at English. So I absolute necessity perfect vocabulary note. From now on, I would like to make the perfect note."
95,"So far, I have written only Japanese meanings and synonyms in my vocabulary notebooks. This method is adequate just for expanding the vocabulary and enhancing reading skills. However, in developing writing and reading skills,adding example and collocations to the notebooks will be better. I'm often puzzled about how to use words when writing and speaking. Now,I'll try this new method. Writing part of speech and pronunciation may also be good way of improving listening and speaking skills,but it must be much better to listen to native native speaker's pronunciation."
96,"I can understand why there are people who would like to change their body or face by plastic surgery. They believe that if they get their ideal bodies and faces, they could get their ideal lives. But, I think that plastic surgery is not good. Our bodies and faces are given by our parents. If we change our bodies and faces by performing operations on those, they must unpleasant. So, I don't think I would like to have any plastic surgeries."
97,"I oppose the idea of changing faces and bodies artificially. The effect of cosmetic surgery is not permanent. That is why some people is compelled to have surgery again and again. As a result, they could lose their identity. I argue that you should accept your appearance and make an effort to development many thing except for your one.Then you can get your confidence. **name** **name**"
98,"As you know, it is very easy to learn English in Japanese if you are not good at English.We Japanese usually think matters in Japanese,so I suggest them to learn English in Japanese at first. But after you get used to learning English, I mean after you have less problem using English, especially communicating in English, it is very important to learn English through English. That's because you never understand nuance of English if you keep on learning them through Japanese. I also recommend to learn English using an illustrative sentence. It is very effective to know how the word is used, and you can borrow those phrases when you actually write or speak English. But what we have to pay attention to most is that you shouldn't get satisfied just making vocabulary notebooks. What is important is to remember the words and have a chance to use them. You should make them in a way that is easy for you to remember in the most effective ways. Tips for those who is not good at remembering words: Aren't you using many hours just making vocabulary notebooks? Then stop that and reconsider why you are doing such a thing. That is to remember the words and actually using them in writings or in the real situations!"
99,"I think that there are three points to make better vocabulary notebooks. Firstly, you should write the words' meanings and accents. Of course, the purpose to make vocabulary notebooks is to learn the words that you don't know. It is easy to learn them by knowing their meanings . Furthermore, if you learn their accents, you can pronounce them. So you are able to learn their words not only by the sense of sight but also by the sense of hearing. Secondly, you should write the example sentences of them. By example sentences, you will be able to learn how to use them. And you can learn collocation. There are synonyms but words have also nuance. If you don't know collocation, you may not be able to convey your feeling. So it is necessary to write example sentences. Finally, you should write the images of the words. How to write is a picture, sentence and so on. If you have the images, it will be easy for you to learn the words. This is because the words become memorable and lead to collocation. Therefore, I recommend three points."
100,"When I learn new words, I lay emphasis on their practical use. If you learned a new verb by just memorizing its spelling and meaning, you will manage to understand the meaning of the verb in most passages. However, when you write compositions or speak in English using that verb, you will be at a loss about what is proper preposition for the verb ,or what noun to use together, or the pronunciation of it. Thus I think that there's no use making a vocabulary notebook only with English words and their Japanese meanings, and that you should write the co-locations, pronunciations, and part of speech of new words to make a useful vocabulary notebook. In fact, rarely have I made a vocabulary note so far, so I will improve my vocabulary by making and using vocabulary notebook."
101,"I started to remember the English word from the middle grades become, until now to write an English word to the left, we have to remember to write the meaning next to it in Japanese.Note that I can not explain the meaning to native speakers, however. I do not know well what I say with how if you did not write a sentence using that word again.And now I think I want to make a note using the color easy to see the English meaning, and example sentences using the word rather than just write the meaning of a word in Japanese so."
102,"When I was a high school student, I made my vocabulary notebook. But it was written only the meanings of the words. I think the vocabulary note is practical more. So I try to do new methods of vocabulary notes. First, I try to use word maps. But it was difficult to understand and taking long time. So I try to add the example sentences.Example sentences are useful for memorizing words.I want so I don't forget that continue to make the vocabulary notes."
103,"I have some complex with my face. But I haven't want to have plastic surgery. Because my face is important identity of myself. If you change your face and body by plastic surgery, it means that you lose your identity. If you change your face, you lost reliance and have more complexes about your looks. So I think that plastic surgery should not be done in any account."
104,"I think whether people decide to change their faces or other parts should be depended on their own mind.For some people who think their looking is not good,it may be wonderful that they can modify their bodies with new technology. But I am concerned about something.Do surgeons give customers enough information about their operations?There must be some risks with the procedure.The customers should know about them.The doctors should explain the details of the operations to their customers and the customers should think with that explanation."
105,"I am opposed to cosmetic surgery.This is because it may lead people who get the operation to being frustration.For example,Michael Joseph Jackson had had an operation in succession because of his wish that he wanted to be more beautiful."
106,"I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes of all. Whenever I study English, I feel necessity to think in English. I'm poor at English. So, I always think English sentences and words through Japanese. This thinking way takes much time and sometimes makes mistakes. So, I want to learn the way to think from English to English directly. I'm going to make a vocabulary note like the second example as first step for English-English thinking."
107,"I think that no one knows what the perfect vocabulary notebook is.Because we have different own English ability,so what we want to need about English vocabulary notebook is different from each other.For example,when I was a high school student I want to memorize English words and its Japanese meanings.So I devoted much time to reading.Thanks to this study,I know many English words and its meanings.But I don't know how to use those words.This study is of no practical use.So refer to 'Vocabulary Notebooks',I am going to search the most fittest notebook to me."
108,"There are difference between studying English and just learning English words by heart when we make the vocabulary notes. First, when we want not only to memorize words but also to study English, we should write many related words;collocations, word map, and synonyms on the notes. On the other hand when we just want to memorize English words, we should write English words and meaning by Japanese or English."
109,"I have made some vocabulary notes since junior high school student.There were various notes.I have already tried first,second and third examples of this article.And I like the style of first example.I think that type is clear and easiest to memorize.Of course, it is useful that there are English meanings or example sentences and I can remember other information.But my notes with too many information were often complex and it was hard to continue to memorize the words.So I want to try other type of notebooks but try not to make too complex notebooks.I want to create notebooks that are best to memorize for me."
110,"I'm poor at learning English words. So I can't speak like native speaker. If the thing I want to speak comes to my mind in Japanese, I can't translate it to in English because my vocabulary is too poor. But I'm sometimes said 'Your English is not bad. Are you good at English?' I can't understand why they think it. But when I speak English, I try to use easy English and I think it is better to continue speaking than think of difficult expression. I want to speak difficult things, I explain it by easy English. So my best way to learn new English is to explain that word by my word."
111,"When I make my I wrote only Japanese meaning so far.This style is so easy to do.But,It isn't good for learning English. I think, is most effective method.However,It is lacking.When I make my vocabulary note next time, I will write Japanese meaning,pronunciation,and word family as third example.And,I will write example sentence,too.I want to make perfect vocabulary note!"
112,"I think English meaning notebook is the best. I have been made English meaning notebooks which written main word and synonym. It is useful because you can memorize many words at once. If you use this method, you can remember another word even if you forget word which you want to speak."
113,"When I made vocabulary notebooks, I wrote only English words, Japanese meanings, and synonyms. So I sometimes had trouble making English sentences because I didn't know how to choose the correct English word. By incorporating example sentences and word map like the second example and the fourth example, I can make efforts to realize the improvement of my English skills. I will practice these ways in order to make the best vocabulary notebook for me."
114,"There were only English words and Japanese meanings in my vocabulary notebook. I had thought it was enough. However, When I saw several notebook example, I noticed my notebook was incomplete. I should write accents , pronunciation, example sentences and family words. It may take a lot of time. But if I do not so, it'll take more much time to remember and understand English words. I want to improve my English notebook and make my English ability better!!"
115,"I have made vocabulary notebooks only like first type. It is easy to make, and it is specialized in memorizing only English words and their meanings. However, especially when I write English compositions, I have no idea on how to use and link English words, even if I know words and their meanings. Just being linked with their meanings doesn't consist right sentences. So it is necessary to learn collocations."
116,I don't understand why people want to change their own face. Their face came from parents therefor it might make parents feel bad.
117,I think North Korea will make a better rocket next time from experience of this failure. Japan should have a better military to protect own country.
118,"I thought that I have to improve my note. After last lesson(week), I thought I have to improve my note and did it, HOe\wever, I still have some points to improve. I realized that electronic dictionary has example sentences and pronunciations, but it is not enough to make a good note."
119,"After had a lesson which learn about taking notes, I had realize that my note is too simple. So, I improved my note within 3 points. First, I added example. I think memorizing word with example is important, example helps people to memorize more easily, and properly. Second, I marked a accent. Since flow is important in English, word cannot be a complete English without considering accent. Third, I added synonym, memorizing synonym provide people to memorize wide range of words, also it helps to write natural sentences."
120,"I firmly think committing a cosmetic surgery is not good. I always emphasis that naturality is the best. Naturality helps people to maintain own existence. Furthermore, It makes more variety world, society. I think having a cosmetic surgery means concealing own existence. Besides, however medical treatment has improved actually there are tremendous risk when doing cosmetic surgery. Sometimes cosmetic surgery brings terrible side affect. Therefore, I think doing cosmetic surgery is not proper."
121,"Though it is not interesting for me to make a vocabulary note, that is very important in order to speak English more fluently. I will make my own note soon and want to be a good English speaker. But i wonder how often check the words i don't know . If i check all the words, i must be tired. Could anyone tell me how often i should look up the words i don't know?"
122,It is good for us to mind ourselves and make ourselves better on outlook. But i don't think cosmetic surgeon is good for anyone because we are the children of God. We are given our own body and it's natural for us to differ from each other. So we should be proud ourselves and enjoy crude ourselves.
123,"I have never thought about the good vocabulary notebooks.so this article gave me the opportunity to improve my vocabulary notebook. I took in the collocation and synonyms for my own notebook.I think my new notebook will improve my English skills. But the most important thing is continuing,not beginning.Therefore,I want to continue using new vocabulary notebook."
124,"Personally ,I can't accept the cosmetic surgery because there is a high possibility of failure.If operation fails,patients will perhaps suffer more than ever before. But cosmetic surgical procedure may give some people hope. So I think no one can criticize such operations."
125,"I have never thought about 'What makes a good vocabulary book'. However in this class lesson I came to have a first chance to see many types of vocabulary books and to think which one helps more. I tried every types after the lesson and finally, I chose the one with English meanings. Now I'm using it almost everyday and it helps me a lot!"
126,I'm really sorry to be late for posting my comment. I felt you should think how serious it is to make your body changed. Your body is inherited and it is one of the evidences shows you and your parents are family. So you should treat your body more carefully.
127,"I was very impressed by this story. Even if she got to be able to walk by the support of the 'ReWalk suit', it must be hard for her to complete a long-distance marathon. she could walked about only two miles a day, and it took 16 days to finish the marathon. If I were in her position, I could not keep running. Although she could not receive the official medal, she must be very happy to get the special medals which a dozen of other runners made."
128,"I used to make vocabulary notes in many ways when I was high school student, but I could never make the best one. However, I found a 'better' way to make it. It's 'Word Map' style! I could learn many words by making and using this. One of the good feature of this way is that you can learn other words related to the word you wanted to learn at first. So I think 'Word Map' is a good vocabulary note."
129,"I received impression in this tale. Her challenge is very amazing and I respect her challenging spirit. If I am same position as her I will be discouraged. so I think she is amazing. And I think surrounding support is important for her challenge. For the reason,it was able to obtain the medal which is not formal as for her"
130,"Same as ID1242, I was very impressed by this story. To tell the truth, first of all, I felt the marvelous ability of the bionic suit. This ReWalk suit could prove that enable paralyzed people to walk himself/herself publicly. I thought that the stuff of the company that designed the suit had been enthusiastic about their works and done everything in their power for paralyzed people. I want to praise them. Also, I noticed Claire Lomas's great perseverance. As ID1242's opinion, Even if she got the suit, he must have made an effort and keep doing hard work for a long time. At this time she could not receive a medal. I think it is natural. However she should be considered to be one of the runners who could reach the goal. We ought to give her a big hand."
131,and their family.
132,"After reading this story, it made my heart warm because Lomas never gave up during the race and when she finishes her 26.2 mile marathon, other runners in the race gave their own medals which i think they were also cheering her to finish. and also i was impressed on advance in science that we know today. this story realize me how enormous technology is and technologies are upgrading every seconds and it is making our life affluent."
133,"I don't think that cosmetic-surgery is good. Because doing it costs much money and one mistake can cost a person his life. I don't agree that South Korean people operate with ease. I think that the face is personal,so cosmetic-surgery shouldn't do easily without considering well."
134,"I felt worried about North Korea's future. Because I would expect Kim Jong-un to reset his country,govern people to guarantee good life of people but he ordered rocket launch. To launch rocket and nuclear missile means North Korean people is more severe life. Now North Korea is further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts. I think that many countries,especially China and Russia should put pressure on North Korea."
135,"As ID1242 and ID1246 say, this news impressed me deeply. Her efforts and hardships must have been beyond my imagination until she completed the marathon course. I respect her efforts and achievement. I realized again that it was important to do it without giving up until I finish. In the future I hope that bionic suit will spread in the world and the people paralyzed below the waist will be able to walk as technology develops and bionic suit becomes cheaper."
136,"I think that it is very important for me to write good vocabulary note books.But I was a high school student,I had written English words on the left , and Japanese meanings on the right. Though I could pass the entrance examination war,I realized that I would forget vast English words and Japanese meanings quickly. To memorize them effectively, I think that it is the best method for me to use a map which students has divided the word into its different word senses.'Since English word has a lot of meanings, its method will enable me to memorize many senses with putting them in order."
137,"I have three impression things in this story. First,Wearing bionic ReWalk suit enabled Claire Lomas to complete the 26.2-miles.I felt her will was very strong. Second, a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. I think that they would really look up to her in a way which she was trying without being discouraged by adversity. Finally, she raised more than yen 11 million for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. I think that since she had many support,she would repay to the handicapped."
138,"When I read this article, I'm surprised that she decided to run long-distance marathon even though she became paralyzed. Most of all, I'm impressed by her toughness to accomplish the goal. I think this achievement will help other paralyzed people not to lose their hope."
139,"As many students said, I was impressed and surprised by reading this story. I can't imagine how hard she tried to walk everyday. It must be very difficult time,however, she bore her hardship! She made it and succeeded in her life! I respect her. I think I am not able to try hard like her. I expect I should have desire to improve myself :)"
140,"I was astonished at her patience and effort. She continually went on walking for no less than 16 days! It's quite true her bionic ReWalk suit made it possible for her to move her paralyzed leg more smoothly. However,more important factors in her achievement are her strong belief in overcoming the physical disability and her families' cheer.As she said,she sometimes worried whether she could finish the marathon,but she continued practicing little by little,encouraged by her families. Without these two factors,she couldn't have completed it.The disabled will be encouraged by her achievement."
141,I was impressed bu this story. I guess it was hard to complete a marathon in a bionic suit but she did it. I think many people have encouraged by her.
142,"I agree with the cosmetic surgery as I understand that everyone would prefer looking better. I would not hate myself not just because my looking is not perfect, but I would be more satisfied with my appearance if my eyes were bigger, face was smaller, and etc. Since the technology techniques we have today have extremely improved in the last few years, it should not be criticized as much for the people to have cosmetic surgery. Like ID1254 said in his comment, cosmetic surgery may give some people 'hope', which can be explained as hope to live, smile, and love themselves."
143,Technology and techniques*
144,"I think that the vocabulary notebook that words' meanings are written in English is the best. Because, it makes us to get used to English, and we can also learn other words when we look up one word. But, if the word is very difficult, it is necessary to add Japanese."
145,"I was happy after reading this article. It is recently said that science technology damage the Earth and threaten our life. It is also said that only think about convenient. However, science technology can help us such as Lomas. I think science technology will developed more convenient to us."
146,This story impressed me. I hope these technology will develop for handicapped person.
147,"Re Walk suit was very useful to complete the marathon. However, I think her emotional strength was greater. If I were her, I gave up to run to the last. I learned the importance of challenging through this text."
148,I was very moved by this story.I can't imagine how hard she made efforts.But I can understand this challenge was very difficult to overcome. I wish that this success encourage other people who have handicaps. I was also surprised at science and technology.We can't live without it now.I hope technology develops and makes our lives more and more comfortable.
149,"When I read this article, I was impressed about the bionic suit. There are many people who have handicap in the world. Because of some handicap, handicapped people have to give up normal life style. However, they also have rights to spend normal life like us. Thanks to this bionic suit, I think many handicapped people's dream will come true. I hope technology of bionic suits will develop as soon as possible."
150,"This news so impressed me.This British woman's effort is beyond my imagination.Marathon is not easy for a person with a healthy body.With her handicap,she puled it off.Her action is worthy of praise.And,I also be moved new technology.I hope developing of science save all of paralyzed people ."
151,"When I was studying for entrance examination,I used flash cards to remember English words.A good point of this method is that a word's meaning came into my head as soon as readying a phrase.However,I had a little difficulty using words in conformity with the contexts.From this experience,I enumerate several synonyms,clarifying in which context the word should be used."
152,"In my opinion, the woman's success is greatly owing to her strong will.To be sure, she couldn't so much as entering this competition without ReWalk suit. But, no non-handicapped person could succeed in finishing the race only because of his/her normal body.It is ones will that leads to the person's accomplishment.So, the suit only helped her coming up alongside of other people without any disability."
153,"I have read another article like this. A handicapped person is likely to contribute,make a fund which help people get over the difficulty. I think this is good!"
154,"Having read this article, I was so impressed with it. I think people in this society should learn how to make great efforts from the runner. And she taught us that you can do anything if you try or challenge hard. Regarding the bionic suit helped the runner finish the marathon, I was very amazed by the fact the technology has actually grown this far. So, I look forward to that recent technology will keep growing and give people a hope."
155,"I was pretty impressed by this article. I thought Technology could make an impossibility to be a possibility. This article is not only about the Technology but also about the Human Spirit. If she was not Lomas,or she didn't have the physical handicap, she wouldn't make efforts and be attracted our attention. Having handicap is not good, but she could succeed with it. Therefore paralysis had her to do well. I praise her courage and toughness"
156,"I am impressed with this article. I feel Claire Lomas has a tough spirit. Of course, if there wasn't a bionic suit, she couldn't complete a marathon. But, I think that we need skills and a courage to complete a marathon. So, I feel that we have to have strength of mental and skills to attain a great thing. I want to be a strong man. And I don't want to give up if I face troubles like Claire Lomas."
157,"I was surprised at and impressed by her efforts and strength. If I were her, I would only be sad about my handicap. However, she didn't so. She didn't lose her handicap, and she rather overcame it with her unimagined efforts. I think she would encourage many people who have handicap. I also think the bionic suit which helped her success is wonderful. I hope this suit will help more handicapped people to lead better lives."
158,"I want to celebrate her achievement and also want to put emphasis on Amit Goffer's accomplishment. I hope that more technology for goods for the people like her will be developed. For that,people who study the technology should be supported by nations or groups like NPO.Especially,I heard that many Japanese researchers have abilities to develop the technology like this.We should support them.Also,we have to think about people who need goods but can't buy them because of the luck of the money."
159,"I was amazed to see this article. Claire Lomas completed a full marathon although she has a tough handicap. I strongly appreciate and admire her great efforts and feat.I'm not one of the disabled but I cannot do such a thing. I think the technical innovations we didn't realize around 10 years ago made her wish come true. And I suppose she could not had got over her obstacles without many supports of her family, her husband Dan and their daughter Maisie, and her parents and this her great achievement will surely encourage the disabled all over the world."
160,"I was so impressed with this article. I think it was not easy for everyone to complete. The strength of her spirit is so inscrutable. The more technologies improve, the more we forget importance of effort to achieve something. Also, her great achievement didn't consist of only fine technology, ReWalk suit. I think this news encourages everyone, including non-handicapped people and handicapped people."
161,"I was encouraged by reading this news. I think everyone who read this news were encouraged too. Clair Lomas, who had disadvantages of becoming paralyzed, completed a marathon because of a bionic suit but I think that is not the only reason why she made it. She could not have crossed the goal line without helps of her family, her husband and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. What we can learn from this is that you can overcome predicaments if there are emotional mainstays you get from someone very close to you. Also, I was very impressed by her charity work which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. She did not satisfied just with extending her possibility, but she is also trying to open up more possibilities for those people who are suffering from the same situations as she had. Maybe, we have to not only focusing on a bionic suit but also on the importance of relationships between human beings, when reading this news. Do not forget that 'what you cannot overcome by yourself can overcome with the help of each other'."
162,"I was moved by this article. I thought she was so brave to have made a decision to attend such a hard sports like marathon instead of her difficulty. I think I can't do the same thing if I were her. Her guts was really great. And, because her husband, daughter and parents cheered her everyday, she could continue the hard exercise and success like this. I guess. Well, I want to be like Lomas. I want to success like her no matter how horrible adversity I will be faced to."
163,"Whose success is the example like this? I think it is a human power. Of course, the person helped by technology strove very much. And the technology was invented by the people who want to help another people. Many technology successes were not technology's successes but human's successes."
164,"I guess the number of gay people in Japan is much smaller than in America, so the gay marriage issue may not be so familiar to Japanese. However this might be one of the most biggest issue for people all over the world because this is related to the human rights. I believe it's freedom for all people to love somebody, but in reality most of the countries ban gay marriage.And I wonder why such many people in America are against the gay marriage. In my opinion, their rights should be defended."
165,"I was very impressed about this story.If I were her, I would have give up running marathon.so I think she is very tough!!! When her husband was married her,he did not mind her handicap. He is very nice guy."
166,"After reading this article, I made two remarks. First, I suppose it's important to have strong spirit and make an effort. If I lost my legs, I would give up even walking. In this case, though Lomas put on a bionic suit, continuous effort probably made her success, I think. Second, being supporters encourage people who work hard to do something. For me, parents and friends often cheer up when I feel sadness or stress, so I want to be a good supporter for someone at one time."
167,"This article is moved me. I think that Claire Lomas has a firm belief. But in the world, however strong belief she has, there is a thing which she cannot do by herself. I think that there are three reasons why she could complete a marathon. Of course, first reason is that she made efforts to run the marathon. Second reason is due to bionic suit. Third reason, this is the most important reason, is that her family supported her. Probably, if she practice running a marathon alone, she may give up. But she achieve reaching a goal because her husband and her daughter continued to cheered up her. I strongly believe that there is a close bond of family. Furthermore, I think that we should try to develop links of the charity which support people with a disability and people who became paralyzed. It is possible for us to become paralyzed or have disability by accidents. However, someone who became paralyzed can enjoy sports by using advanced technology like bionic Re walk suit. But it cost them a lot of money to use advanced technology. So we need to increase the number of supporters who participate in charities for them."
168,"I think that I agree with legalizing gay marriage. This is because there is individual freedom. Moreover, it is said that many gays have a lot of stress in their mind because they aren't accepted. So government should legalize gay marriage to relief their stress. If government legalize it, government should permit them to get tax benefits and adopt children. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly,when they get a job, if they tell companies that they are gays themselves, some of companies may not employ them. Secondly, they need to get mental treatment. Furthermore, they cannot give birth to a baby so government has to consider adopting children. But, in view of politics, I think that Obama made a big decision. This is because Christianity ban gay marriage. Especially Catholic stick closely to Catholicism. In other words, Obama's remark is the same thing as throw away vote of Catholic. These days, there is the trend of accepting gay marriage. But I'm curious to see how it will turn out."
169,"This is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. In Japan, it's the unrealistic problem yet. I suppose that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc. By the way, media says Mr. Obama's approval of such marriage is one of election campaigns. I'm interested in eligible voters' movement especially young people."
170,"I think that gay marriage is individual free.There is no reason for opposing, if they are fortunate. Why is it prohibition in the United States? I think that the reason is that children decrease in number. The gay couple should not have a child. Because a child needs a mother absolutely. And the child who grew up at the special home has a high possibility of running to wrongdoing. So I think the conclusion of this problem is very difficult."
171,"For my part,at present,I can't agree to the same-sex marriage.It is said some people are afraid of being loved by gay people,and also said the birthrate in the country may decline.Both of them I 'm afraid too.On the contrary,however,these view may have some misconceptions.And history tells us that there were many gay people in ancient Greece and the Warring States period of Japan,which indicates the gay rights is not necessarily the problem specific to today.Moreover,the Japanese TV programs show that there are many gay people who is proud of themselves. The more Japanese people know them,the more they may be tolerate to the gay.In conclusion, now I'm against gay marriage,but in the future,I'll change my thoughts if I have more information about gay people."
172,"Since I have an uncle who have trouble walking due to polio,I was deeply impressed by this news. I also heard of achievement in the study of artificial sight. This kind of achievement will be light of hope for handicapped people."
173,"I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. Gay people loves partners of the same sex as heterosexual people love opposite sex, so no one or no law cannot prohibit these emotions. Is the birth rate of higher priority than human rights? I don't think so. In addition to institutional manage, government should enhance the understanding of gay people to solve problems springing from prejudice against gay people such as difficulty in adopting children."
174,"In this story,we can see not only an achievement of a paralyzed British woman,but also the development in science and technology.I think these technologies will help more and more people in the future.New scientific developments may be changing the world. But encouragement from others is also important. I think no matter how well-developed science and technology,the importance of the ties that bind people will not change."
175,"I experienced empathy with Obama's opinion. As there are so many people in the world, there are various ways of expressing love. So I think it is important to understand diverse love, and not to have a prejudice against gay couples."
176,"When I live in Japan , I think that 'same-sex marriage' don't become the talk.In America, Mr Obama regards getting many votes for same-sex couples as the way to win in a sense. Meanwhile Mr Romney is against gay marriage. It is true that increasing rights for gay citizens is very important but I think that in the U.S.A. the religion has something to do with all things as such life. So we will have to see how things develop."
177,"I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity. she"
178,"This problem was hard to believe for me. In Japan, the number of same-sex couples is extremely small and the problem is not a big problem compared with foreign countries, Perhaps because religion is involved, such as. I agree that same-sex couples should be able to marry. If people fell in love a same-sex by chance, I think it can not be helped, and I think it is good if they get along in life. The number of same-sex couples in japan is increasing recent years. I think the problem should be more considered by society as a whole in japan"
179,I think it is individual freedom. Although I'm against to this. I expect that permitting same-sex marriage will cause a lot of social problems.
180,"I was impressed by this article, and I admired her success. It is not easy to decide to run 42.2-kilometer though she is paralyzed. This achievement taught that importance of having ambition and making an effort to us."
181,"I think that same-sex couples are able to marry because they love with each other. We can not say anything for that. If they can not marry even they love with each other, I think that it is not fair. There is no rule, like males have to like females or females have to like males."
182,I think same sex marriage should be legal. Same sex couple just love each other so I don't want them to give up to get marry because of the gender. But I think same sex couple should not have the right to adopt children unless the children understand about it.
183,"As most people here say, I agree with legalising gay marriage.Whether you love same-sex or opposite sex depends on you. It is wrong that nation prohibits guy marriage.However as hikari11o8 points out , whether same-sex couple should be allowed to adopt children or not is big and complicated question. Same-sex couple should be allowed right same as opposite-sex couple but considering children, children should be brought up by mother and father."
184,"As most of my classmates say, I agree with I think that gay marriage should be acceptable legally and socially. Humans have the right to love person without regard to sex. None of my friends have confessed that he/she is gay. But if I get friends who are gay, I will be ready to accept them. And gay couple should be given the rights that general couples ordinarily possess. I disagree with ID1244's opinion a little. As they say, I consider that deliberating children's future and feelings is very important and necessary. We must not shun these. However, if some of children show their own opinion obviously, we can consider that gay couples adopt him/her. We should not respect only our guesses too much."
185,"I'm agree to gay marriage like others do. I do think it's their freedom to have marriage with same-sex and have a family. However, at the same time, I'm disagree with the idea of same-sex couple to adopt children. I don't think it's something wrong to fall in love with same gender, but to child, it could be differ. Also, when children got old without knowing father/mother figure, they tend to abuse their children. So, I think it's not suitable to let same-sex couple to adopt children."
186,"I believe that same-sex couple should be equal with others. As ID1204 say, I think the religious is the matter for them. Christian don't allow the same-sex marriage, and that is why same-sex couples are difficult to marriage. I know the religious is important for them, however, it is strange that human don't have same equal right. We are all equal before the low. I strongly support same-sex couple."
187,"I was very surprised when I read this news.Even though the body was crippled in an accident,I was very surprised that she ran 42 kilometers.I have not finished the marathon.I would like to finish a marathon someday."
188,"When I read this news I was surprised.Although many gay people all over the world,I think that it has been certified in the United States and it have an appreciable effect.There are many gay people in Japan.I think that they will want to certified."
189,"The same sex couple should have some rights such as living together, getting married, and etc. But there is one thing should not be accepted, it is adopting children. Because, I think it is harsh for the children to know and accept the relationship of their parents."
190,Do I have to complete the presentation by next class?
191,"No, we'll talk about it in class."
192,"I think the marriage of gay couples should be legal as others said. They have their rights to live happily with person who they love. Well, but I don't think it will be. Especially in Japan, there are many people who have stereotypes to gay couples and this will not vanish in a short period of time. Although there are ones who think like I think, I suppose it's impossible to make allowance for gay couples to marry because it will be possible that those who married with same-sex partners will be persecuted by others."
193,"I think same-sex couples should be able to marry. If they love each other, why not marry? Everyone will have your love. Then, of course you'll want to marry your partner. Why must not same-sex couples marry? Though only they cannot have a child, it's important to marry. If they want a child, they can adopt. A lot of social problems are occurred if same-sex couples can marry. However much more people'll be happy."
194,"In Japan,there are not many people who are gay.So I have never thought about gay marriage carefully.But after reading this article,I think priority should be given to the both two people's feelings.Therefore,I agree with gay marriage.However,after marriage,they may be seen strange by other people.A lot remains to be done for gays to live under normal conditions."
195,"I agree with Obama's suggestion. This is because it is freedom of choice, which we all enjoy. We must respect the will of individual. I strongly believe we should treat same-sex couples as ordinary different-sex couples. In Japan gay people are not as familiar as in the U.S. So I suppose lots of Japanese, including me,are surprised at this news article."
196,"I think we should not have a prejudice against same-sex couples. Because every people have the right to pursue their happiness.It has nothing to do with which sex they love. So I agree with Obama. I hope that more people become to think any people, even he is different from us, are equal and have the rights ."
197,"Gay marriage should be recognized in Japan. There is no problem about it, but a constitution must be revised. The government should discuss immediately. I want all people to do a better life."
198,"I guess this problem will come to Japan someday. Then, I think gay marriage should not be legal. There has been some gays in Japan. And, they play in television. But, there are people who criticize gays, too. If gay marriage is admitted in legal, the government has to discuss and amend the law. And, it takes much time to do this. But, I think the government has many problems to solve immediately. So, I think people should not discuss this now in Japan."
199,"This had been the big problem in America from many years ago. I have many friends in NY, and also there are many gay friends. Compared to Japanese, my gay friends don't try to hide their special characteristics. I think this is the good points in American culture. America is composed by many immigrations. Everyone accepted this situation and many kinds of people lived together. This is why gay friends can live without some feelings of shame rather than Japanese. I agree with President Obama about gay marriage. Thanks to this rule, many gay people can love each other like us and this help them except other gay people in all over the world."
200,"In my opinion,same-sex couples should be able to get married.Of course,I know there are various religions in the United States and some people think it is a bad thing.I think it is difficult that ALL citizens agree with guy marriage.There are lots of opinions in the country.But I think 'the government' should not ban the marriage.If it ban the marriage because they are same-sex, does the government disturb the citizen's freedom of the marriage?If they love with each other and want to wed,the government can't ban the marriage."
201,"I think it should be followed to get married for same-sex couple. The first reason, I believe that there is really big love between them. So, I can understand their thought and want them to be happy. The second reason, orphans will get less because the same-sex couples can't make child by themselves. Of course, there are many things not to be followed traditionally, but to make everyone happy, we should change the rules or customs."
202,"I agree with Obama. Surely, same sex couples are rare. However, they are not definitely wrong. It is freedom whom they love. Guy marriage isn't different from ordinary marriage. Also it is important for us to admit various sense of value.So I think guy marriage should be legal."
203,"I certainly agree with what Obama has proclaimed. We humans have a right to love who we want to love and no one has the right to violate that kind of right. But Obama should also think about current situation of America. In America, still many people have the prejudice against same-sex love because of their religion or morality or any other reasons. So what I wanted to say is that we have to take into consideration of such kinds of ideas that people have in order to protect same-sex couples. What is best is that maybe gradually modify the thoughts of people who have a bias against same-sex marriage, not just ignoring the ideas of people who have bias against same-sex couples, and finally create a situation that same-sex marriage is a normal thing in the society."
204,"Scientific techniques enables us things like we have never thoght.A paralyzed person complete a marathon. This is really amazing. To raise the convenience is of course, to bring out the dreamer in men is a part of scientific techniques too."
205,"I'm in favor of gay marriage. The most important thing in democracy is to respect personal thoughts. Besides marriage is one of the most important event in our life. Therefore, gay marriage should be admitted."
206,"Though I know little about tax system, I agree with same sex marriage. Because they can't give up loving the same sex person. That isn't changeable. But I disagree with them to adopt children. For one thing,as they are both men the children won't be treated healthfully. Second,children can't choose whether they should be adopted them or not."
207,"When I read this article,I was very surprised,and thought this is very good news.In many countries and areas,same sex couple are not recognized by the public.Obama did so courageous decision.I wish this Obama's new method succeed.And,I think that japan also have to recognized gay's marriage right."
208,"I think gay marriage should be admitted.Because they love each other as usual couple.If this thinking of love was not admitted, it would be violation of human right.But, It is difficult to admit gay couple."
209,"I argue that the institution of marriage has traditionally been defined as between a man and a women. If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. The gay community has created its own vibrant culture. By reducing the gap of opportunities and experiences between gay and heterosexual people, the unique culture may crease to exist. **name** **name**"
210,"I was so impressed with her patience. If I were Claire Lomas, I would give up running a marathon. She didn't give up because people around her welcomed her from the bottom of their heart. I want to run a marathon someday,too."
211,"I want to make notes such as second example and third example. But I'm taking notes like first example. Although there is a lot of missing information ,but I think first example is the best note because it is very simple and I get used to making it."
212,"Barack Obama said that same-sex couples should be able to get married. But still it is a very difficult problem. In my opinion, same-sex couples should not be able to married. Many people have a bias against gay couples and cannot accept their idea now. I don't agree with gay marriage as yet."
213,"As Barack Obama said, I think same-sex couple marriage should be allowed in other countries too.It is something to do with the human rights and everyone should be free.There is no way that they can stop them getting together."
214,"As to gay marriage,I agree to it.It's because people should have the right to choose partner who would make ones life more precious,I think. But,I can only feel that the president,announcing like this, thinks too much about gaining supports from those back gay marriage for following election.As a result,it's not clear to me if he really has strong creed to pay attention to same sex couples. Of course,I admit that by showing his favor to the couples,more or less,people has something positive to them,so it couldn't necessarily be said too much selfish."
215,"I was so impressed by this article, too. And I thought her achievement was supported by not only the technology but her strong spirit and cooperation between her and people around her. So this is why this article attract many people, I think."
216,"As many people said, i think this is individual problem. and what President Obama said is very courageous. I think same-sex marriage should be allow. Because i think marriage only relates to two people who wants to marry, and if it doesn't bring trouble to anyone i think this wedding should be allow. but if same-sex marriage cause any problem, we should ban as soon as possible."
217,"I think same-sex couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful.But,people have the right to love irrespective of sex,age and nationality.So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex couples should have the right to adapt children.Certainly, if they have a child,they can enjoy true family life.However,many problem may happen to their children.For ,children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex couples.And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway,I think same-sex couples should have the right to get married."
218,"I think same-sex couples' marriages should be admitted. It is natural that you hope to stay with someone who you love. But, today, same-sex marriages are not common, it is difficult way for same-sex couples. I think Barack Obama's statement is very important one. I want other countries follow his examples and take actions for same-sex couples."
228,"When I heard this news first time, I thought I had heard similar news. I felt this is one of problem with death penalty. Death Penalty should be punishment toward crime, but criminal use this act to suicide. I think it's ridiculous, and felt same as Governor, but at the same time, It's not good idea to state that suspect should kill himself from where Governor stand."
229,"Having read this story, I thought the suspect was very stupid, but the Osaka governor is saying too much that the suspect should've killed himself. Instead, I wanted him to mention the after care system of the prisoner was not prepared properly at least."
230,"He wanted to die because he has no job and home, however, I heard he would got a job from his friend in Osaka. That is why he went to Osaka. He stayed one night at his friend's house, and he disappeared next morning. He committed crime to be killed himself, however, there is no reason to die because he would had a job later. Moreover, he didn't make any effort to alive positively. I hate the person like him, because there are many people who want to alive more such as patients, poor people and so on. He should try to live strongly. I expect that he shouldn't be killed because his request is DEATH. To punish him, he should stay alive at prison forever, and I believe this is the biggest punishment for him."
231,"At first,I got angry when i heard this news. It was so reckless and selfish of the suspect to kill others in the intention of being sentenced to death. But now thinking again,other than a individual problem,there seems to be other factors such as economic recession or high suicide rate.And I guess the lack of rehabilitation in prison and economic recession are much to do with this case.As he said,he wanted to die for the reason that he had no home and no job prospects. If the economy is better,the situation may be better.And he committed a serious crime only after ten weeks he was released from prison.It seems that the prison was not able to rehabilitate him fully. In conclusion,this affair result from both a individual problem and a social problem. Anyway,we must not admit such behavior and make effort to prevent it."
232,"We cannot say anybody should die even if he/she want to die, but in this case, I cannot help thinking that Isohi should have died before involving disrelated two people. Homicide is much more worse than suicide. It must not be condoned that the futures of innocent people are destroyed by others' selfishness. If the life situation of Ishohi's was true, public welfare should be strengthened as well for people like him. According to an article which read later, however, he might not intend to die by using death penalty system. So the words that he chose his victims at random and that he wanted to kill anyone so he would be sentenced to death might be a big lie. Anyway, he is a murder. He should take proper punishment."
234,"It is anger to have felt, when I heard this news for the first time. I feel anger in the surrounding human being who was not able to help two human beings as this Isohi. It got to know that investigated this news by oneself and some witnesses were taking a picture of video. When this was heard , I felt it deplorable. I think it required to help each other all together more at the time of an emergency. And this suspect,s action is it being unusual and not allowed. Therefore the right severe punishment is required."
237,"After I read news, I was unable to repress my indignation. I concern with the families and friends of two victims. They lost precious one in an instant. I cannot even imagine their feeling. They should hope death penalty for the suspect, Kyozo Isohi. I guess that if the companions of my student union or someone I love are killed by strangers, I will desire to take revenge. This way to think is very natural for all human beings. However, we should not take these feelings too much. When the punishment is determined, we must take an objective view. And I am against ID1242. Suicide is a kind of homicide. In other words, Suicide is equal to homicide. Of course, I do not forgive Isohi's crime. In order to not force those who suffer extreme poverty to kill themselves or want to die, the social security system should be prepared. Recently I heard that some people abuse this system. Needless to say, they quit their evildoing. I expect that the government revise the system or law immediately."
239,"When I heard this news for the first time, I thought that a murder case happened again. I understood that it was indiscreet thought not to believe it in an unusual case. Then I considered that a man who believe that a case of murder is not unusual was unusual: strange!! Therefore I felt myself scary."
240,"I disagree with plastic surgery in two ways. Firstly, plastic surgery can industrialize the medical system. As our society is appearance-oriented, plastic surgery is in high demand. Plastic surgeons can make a lot of money these days as well. Thus, many medical students apply to specialize in plastic surgery. On the other hand, specializations important for public health, like internal medicine and general surgery are waning due to the lack of talent, as these departments promises significantly lower pay as compared to being a plastic surgeon. This tendency polarizes the medical system and threatens public health. Secondly, plastic surgery can undermine individuality. With the plastic surgery, people can transform their appearance to whatever they want. Because media broadcasts a unified look, people admire that particular appearance, and seek to achieve that through plastic surgery. Thus it can be said that plastic surgery and the media makes people lose their individuality. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with plastic surgery."
241,"I agree with homosexual marriages. I think prohibiting gay marriages runs counter to human rights. We investigate gay people's human rights with respect to marriage. In my opinion, happiness possessing rights, equality rights and privacy rights are violated in this scenario. The entitlement of happiness possessing rights is already guaranteed by first amendment in Virginia Bill of Rights. It is stipulated in 13rd amendment of constitution of japan too. Freedoms without distinction of any kind of status are guaranteed by Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutions of most countries guarantee this right too. And in 2003, Texas Supreme Court judged that the prohibition of homosexual activity is against the right of privacy. Actually, many countries like Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, Canada, Argentina permit same sex couple marriage. In fact the Netherlands have law of anti-distinction. According to this law, gays have the same rights as heterosexual couples."
242,This is reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage
244,"I agree with Obama's opinion. The right to marry must be given to every people equally, and it enables us to live with someone. If someone loves others of the same sex, no one can criticize them and keep them from being happy. It is free to love whoever."
247,"I make a vocabulary notebook from when I was a junior high school student.It is like first example…but, after I see those some way of making notes, I thought that I should reconsider my vocabulary notebook!! I think it is better that there are example sentences and the word's pronunciation for my improvement of English skill.In this class, I could know good ways of making notes!! thank you!!"
248,"This article was surprising for me. I could not believe the first…but, this is the fact. I can't imagine her despair when she know that she can't walk by herself. However, she never gave up and walk and walk…in the end, she was able to achieve!! I was moved this story."
250,"I think that no one bother the right to say persons they love, '' I love you.'' This is a human right, of course, whether male or female. Nothing is crueler than that this right is denied. It is natural that they would like to marry and live with their lovers. So, I support Obama's opinion at this point. Why are there a right to forbid their love?"
251,"When I heard this news, I was shocked.And, I was so angry.The murder had to kill oneself. I against the death penalty. When I was in primary school, the same murder case broke at Osaka. The man kills children in hope of the death penalty. We have to abolish death penalty to prevent such a terrible case."
255,"I remember street indiscriminate murder a few years ago in Akihabara when I heard this news for the first time. But I think this case's particular point is that the suspect somehow wanted to die and chose not to kill himself but to stab someone to be sentenced to death. If there were no system of capital punishment in Japan, such case could not take place. So I suggest that Japan abolish this penalty and adopt stricter life sentence. I think unlimited life in prison is more painful and hard than the death penalty personally."
257,"After watching and reading this news, I thought that if he had wanted to die, he should have died by himself, not involving the other people. It is no excuse of killing the other people that he would like to die. I understand that we can not say you should die if you want to die, but I can say you can not take someone's life in any situation. It might be difficult for him to think about the lives of the persons who were killed, but I wanted him to think about that because they had a family, friends... They had their lives."
258,"I felt how fiendish the suspect was, when I read this article. He might have a lot of distress, but there was no reason why he could kill other people. We must not take others' lives whatever emotion we have. Maybe Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui would represent the feelings of victims and their families."
259,"I felt the same way as the Osaka governor say. Thinking of the victim's feeling,it is beyond description. I think that the reason of this case happened is that because Japan's punishment are not heavy enough. We need to take the victim's feeling ."
260,"After reading this news, I thought that it is an only problem about his humanities. It is not nation's problem. He should not kill people and he should live himself. Suicide rate and death penalty didn't cause this tragedy. He presumed nation(Japan) . I think I said terrible and unholy opinion, but still he should live himself and shouldn't kill others."
261,"The suspect said that he was frustrated at having no home and no job. I think if he had them, he didn't commit such a crime. Needless to say, the most fact of this crime is his stupid thinking. But it is also one of fact that support for him (he has criminal record) was lacking. This is social problem, and we have to consider 'support for a person with a criminal record'."
262,"After reading this news, I thought we should rethink about our death penalty system. This case happened because Japan have death penalty to person who kill other people. and as Kyozo said he was frustrated at having no home and no job after he was released from prison, so we also should think about how to do with the criminal after he/she is release. Therefore, I think this case represents a problem in society and we need to think about carefully more to make better future life."
263,"After I read this news, I thought there were big problem in Japanese criminal system. I suspect that Japanese criminal system is used badly by criminal. In addition to this case , similar cases occurred in Japan. For instance the people who want to live without working do criminal act for food and shelter in jail. They intentionally do criminal act to get food and shelter in jail. They want to be sent to jail!! I think that Japan criminal system should be rethought deeply from this news"
264,"It was unbelievable that the suspect killed in a knife attack at random to want to die. I want him not to roll up many people only for his circumstances. In addition, it is problem to have one of the world's highest suicide rates."
265,"I thought that it was a dangerous problem, when this news was read. If population decreases as it is and elderly people increase in number, economy will contract. Therefore, the environment where elderly people can do work is required. If elderly people cannot do work, economy will reduce further. it is important to support a young man's child rearing at elderly people working."
266,"This problem will occur in near future. So it is important to think about it from now. Japan has a lot of debt ,so we can't rely on social security. I think making elderly people possible to work for a long period is good idea."
267,"Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder."
268,"When I read this news, I felt the suspect was very selfish. I think Japan shouldn't abolish the death penalty. The most important purpose of prisons is to do the rehabilitation of offenders. But, there are some prisoners who don't want to return to society like this time. Prisons are managed by tax. It is ridiculous that tax are used such people. So, I think Japan continue the death penalty."
269,"I think this accident reflects Japanese social plobrems.Now in Japan, poverty and suicide become serious. We have to try to solve these problems. Then this accident presents us about the death penalty, too. Now that Japan is a minority in that it still has system of death penalty despite it's developed country.I think we abolish the death penalty.Because we are a human,and human can make a mistake.So we shouldn't decide other people's life."
270,"This news made me feel angry. Surely, his life was under difficult condition. However, there was no reason why he was allowed to kill others. His reason is absurd. And this affair includes problems of not only his individual but also Japan society, that is to say the business climate and death penalty. These problem should be thought out in near future. In this view, this news gave us something important."
271,"I became really sad at time when I knew this news. This is because two totally innocent people have died. The criminal seemed to want to die, but I roll up an innocent person and am absolutely wrong. I want to have a criminal compensate for a crime reflectively well.I want to warn a slasher from now on recently because slashers increase. An innocent person must be never sacrificed anymore."
272,"When I knew this news, I thought that this was a serious problem to greatly influence in the future in Japan. Elderly people of Japan increases steadily. In addition, it becomes the low birthrate and aging society because a lot of people who marry after getting old do not make children.Population of Japan decreases steadily as now, and I think that I lose the power as the country. I work hard at the making of child, and it is necessary to attach the power of a young generation."
273,"I think this murder reflects the present situation in Japanese. For example, many of Japanese people lose their work and can't find their stable jobs and they lose their hope for living. If the current situation such as the economy, doesn't improve, such a sad news as this will not decrease."
274,"This incident became a huge problem in Japan because the suspected killed 2 innocent people in order to kill himself. After he released from the prison, he didn't have money, house and family. This was caused by bad Japanese economic situation. Many people lost their jobs and families and they lost their ways of life. Japanese government should think about its economy in order to save our lives. I hope that this accident gave us a good opportunity to think about our lives and economy."
275,"We have to think this news from many perspectives. First, a point of view of the victims and their families, relatives or friends. Considering from the victims side, we cannot imagine how much sad and disconsolate they felt. The two important and innocent life was lost without a notice. The suspect, Kyozo Isohi, has ruined the life of not only those who have killed but also of the people closely related them. He made light of life. He should have deeply engraved on how important one's life is and there is nothing that can exchange with life. Second, the viewpoint of the people close to the suspect. He should have took into consideration of his family as well. What kind of feeling does his family have after they were informed of this matter? There is no phrase that can substitute for expressing their feeling. Third, the perspective of the suspect himself. Why did he have to take other people's lives? Why he wanted to die? Weren't there any way to stop this sad incident from happening from the beginning? He should have the retribution for what he have done, but is that enough? We cannot think this matter as an irrelevant matter to our life. We can say that this is only one of the result of the problems we have in our society. If we consider this matter as unrelated to our life and just hate the murder and sympathize with the victim, this kind of tragic incident will surely happen again. The next may be your family or yourself. No one knows. So what I wanted to say is that there is no doubt that what Kyozo Isohi had made an irreparable mistake by depriving two people's lives and he should retribute to his deeds, but it is important to think this matter as a social problem and take some action to improve our society and decrease these kinds of tragic."
276,"I felt that the suspect,Kyozo Isohi was very selfish when I read this sentence. Since he did not have hopes to live anymore,he killed two men at random.The families of the victims will keep to envy him.If he wanted to suicide in fact,I think that he should not kill pedestrians,but kill himself.After all,I do not agree with death penalty.Because it is necessary for you to atone for your sin. I think that Isohi will need to apologize to the families of the victims for killing,atone for his sin."
277,"I was really shocked to hear the news. As Japan is thought to be one of the safest country in the world, that kind of accident should not be occurred. Also, I think the suspect is really selfish and what he had done cannot be justified. No one has a right to kill some one except for the execution, I believe."
278,I think that the woman cheer people who has handicap.Scientific techniques enables us to do things like we have never thoght.I want the handicapped not to give up anything because of their handicap.
279,"I was very sad to hear the news. Isohi is so selfish that two innocent people died. Though Isohi cannot kill himself, why can he kill anyone ? I argue that he should have killed himself if he really want to die, and Japanese government should review the Livelihood Protection Law."
280,"I was really shocked to hear the news. Though Japan is thought to be the safest country in the world,a terrible trouble is likely to happen.I think no one has a right to kill for the sake of oneself."
281,"After I read this article, I think about the death penalty again.Should Japan continue to have the death penalty?This problem have been controversial for a long time in Japan.Even if the man kill other people,does the country have rights to decide whether the man should live or not?Some people say that the death penalty make the numbers of the crime less because people are afraid of the penalty.But I think this affect of the penalty is questionable after we know the story like this article. We should think about the meaning of the penalty again."
283,"I can't understand his thought that he killed the persons in hope of death penalty, but I think we don't have to give him death penalty .…because he would like to die. So, it is not punishment for him. If he died, he wouldn't sad. It would make him be happy. However, there are many complex feeling of families and friends of the victims … so, which would be better , this is very difficult judgment."
284,"When I read this article, I thought that Japan should reconsider a capital punishment once again. The capital punishment is a thing intended to prevent a crime, but a crime does not seem to decrease to me because there is a capital punishment. There is the risk to bring the opposite effect like this case. I think that not carrying the death penalty but the criminal assumes one's crime and lives ."
285,"When I read this article, I thought that this was a serious problem. When the ratios of elderly person increase in Japan;the nation's economic prospects depend on making them productive. However, actually there are few places where the elderly can work by resignation and so on. I think that the government should think about the making of environment and the pension policy once again because Because the aged society will worsen more in the future."
286,"It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. → I agree with it's thought. Work place is important especially for elderly people in that they can have connections with many people. Retirement causes for some people not only poor but also isolation from society. Now in Japan, the system of social welfare is bankrupted, and the number of elderly people' suicides are increasing. To offer them their jobs may become one solution to solve these problems, I think."
287,"I think the suspect is very selfish. He killed two innocent people so that he wanted to be sentenced to death. I was scared to hear this news, because the news made me to think it is unpredictable when I was killed by a stranger, walking along the street. However, According to the news, he was set free from prison in Niigata two weeks ago. we have to take into account the fact that after released from prison, the criminal did not have home and job prospect, so he wanted to live no more. I doubt the support system for prisoners after they are released from prison properly works."
288,"As this article said, this case is related to height of committing suicide rate in Japan and death penalty. First of all, the proportion of committing suicide in Japan is very high. According to the graph which we saw in the class, the suicide rate in Japan is 20% and Japan is lying in third place. Also most of developed countries abolished death penalty, but Japan is carrying out execution. This peculiar circumstance will give rise to the case. Of course, I think that it is cruel case and I feel sorry that two people are killed by Kyozo Isohi suspect. But more important thing is that there may be people who have the same idea as Kyozo Isohi, who want to commit suicide but cannot do that by himself so wish to face the death penalty by killing someone indiscriminately. We will have to think about declining the number of such people."
289,"&gt;The environment where elderly people can do work is required. (quotation from comments) I agree with this opinion. Many aged Japanese have more knowledge and experiences than young people, so they can work to support or educate their next generation. In addition, I think people who work for something are very lively, in fact, 80-year-old my grandfather is now worker and live happily. 60 years old is not so weak and old actually. Of course, there are people who don't work anymore over aged 60, I suggest that elderly chose whether they continue to work or not when they become the present retire year. In the future, Japanese security services will be more powerless, so reforming work environment is the best way for nation as one of the developed aging countries."
290,"There are mainly two problems about this matter. First,this case brought the point at issue of the death penalty system to light.That is,the death penalty is legitimate murder.Personally,I think the death penalty should not be banned.But we cannot ignore this problem.So I think capital punishment needs to be reconsidered. Second,we can see the problem about a repeat offence.I think this is not personal,but social issue .I think all the criminals must be rehabilitated appropriately.Education and full support are necessary for them .Sometimes we regard criminals as dangerous and despise them.But another tragedy may happen if we alienate them from society."
291,"I agree with cosmetic surgery because all the people have a complex.If a complex is in appearance, and is improved by plastic surgery, the person becomes a positive feeling and can have confidence in himself, I think that it is good. There is prejudice for cosmetic surgery still more in Japan and will take time so that cosmetic surgery becomes common."
292,"I think the cooperation between generations is important to overcome this problem. The current social security system won't be sustainable because the system is based on plentiful young labor force and high economic growth. The number of young people is on the decrease while the number of elderly people who retired from their jobs are on the increase.It's means tax income reduces while the cost of social security increases.What is worse,the long lasting recession has already multiplied the public debt.Japanese government finances is now on the verge of corrapse.So it indeed inevitable that the rate of consumption tax is raised and the age when a person can receive a pension is delayed.But I believe we can take other measures in community. Some women are afraid that they have to quit their jobs if they have children and put off starting families even though they want to.Then, some elderly people have much experience of raising children and if they can help the mother bring up their children,more young women feel at ease and decide to have children.And some elderly people want to work but they can't get jobs because they are likely to get sick.Then,if young people do the jobs in place of them, more of them can be employed.In conclusion,young generation and elderly generation need help each other in order to get through this problem."
293,I disagree with Obama's opinion.Gay must be prohibited strictly. There is only one reason to think so.Gay is not correct in ethics.A living thing in the earth have to leave offspring.
294,"This article made me sad.Why the victim was killed?Nothing. These days a case of murder like this is more increasing than before. A generation ago,reason for murder is resentment or malice.This is changing."
295,"I agree with Obama's opinion. I argue that everyone is given some liberties,a thought,a property,and even marriage.There is a person who argues that if gay marriage is accepted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. But there are many orphans in the world. So,I think they are able to be adopted by same-sex couples."
296,"I think this problem is caused by long term depression. Young people do not afford to have their children. Even though you blame them for the origin of declining number of children and aging society, I argue that the government failed in stimulative measures is to blame too."
297,I was very impressed to hear the news. And I received courage and felt a weight has been taken off my mind. Because one reason is that a handicapped person such as Lomas taught us importance of effort and never giving up. The other reason is that science is of use. It is often said that science technology damage the earth and our life. I hope that science technology is good for us.
298,I was relieved to hear the news and I want to ring an alarm bell. Certainly North Korea failed to launch the missile. But a nuclear test will be made again. The national government did not show North Korea strong manner. I think this is the problem.
299,"It is inevitable for all humans to age. An aging society must come to Japan in the future. We have to take measures to deal with the situation. I also agree with ID1206's opinion. Unless the number of children increases suddenly and mysteriously, we need elderly people to work. And, maybe we should consider immigrants for the workforce. For example, some Filipina tried to become nurses in Japan and obtained certification. This is based on EPA between Japan and the Philippines. As a result, they failed and went back to home. The arguments about this issue should be activated. In order to solve the root of this problem, the government needs to enact a law to urge nations to have a baby. I think that the tax deduction for medical expenses is one of the effective measures."
300,"The environment where elderly people can do work is required. Like ID1206, I agree this opinion. Young people tend to be dinks these days. So the trend that the number of elderly people increases and the number of people who support elderly people decreases has progressed. Therefore it is important for elderly people to be equipped to live by their own. It may be difficult for elderly people to start new jobs or acquire some techniques, so I think that it is important to prepare a suitable environment that elderly people can continue their jobs and apply what they have experienced."
301,"I can't understand this murder's feelings. What is that he killed innocent two peoples because he wanted to be executed? Then why did not he kill himself? Certainly, he was frustrated by having no jobs and house. This is the very problem of current society. But I can't forgive him. However he was pained, nothing allow him to kill someone, not to mention of innocent people."
302,"I think that this problem will happen. In order to maintain the economy of Japan, Japanese government and laws allow elderly people to work longer if they want to work more. The population of young people in Japan is getting smaller, so the economy would not be supported by young people only. We need to think about this problem seriously."
303,"I was very impressed after hearing this news. She completed the 42.195km course even she had difficulty in working. I understand that the bionic suit was good, but her heart was strong therefore I was so impressed. I tried half-marathon in April but after the marathon I thought that it is hard to finish the full-marathon because I was so tired. I understand how hard the marathon is, so I think that what she did is wonderful."
304,"After I heard this news, I was getting scary . Because he killed innocent people nothing related with him. He was frustrating by having no job and no place to live. I guess there are some people in this world have same problem so he should have tried something or ask somebody to help."
305,"I think it's ludicrous to 'force' people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future.Adjusting pension benefits based upon age would also be appropriate in my opinion. If someone retires at 60, give them 60% of their benefits, 65, let's say 80% and at 70 everyone gets 100% of their benefits. I disagree with the opinion. Of course, there are even people who are over 60 years old and are able to work. But the Japanese economy is in a recession. Also the rate of employment in Japan has been decreasing for the past several years. So now many young people cannot get a job even if they are graduated from university. But if government adopted this system, more and more people cannot get a job. This is because the number of employment is more decreasing due to older people staying their office. People who are over 60 years old can choose whether they work their office or retire the job and receive a pension. So they have luxury choice. But if young people failed to get a job, they cannot earn a live. most of them will get a part-time job. But their lives are unstable. Moreover, if they have already been graduated from university, they will lose the chance of get a full-fledged employee. Such society is unfair. Therefore, we should turn our attention to the problem of difficulty of getting a job for young people."
306,"I think government should consider about it more seriously. I think elderly people should have a chance to work if they can because there are a lot of elderly people in Japan and it is increasing every year. If there are more workers, economic would be active because government don't have to pay much for over sixty-year-old people who can earn money to live. Furthermore, I believe some young people should work harder because I heard the NEET population is growing. They rely on their parents. It wouldn't be good. I think that that's one of the reason why they can't get enough money to have a baby."
307,I think this is very serious problem in Japan. Increasing the percentage of elderly people cause economic stagnation. So government needs to have a solution for that. Japan tend to retire when they got 60 or 65. I think employer needs to hire them only if they still have ability to work.
308,"I think aging population is a problem we cannot avoid from in nearly future in Japan but because many elder people were keen to work, I think Japan should abolish the retiring age system and change it to open-end system so many people can work until they are satisfied."
309,"&gt;&gt;It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. I agree with this opinion. Elderly people retire their job and there is few people who succeed to great technologies that are proud of Japan. Technologies are disappearing little by little, but certainly. That is so regrettable. And retired elderly people who has worked earnestly for a long time become more likely to be Alzheimer by having no reasons for living. I have heard that, and my acquaintances, for example my friends' grandfather and grandmother, was also so. Opportunities to work give elderly people reasons for living."
310,"I think this is an important problem for Japan's future. It may be easy for companies to employ elder people, because elder people have already the skills to work. They have experiences and intuitions which can be use in working. However, if companies employ young people, a lot of money would be necessary to educate all. I understand this thought, but it is young people that support Japan in the future. The skills, experiences, and intuitions have to be convey next ages. To solve this problem, the government should help companies to employ more young people, including us!!"
311,"'The environment where elderly people can do work is required.' : I think in the same way. I guess there are a lot of the elderly people who want to come back to jobs but do not have the opportunity. For most part-time jobs, young men is in great demand. I suggest public institutions should voluntary create new employment for the elderly such as a clerk, and a guard in a public facility. My city has 'silver jinzai center', the main aim of which is that people over 60 years old will register for it, and will be sent to the city's facility as labour force. Until now, I think , it has worked successfully. Therefore,I suppose if more and more public institutes should found their own centers like that, the situation will get improved."
312,"I think that Japan have to solve the problem.If Japan can solve the problem ,Japan may be the leading country.China will be the same situation soon.Japan's model how to solve aging society give any aging society hope."
313,"I think it is necessary to increase labor force as much as we could. However, I think to hire aging is not a good solution to solve the problem we are facing. I heard at least 1/4 of people who graduate university couldn't get a job. I think it's because aging don't give up their seat. Many workers feel the circumstance that aging occupy their seat, usually those are high rank, is bad for their company. Workers said that they are hard-headed and inflexible. I think it's important to let younger people to get a seat in company, not keep aging who can't get along with company."
314,"It would have been quite difficult for gay and lesbian couples in the current society as many people do not even try to understand the ways they choose their partners for life. In my opinion, however, same-sex marriage should be allowed because I think that no one has a right to force someone to love or marry only opposite-sex person. I guess that same-sex marriage is criticized especially by Christians who regard it as it is against God, but other than that, it does not cause any problems."
315,I think we have to make more old people to work and earn money by them self and stop them relying on pension. Decreasing numbers of working people can not afford increasing number of old people and we have to change the society to get on with this problem.
316,"After I read this story, I thought that the suspect was a very selfish person. Just because he wanted to be killed, he killed two person that had nothing to do with him and this can not be forgiven. He wanted to die but he couldn't kill himself. He wasn't brave enough to kill himself so he asked for a help to die. I understand his feeling but it is not a thing that could be overlooked."
317,"I felt very sad when I first read that two innocent people were killed and then it made me angry as I understood the reason of the crime. It was unbelievable that the suspect murdered the victims just because he wanted to die. I usually do not understand or agree with committing a suicide, but for this case, I strongly think that he should have done so rather than killing someone he does not even know. Also, it is important that he should not be given a death penalty which he wished but life sentence instead."
318,"I was extremely impressed by the story and also encouraged by what Claire has done. She has achieved such a great work in marathon not just because she was wearing a high-technology bionic suit, but also because she had her mind very set and tried amazingly hard. If I were running in the same race as her, I would have given her a big hug and told her that she should be very proud of herself. Also, it made me happy to know that other runners gave their medals to Claire for her great job. They probably felt the same way as me."
319,"I think that it is a huge serious problem that we all Japanese people should think about and find a strategy. For me, as 20 years old at the moment, I am worried about the incoming future we will be facing. It will be absolutely difficult for us to have such increasing number of elderly. Even though they are putting off their retirement and trying to work longer and remain active, there is a limit. This problem is most likely to affect the economic of the whole country and we are under pressure that we have to support the old people."
320,"After reading this news, I was very shocked. For solution, I thought that the old people should be easily hired to work if they want. By doing this, there may some benefit. In case working with young people like teenagers, the old people may teach the experience they have got from their long life and stimulate the young people. I do not think this is the problem, but it is a chance to get our age developed."
321,"I agree with cosmetic surgery. It is common around the world except japan. I think it depends on private liberty. Even though there is still a prejudice about plastic surgery in Japan, the time will come when it is in general use."
322,I think that this situation is very serious problem. Because keeping to increase people aged 65 or over will lead too heavy a burden for young people who are going to work in the future. Such a hard situation may discourage young people from working.
323,I makes vocabulary notebooks from when I was a freshman of the junior high school student. I am not good at remembering English words. So I made a lot of vocabulary notebooks. And I used to made vocabulary cards. To make vocabulary notebooks and vocabulary cards is best way to learn English words by heart.I learned a lot of things in this class.
324,"I was moved by hearing this news. Technology that helped her was very great. Nowadays, many people were bothered by physically handicap. So this bionic suits can help such a person. If many handicapped persons are helped by technology, the world will be better place. I heartily hope such a future made by technology."
325,I think that gay and lesbian couples have rights to marry. To marry is existing for lovers. There is no fatal gap between usual couple and gay couple. I hate people who discriminate gays and lesbians. There are a lot of people. So I think that each persons have their own right to be happy. Obama did great job.
326,I was shocked when I heard this shocking news. I think that Japan is a safe country. But Japan is not a safe country any more. I can not imagine there is a person who want to be sentenced to die. This is a last thought which human have. Japan should be more good place for every one.
327,"Thanks to the development of technology, the average lifetime of Japanese has continued to extend. However, most of the elderly people now do not have job because of the retirement. I don't agree with this system. We should not force them to retire depending on decided age, we should allow them to keep working if they are healthy and able to work. Now there are a lot of senile people BECAUSE they do not work and use their brain and once they get senile, it seems to be difficult for them to make it again. In addition, few companies are likely to hire elderly people because elderly people are thought to be short memories. I know it's very impolite expression but most of the people think like that somewhere in their mind. That's why I think they should continue to work so that they won't get senile. If they don't get senile, they can be very productive using their great knowledge and experience."
328,"This news is very terrible, because the suspect killed two people to be sentenced to death. We can say that capital punishment caused this accident. I think it is necessary for the people who are released from the prison to offer the opportunities to rehabilitate. Japan has to reconsider capital punishment."
329,"It is too selfish to kill people just because he would like to face the death penalty. I can understand a governor's anger well. It will be one method to abolish the death penalty if it does not become a criminal deterrent. Since we are the students of the faculty of law, we have to consider capital punishment carefully."
330,"&gt;&gt;It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an 'open end' retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society. Japan needs to change. I agree with this opinion. Nowadays, people aged 60 or over are still active, and many of them do volunteer work or so energetically. I think that the right time to retire depends on each person. Some of them want to keep on working after they retired. Others think that they want to enjoy the rest of their life. In this way, I think it is not a government job to tell people when to retire."
333,"what an awful news! This is my first thought when I read this article. I don't understand why this suspect killed other people to 'die'. Maybe he was too weak to kill himself, but I can't forgive him so easily. I feel so sorry for the victims, and the families of them.... Wish these kind of affairs never happen again. To make it possible, we have to check whether death penalty is really appropriate or not."
334,"&gt;&gt;Aging society is very serious problem in Japanese future. The biggest problem is that the number of people who work what is called working population is decreasing. These days the national economy is unhealthy. Japan is in huge debt. To resolve this problem, working population has to be increased and social security has to be reconsidered. I think it impossible to continue managing pension. Therefore Japanese government should formulate realizable policy of social welfare and should encourage young people to work harder. I mostly agree with this opinion.al welfare but It's true that Japan is now in a huge debt and there should be some way to solve this problem. Also, I agree with the idea of increasing working population and governments should formulate realizable policy of social welfare but I don't think encouraging young people to word harder will be a good measure. Young workers already have too heavy burden on their back because of our 'pension' system. I guess another measure that do not force young people to work harder will be needed."
335,"It is fear to have felt, when I looked at this news for the first time.Although the missile test went wrong this time,next, it may succeed. If it is a nuclear missile, Japan destroys completely. Therefore, a foreign country needs to put pressure more. So I think it is a international problem."
337,"This is one of the biggest problems in Japan. Because of bad Japanese economy, many young people can't get new jobs, get homes, and have a family. Also they don't try to make their children. This bad economy causes bad results in the future. I think Japanese government should submit the new amendment which can help money for studying or medical treatments for children. This needs much money for government, but this cost will connect with bright future in Japan."
339,"≫I think it's ludicrous to 'force' people to retire at age 60. In some cases even earlier. Japan seriously needs to rethink this for the future. If people want to retire that's one thing, however if they don't, or if they need to keep working then let them do so. I agree with this opinion. I also think it doesn't have to 'force' people to retire at age 60. It is good thing for the new comers to work with the veteran who have more knowledge or more experiences. And probably, the people who want to continue to work though they are 60 have high motivation. I think it makes companies be better."
341,"This news is related to us, too. Nowadays, even young people are keen to work, but there are few job opportunities. I don't know what to do for a declining birthrate and aging populations. So I want to do what I must do now."
342,"I disagree with the death penalty in three ways. Firstly, in history, there are many examples when the death penalty was abused politically. Governments can use the death penalty to announce their political will. Especially, governments execute those people who oppose the power of the government. In this case, freedom of people will decrease, and there will be an inflexible atmosphere, causing people to follow the rules of the government. Powerful governments can govern people in this way. It is more obvious if the government is a dictatorial government. They allow executions to eliminate an opposing party. For example, Iran executed a lot of people after 2009 by their 'show trials' because they wanted to repress their power after the blowing up of 2009. Secondly, death penalty is not effective at all. According to Roger Hood, The Death Penalty: A World-wide Perspective, Oxford, Clarendon Press, third edition, 2002, p. 214, Recent crime figures from abolitionist countries fail to show that abolition has harmful effects. In Canada, for example, the homicide rate per 100,000 population fell from a peak of 3.09 in 1975, the year before the abolition of the death penalty for murder, to 2.41 in 1980, and since then it has declined even further. In 2003, 27 years after abolition, the homicide rate was 1.73 per 100,000 population, 44 per cent lower than in 1975, which was the lowest rate in three decades. Although this increased to 2.0 in 2005, it remains over one-third lower than when the death penalty was abolished. Thirdly, the goal of punishment should be to correct convicts and help them return to society. It is stipulated in the international Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966) which states the basic guarantee of human rights in international society. Execution of death penalty is banned with this idea and the execution of the death penalty takes away the chance for convicts to regret their crime and apologize to victim. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with death penalty."
344,"I don't understand his thought that he killed other person in hope of death penalty. the form of punishment should be reconsidered. Moreover, this news makes us think about death penalty. Is killing really suitable for penalty?"
345,"This is very big problem in this country. Honestly, I don't know how to deal with this problem. But I guess the way to solve this problem is create jobs the opportunity should be given for elderly person. If they continue to work more 5 years, the situation may be better."
346,"when I was read this news,I was very impressed and surprised. I absolutely impossible for me to complete a marathon in the body paralyzed. If I were her, I would have given up. I think that they were encouraged when people of the same situation with her was heard this news. I want to develop more bionic suit."
347,"It is said that Japan will become aging society and declining birth rate. Experts indicate some causes of that. When I read some opinions, I feel that a provision for aging society requires a policy of the government. Japan is a backward country about support for people who does child raising and work. And, Japanese pension plan begins to decline. The government has great power. So, I think the government should do some policies. But, I don't think it is enough. Japanese style of systems won't obtain soon by changes of society. So, Japanese people should seek new systems by learning various countries."
348,"After I was read this article, I felt intense anger.Furthermore,I was heard that he had killed indiscriminately,I was so beside myself with anger.He absolutely should be the death penalty. I don't want such a case happening again."
349,"Aging has been a big problem for a long time in Japan, and it is obvious that we must deal with this matter. If nation's prospects are correct, young people will bear too heavy a burden and aging people won't be able to receive enough pension to live on. But this problem is difficult to solve. I think a solution that is shown in this article is good. But that is not practical because realizing a society where elderly people can work is not easy in this situation. Now, even young people who graduated from university take trouble to get a job. So I think many corporations can't afford to accept elderly people. We may not have the clear solution. But no doubt all of us must share part of the burden in some ways to tackle this difficult problem."
350,I agree with legalizing gay marriage. We should not have a prejudice against homosexual person. I think that Whether or not to marry is individual freedom.Gay marriage will increase in the future.
352,"The article speaks about the shrinking of the labor force. However, I think this kind of problem can be solved with making working place convenient to elderly. I think the most effective way for making the workplace convenient for the elderly is work sharing. According to a business dictionary, work sharing is a Method used for reducing operating costs without laying off employees. In work sharing schemes, working hours and wages are cut across the board until the organization's finances return to normal levels. The company can then work towards employing elderly. In this case, elderly can work more effectively because they can maintain work-life balance. Using this method, the elderly's hope for working can fulfilled. Furthermore, this method is effective for solving problems with low birth rate and so on. Many females put off having babies because of their work. However, with this method, Females can continue working in this style until their babies have grown up enough, and males can help infant care. These are my opinions on elderly society."
353,"For me, the article is impressive because the technology is used in a good way. I think technology is extension of human body. Thanks to high technology, human did a lot of achievement. This story is obvious example of that kind of achievement. These days, invention of high technology is always controversial thing among people. But I think technology is neutrality thing. People should not impede invent technology. But I argue applying of invented technology must discussion by people democratically."
354,"I think,it is so seriously problem for japan. This article said, many old people want to work.It is same as young people. So many young people want to get job,but there are not plenty of job.People couldn't get job often lost home, some of them starve to death. And, there is a problem of pension.Nowadays,few young people support many old people. This system is on the verge of collapse about to fall apart.If these problems weren't resolved,Japan would collapse ."
356,I think aging society is the most serious problems in Japan. A few young people must help a lot of old people. This situation must not work any more. So Japan must establish new welfare system. Japan have great deal of debt in the world. Aging society is the reason of Japan's debt. Politicians must be hurry to establish new welfare system.
357,"In my opinion, there should be death penalty because one should get what he/she deserves.On the other hand, we may have to think that there are some people who regards the punishment only as a means of suicide to escape from the reality. In that case, it's hard to say that the penalty works essentially. However, even if there would be alternative capital penalty, some people will also commit crimes in hope of getting the penalty to escape from hopeless ordinary lives. So, there aren't necessity to abolish death penalty. Bearing responsibility for what oneself does is quite important."
358,"Aging society is not avoidable. I think Japan should act for declining birth rate than for aging because we can't control the timing of people's death. So, I think also Japan has many debt and will be bankrupt unless Japanese government manage to declining birth rate."
359,"→The environment where elderly people can do work is required. I agree to this opinion. The reasons are as given below. First, feeling being needed can be what makes life worth living. Second, when a trend towards fewer children, being more workforce is essential to retain at least current economic power. So, I think it important elderly people to have more opportunity to get jobs."
360,I agree homosexuality because lave affair depends on will of the individual. However I disagree Mr. Obama's this decision. He use the problem of sexuality to win the election. Gay suffer from the criticism of society long years and they fight to win theirs rights. I think Mr.Obama's decision makes fool of their suffering.
362,"This news tells us serious problems. We must face them in near feature. Aging society in not avoidable for Japan. So it is very important to think how to deal with it well . At the same time, we should build the society that young people can have baby easier."
363,"When I heard this news,I feel so sad and angry.Everyone must not kill people and take their lives.We have to think about the importance and value lives.Nothing can take the place of life. I have doubts about police why they released the suspect from prison. I think they should see through his mind and get a thorough going over his release.I wish crimes like this news will not happen."
364,"I don't think this news is the problem in the future.we are responsible for this serious problem.We should manage somehow and find a solution of the birthrate declining and the population aging,unemployment problem.Otherwise business activity goes bad and people living in Japan will have difficulty making a living."
365,"'It is not a government job telling people when to retire. It is up to each individual's decision. Japan needs to change it to an 'open end' retirement like US. We have no mandatory retirement age at 60. Many seniors with special skills are still working and contributing to society..Japan needs to change.' The comment above is from the link to the news story. I agree with the idea that the individual freedom choice of when to retire should be entrusted to oneself. It is true that more Japanese elderly people is eager to work and Japan is in need of more workers. We should also think of people who do not want to work longer. There are some people who want to retire at the age of 60. So the government should stop telling people when to retire and entrust the choice to each individual. From another point of view, it is not always good to elderly people to keep on working especially in the big companies. This is because elderly extension of working will result in less adoption of young people. It is also important to improve the current situation of unemployment. Anyway, 'Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060' is imminent issue to Japan, so the Japanese government should try every possible means to stop the society from aging and come up with the idea to increase children."
367,"I think it is free for individuals to reform their face. Butt I don't agree to cosmetic surgery, because I don't want to reform myself. I want you to think well cosmetic surgery like this news."
368,"I think ReWalk suit is very good thing! Because I think paralyzed people are helped by ReWalk suit, also ReWalk suit bring the joy of walking for paralyzed people."
369,"I agree to same sex marriage. Because, I think this is freedom of individuals. So I think government should be permit same sex marriage."
370,"When I heard this news, I was very sad. Because the crime was took place in Osaka. And I think about the Death Penalty. I think the death penalty is abolished. The reason why I think so is people who exploit for themselves increase. So I think the death penalty should be abolished."
371,"I think this fact is very serious problem. Present Japan is aging society, so to increase elderly people is dangerous problem. I think growing the opportunity that aging people get their job should be conducted immediately."
373,"Before I leave this comment,I read the other comments above.There are many opinion about the retirement age problem.They say that the system should be abolished and the elderly people should work active after 65. The aging people have more capacities for the work than young people, so they can contribute to the society.I agree with these comments. But I think there are something to do before the abolition is done.If the elderly people continue to work more, some changes in the workplace is required.People will have difficulties about their bodies as they became older and the companies that they work have to have consideration with their problem like this. To stop the retirement age ,we should think 'What is needed for the society which the elderly people work comfortably?'."
374,"Human's pursuits of beauty know no bounds. If the patient feels satisfied, that's OK, I think, but personally I don't want to be operated any plastic surgeries because there is a big risk of malpractice."
375,"I don't agree with the cosmetic surgery. It's true that most of us have a hope to change our face. I think my face is our parents' present, so however ugly it looks,it shouldn't be changed. Moreover, changing the face so much is bad for crime prevention too."
376,"I was very impressed by this story. She ran marathon even she had difficulty in walking, it's so unbelievable and admirable. I belong to track&amp;field club in Keio univ, so I respect her spirit. And the development of technology is also surprising. ReWalk suit is hilarious thing, and it's very useful for disabled people."
377,"The development of technology sometimes cause bad effects like environmental pollution, but this news is a good example. The achievement of a woman with bionic suit makes a big hope for many people. I wish many more technologies will make our life much more comfortable."
378,"I don't agree with Obama. It's true that many form of love exist and I don't condemn itself, but Gay is ethically problematic. They can't leave offspring, so government shouldn't admit officially. That's the reason why I disagree with same sex couple marriage."
380,"Japan is now aging rapidly so it is necessary for the government to deal with the problem. Someone commented on this blog that it is not the government that decides when to retire, partly I agree with the idea,but I also think that it is the necessary thing for the government to decide it as one of the model for the companies. That way, people will realize how to deal with the problem efficiently? The point is, government needs to show us the model."
381,"I agree with the idea. In the past, transsexualism was not admitted socially,so it was thought to be really strange thing to marry the same sex person. But as the science, especially medicine, developed, it has been scientifically admitted that there are people who cannot love different sex people. So, I think the marriage of gay person should be admitted."
382,"I was happy to hear the news as the technology made it possible to do a thing that had been thought to be impossible. I've heard a phrase as following: things that human can imagine are the things that can be realized. I do not remember whose wise it is, but I realized it true."
383,"I am for the cosmetic surgery. It won't be a big deal to others, also, it would be the chance to make them feel confident. I suppose people who want to do it have difficulty feeling themselves confident. Cosmetic surgery surely help them deal such problems."
384,"→This problem will occur in near future. So it is important to think about it from now. Japan has a lot of debt ,so we can't rely on social security. I think making elderly people possible to work for a long period is good idea. I agree with this opinion, but it has a big problem. The problem is that the employment opportunities for young people may be reduced in exchange for the ones for elderly people. Please try to think who will make our future world. Before everything, we should promote the employment for young people, i think."
385,"I agree with legalizing same-sex marriage. Gay or lesbian people naturally have human rights. But in America, there may be many problems to solve. If most of those could be solved, the policy must be adopted at once."
386,This is very sad news. It must not be accepted that a man who wants to be sentenced to death kills many innocent and irrelevant people. He must be sentenced to death although he has wanted to be.
387,"I think it is good to raise the age of retirement to 70 or elder. Increase of elder people cannot be stopped any more, so companies should positively employ elder people. Besides, if the number of working elder people increase, income of pension also increases."
388,"When I first heard this news, it reminded me of the tragedy in Akihabara and I was really terrified. I can't believe why he did such a fierce murder. And then, I thought it is not a problem caused by a death-penalty, but just a personal problem. He said he had nowhere to live, no way to work, but it's because of his behavior. It's nothing but pretext!"
390,"I think it is too selfish. If I think I want to die, I kill myself alone. The people whom he killed didn't do bad things, there no reasons they should die. If I was their relative, I want to kill the man who killed my important person for his selfish person. Japan thinks death penalty makes people not to commit crimes, but there are people who hope death penalty like this case, it is not good to continue this rule I think."
391,"I support Obama's decision and I'm sure it should be admirable! To begin with, it's strange that the government can obstruct individuals' marriage. We have right to get married with our lovers even he/she is the same sex of us. We should think about this problem again with this as a start."
392,"I absolutely agree. It's a tremendous waste of experience and knowledge. And I've noticed that people tend to age more quickly once they stop working. There's something rejuvenating and therapeutic about being needed and earning a living. This is Alan's opinion, I agree with this opinion mainly. Japan has many old people, and it will be kind for them, it is impossible I think. Japanese old people can live and work very long. So in lives, Japanese people should work something."
394,"I agree the opinion. In Japan, It is self-evident that number of children will decrease and the aged will increase. This is a big problem we and industrialized countries in the world cannot avoid. So, Japan should become a model case."
395,"The suspect killed people in hope of the death penalty, so this case shows that the death penalty do not necessarily works as prevention against crime. The death penalty have many problem, so it should be abolished. Considering cases like this, its function as deterrent is questionable, and if the case were a false charge, there would be no mending. By the way, I wonder why no one tried to save the victims. The article says that the victims were stabbed again and again, so this means that other people at the scene of crime stood still seeing the tragedy while the crime was committed."
396,"I think this problem is complicated. If elderly people can participate in the labor market, they will be great labor force. Actually, In Japan, the system like this were proposed, that often called 'reemployment system'. However, some people point the problem of this system. The problem is that the system will be dangerous to press the employment of young people. So it would not result in success if the retirement age were raised."
397,"I think everybody can do the cosmetic surgery if they want to . No one has the right to stop them and also, people have the right to do what they want to. I know that all the girls want to look nice and pretty, and I think there are no problem about what they think. Some people say that 'your face is given from your parents so don't change it' but I don't think so . Children can't choose their own face when they are born. If people can't be positive or happy because they think they look ugly, I think they should do the cosmetic surgery."
398,"I do not entirely agree with cosmetic surgery, but if some think cosmetic surgery make themselves confident and positive, I think it's good. Recently, a more casual type of cosmetic surgery called 'Puchi-seikei' have become famous. Yet, there are some cases of failure in surgery operated by uncertified doctor, so people should be careful."
399,"I felt that even if the leader was changed, North Korea didn't change, or even got worse. The old-fashioned political system in this country need reformation, and should be democratized. To realize this, the most important partner of the North Korea, China should make move to change this country, but I think it is difficult."
401,"When I read this article I was impressed by Claire's family ties and encouraged by what she have achieved. She is loved by her family. I felt that their love and cheering for her encouraged her. That is why, I think, she can have made a decision to attend such a hard marathon and have achieved. And the story inspired me to greater effect."
403,"I was sad for hearing this news. However, the country has also responsibility. The country have to help a criminal who are released."
404,"I agree with Obama's opinion. However same sex marry is not accepted in Japan, same sex marry is proper. It is because they have right to get married with a lover."
405,"I was deeply moved by this story. She never gave up. It is hard for a person with a normal too to run a marathon. she achieved this without being discouraged by adversity. LONDON -A paralyzed British woman became the first person to complete a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Claire Lomas was in tears but said she was 'over the moon' as she completed the 26.2-mile (42.2-kilometer) course in her bionic ReWalk suit, which mimics the response that the wearer's joints would make if they were not paralyzed. Lomas, a former chiropractor who was left paralyzed from the chest down following a horse-riding accident five years ago, said: 'There were times when I questioned whether I would make it when I was training. Once I started, I just took each day as it came and every step got me a step closer.' She walked about two miles a day, cheered on by her husband Dan and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. Lomas will not appear in the official results and did not receive a medal when she finished as competitors have to complete the course on the day of the race to qualify for a medal. But a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. Lomas, who now works as a jewellery designer, raised more than £86,000 (￥11 million) for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. 'I have had tremendous support since my accident which I am so grateful for, some don't have that,' she said. 'Some people lose the use of their arms as well. A cure needs to be found.' The £43,000 ReWalk suit, designed by Israeli entrepreneur Amit Goffer, enables people with lower-limb paralysis to stand, walk and climb stairs through motion sensors and an onboard computer system.

Even if she got to be able to walk by the support of the 'ReWalk suit', it must be hard for her to complete a long-distance marathon. she could walked about only two miles a day, and it took 16 days to finish the marathon. If I were in her position, I could not keep running. Although she could not receive the official medal, she must be very happy to get the special medals which a dozen of other runners made. ID1250 | 16/05/2012 at 9:16 pm | Reply I received impression in this tale. Her challenge is very amazing and I respect her challenging spirit. If I am same position as her I will be discouraged. so I think she is amazing. And I think surrounding support is important for her challenge. For the reason,it was able to obtain the medal which is not formal as for her ID1246 | 17/05/2012 at 3:51 pm | Reply Same as ID1242, I was very impressed by this story. To tell the truth, first of all, I felt the marvelous ability of the bionic suit. This ReWalk suit could prove that enable paralyzed people to walk himself/herself publicly. I thought that the stuff of the company that designed the suit had been enthusiastic about their works and done everything in their power for paralyzed people. I want to praise them. Also, I noticed Claire Lomas's great perseverance. As ID1242's opinion, Even if she got the suit, he must have made an effort and keep doing hard work for a long time. At this time she could not receive a medal. I think it is natural. However she should be considered to be one of the runners who could reach the goal. We ought to give her a big hand. ID1246 | 17/05/2012 at 3:52 pm | Reply and their family. ID1211 | 17/05/2012 at 8:58 pm | Reply After reading this story, it made my heart warm because Lomas never gave up during the race and when she finishes her 26.2 mile marathon, other runners in the race gave their own medals which i think they were also cheering her to finish. and also i was impressed on advance in science that we know today. this story realize me how enormous technology is and technologies are upgrading every seconds and it is making our life affluent. ID1244 | 18/05/2012 at 1:46 am | Reply As ID1242 and ID1246 say, this news impressed me deeply. Her efforts and hardships must have been beyond my imagination until she completed the marathon course. I respect her efforts and achievement. I realized again that it was important to do it without giving up until I finish. In the future I hope that bionic suit will spread in the world and the people paralyzed below the waist will be able to walk as technology develops and bionic suit becomes cheaper. ID1255 | 18/05/2012 at 2:05 am | Reply I have three impression things in this story. First,Wearing bionic ReWalk suit enabled Claire Lomas to complete the 26.2-miles.I felt her will was very strong. Second, a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. I think that they would really look up to her in a way which she was trying without being discouraged by adversity. Finally, she raised more than yen 11 million for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. I think that since she had many support,she would repay to the handicapped. ID1210 | 18/05/2012 at 9:23 am | Reply When I read this article, I'm surprised that she decided to run long-distance marathon even though she became paralyzed. Most of all, I'm impressed by her toughness to accomplish the goal. I think this achievement will help other paralyzed people not to lose their hope. ID1245 | 18/05/2012 at 9:52 am | Reply As many students said, I was impressed and surprised by reading this story. I can't imagine how hard she tried to walk everyday. It must be very difficult time,however, she bore her hardship! She made it and succeeded in her life! I respect her. I think I am not able to try hard like her. I expect I should have desire to improve myself ID1203 | 18/05/2012 at 11:39 am | Reply I was astonished at her patience and effort. She continually went on walking for no less than 16 days! It's quite true her bionic ReWalk suit made it possible for her to move her paralyzed leg more smoothly. However,more important factors in her achievement are her strong belief in overcoming the physical disability and her families' cheer.As she said,she sometimes worried whether she could finish the marathon,but she continued practicing little by little,encouraged by her families. Without these two factors,she couldn't have completed it.The disabled will be encouraged by her achievement. ID1214 | 18/05/2012 at 1:48 pm | Reply I was impressed bu this story. I guess it was hard to complete a marathon in a bionic suit but she did it. I think many people have encouraged by her. ID1225 | 19/05/2012 at 1:34 pm | Reply I was happy after reading this article. It is recently said that science technology damage the Earth and threaten our life. It is also said that only think about convenient. However, science technology can help us such as Lomas. I think science technology will developed more convenient to us. ID1248 | 19/05/2012 at 11:02 pm | Reply This story impressed me. I hope these technology will develop for handicapped person. ID1216 | 19/05/2012 at 11:43 pm | Reply Re Walk suit was very useful to complete the marathon. However, I think her emotional strength was greater. If I were her, I gave up to run to the last. I learned the importance of challenging through this text. ID1234 | 19/05/2012 at 11:58 pm | Reply I was very moved by this story.I can't imagine how hard she made efforts.But I can understand this challenge was very difficult to overcome. I wish that this success encourage other people who have handicaps. I was also surprised at science and technology.We can't live without it now.I hope technology develops and makes our lives more and more comfortable. ID1209 | 20/05/2012 at 9:51 am | Reply When I read this article, I was impressed about the bionic suit. There are many people who have handicap in the world. Because of some handicap, handicapped people have to give up normal life style. However, they also have rights to spend normal life like us. Thanks to this bionic suit, I think many handicapped people's dream will come true. I hope technology of bionic suits will develop as soon as possible. ID1241 | 20/05/2012 at 7:46 pm | Reply This news so impressed me.This British woman's effort is beyond my imagination.Marathon is not easy for a person with a healthy body.With her handicap,she puled it off.Her action is worthy of praise.And,I also be moved new technology.I hope developing of science save all of paralyzed people . ID1231 | 20/05/2012 at 8:43 pm | Reply In my opinion, the woman's success is greatly owing to her strong will.To be sure, she couldn't so much as entering this competition without ReWalk suit. But, no non-handicapped person could succeed in finishing the race only because of his/her normal body.It is ones will that leads to the person's accomplishment.So, the suit only helped her coming up alongside of other people without any disability. ID1205 | 20/05/2012 at 10:18 pm | Reply I have read another article like this. A handicapped person is likely to contribute,make a fund which help people get over the difficulty. I think this is good! ID1243 | 20/05/2012 at 10:23 pm | Reply Having read this article, I was so impressed with it. I think people in this society should learn how to make great efforts from the runner. And she taught us that you can do anything if you try or challenge hard. Regarding the bionic suit helped the runner finish the marathon, I was very amazed by the fact the technology has actually grown this far. So, I look forward to that recent technology will keep growing and give people a hope. ID1217 | 20/05/2012 at 11:02 pm | Reply I was pretty impressed by this article. I thought Technology could make an impossibility to be a possibility. This article is not only about the Technology but also about the Human Spirit. If she was not Lomas,or she didn't have the physical handicap, she wouldn't make efforts and be attracted our attention. Having handicap is not good, but she could succeed with it. Therefore paralysis had her to do well. I praise her courage and toughness ID1227 | 20/05/2012 at 11:31 pm | Reply I am impressed with this article. I feel Claire Lomas has a tough spirit. Of course, if there wasn't a bionic suit, she couldn't complete a marathon. But, I think that we need skills and a courage to complete a marathon. So, I feel that we have to have strength of mental and skills to attain a great thing. I want to be a strong man. And I don't want to give up if I face troubles like Claire Lomas. ID1208 | 20/05/2012 at 11:39 pm | Reply I was surprised at and impressed by her efforts and strength. If I were her, I would only be sad about my handicap. However, she didn't so. She didn't lose her handicap, and she rather overcame it with her unimagined efforts. I think she would encourage many people who have handicap. I also think the bionic suit which helped her success is wonderful. I hope this suit will help more handicapped people to lead better lives. ID1222 | 20/05/2012 at 11:59 pm | Reply I want to celebrate her achievement and also want to put emphasis on Amit Goffer's accomplishment. I hope that more technology for goods for the people like her will be developed. For that,people who study the technology should be supported by nations or groups like NPO.Especially,I heard that many Japanese researchers have abilities to develop the technology like this.We should support them.Also,we have to think about people who need goods but can't buy them because of the luck of the money. ID1235 | 21/05/2012 at 12:12 am | Reply I was amazed to see this article. Claire Lomas completed a full marathon although she has a tough handicap. I strongly appreciate and admire her great efforts and feat.I'm not one of the disabled but I cannot do such a thing. I think the technical innovations we didn't realize around 10 years ago made her wish come true. And I suppose she could not had got over her obstacles without many supports of her family, her husband Dan and their daughter Maisie, and her parents and this her great achievement will surely encourage the disabled all over the world. ID1233 | 21/05/2012 at 12:42 am | Reply I was so impressed with this article. I think it was not easy for everyone to complete. The strength of her spirit is so inscrutable. The more technologies improve, the more we forget importance of effort to achieve something. Also, her great achievement didn't consist of only fine technology, ReWalk suit. I think this news encourages everyone, including non-handicapped people and handicapped people. ID1218 | 21/05/2012 at 1:02 am | Reply I was encouraged by reading this news. I think everyone who read this news were encouraged too. Clair Lomas, who had disadvantages of becoming paralyzed, completed a marathon because of a bionic suit but I think that is not the only reason why she made it. She could not have crossed the goal line without helps of her family, her husband and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. What we can learn from this is that you can overcome predicaments if there are emotional mainstays you get from someone very close to you. Also, I was very impressed by her charity work which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. She did not satisfied just with extending her possibility, but she is also trying to open up more possibilities for those people who are suffering from the same situations as she had. Maybe, we have to not only focusing on a bionic suit but also on the importance of relationships between human beings, when reading this news. Do not forget that 'what you cannot overcome by yourself can overcome with the help of each other'. ID1237 | 21/05/2012 at 1:41 am | Reply I was moved by this article. I thought she was so brave to have made a decision to attend such a hard sports like marathon instead of her difficulty. I think I can't do the same thing if I were her. Her guts was really great. And, because her husband, daughter and parents cheered her everyday, she could continue the hard exercise and success like this. I guess. Well, I want to be like Lomas. I want to success like her no matter how horrible adversity I will be faced to. ID1228 | 21/05/2012 at 10:18 am | Reply Whose success is the example like this? I think it is a human power. Of course, the person helped by technology strove very much. And the technology was invented by the people who want to help another people. Many technology successes were not technology's successes but human's successes. ID1256 | 21/05/2012 at 2:23 pm | Reply I was very impressed about this story.If I were her, I would have give up running marathon.so I think she is very tough!!! When her husband was married her,he did not mind her handicap. He is very nice guy. ID1206 | 21/05/2012 at 2:25 pm | Reply After reading this article, I made two remarks. First, I suppose it's important to have strong spirit and make an effort. If I lost my legs, I would give up even walking. In this case, though Lomas put on a bionic suit, continuous effort probably made her success, I think. Second, being supporters encourage people who work hard to do something. For me, parents and friends often cheer up when I feel sadness or stress, so I want to be a good supporter for someone at one time. ID1219 | 21/05/2012 at 5:51 pm | Reply This article is moved me. I think that Claire Lomas has a firm belief. But in the world, however strong belief she has, there is a thing which she cannot do by herself. I think that there are three reasons why she could complete a marathon. Of course, first reason is that she made efforts to run the marathon. Second reason is due to bionic suit. Third reason, this is the most important reason, is that her family supported her. Probably, if she practice running a marathon alone, she may give up. But she achieve reaching a goal because her husband and her daughter continued to cheered up her. I strongly believe that there is a close bond of family. Furthermore, I think that we should try to develop links of the charity which support people with a disability and people who became paralyzed. It is possible for us to become paralyzed or have disability by accidents. However, someone who became paralyzed can enjoy sports by using advanced technology like bionic Re walk suit. But it cost them a lot of money to use advanced technology. So we need to increase the number of supporters who participate in charities for them. ID1251 | 22/05/2012 at 1:19 pm | Reply Since I have an uncle who have trouble walking due to polio,I was deeply impressed by this news. I also heard of achievement in the study of artificial sight. This kind of achievement will be light of hope for handicapped people. ID1254 | 22/05/2012 at 6:31 pm | Reply In this story,we can see not only an achievement of a paralyzed British woman,but also the development in science and technology.I think these technologies will help more and more people in the future.New scientific developments may be changing the world. But encouragement from others is also important. I think no matter how well-developed science and technology,the importance of the ties that bind people will not change. ID1204 | 24/05/2012 at 12:52 am | Reply I was deeply moved by this story."
406,"I disagree to having plastic surgery. It is because there are no bounds to improve the section that we don't like in our face. So, it is wasteful to invest money in the plastic surgery."
407,I am in Obama side. I think gay or lesbian should be together if they love each other. Nothing can stop the feeling that you love someone. I also don't care that gay or lesbian got marriage.
408,"I can't understand why the suspect had to kill people. I strongly agree with Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui. The suspect of murder was frustrated at having no home and no job prospects, and that he didn't want to live anymore. It really week reason to kill people. I felt anger about it because, suspect could work if he had a energy to killing people."
409,"Having read this article, i worried about Japan's future. Elderly to account for 40% of Japanese in 2060 the article said. Young people including me, of course don't want to pay tax only for elderly. Tax payment will heavily task young people's living due to increasing elderly pension. I want to use my money for myself but I also have to pay tax. So, I should earn lot of money and study how to decrease my tax payment to be happy."
410,I really impressed by this story. I could felt people can anything if thy have a passion. The sadness being paralysis is huge I guess. She got over the sadness and trying to encourage other paralysis people. This action can be honor. I wish i have same passion to going school.
411,"Many people make fun of North Korea's failure in launching the rocket but because their military powers are quite violent, no one will be laughing when they succeed. I thought that North Korea's experiment in launching the rocket was fearing for Japan as we do not have military powers to fight back."
412,"I found it surprising that people are age want to have a plastic surgery. It will obviously make your appearance good now but I do not think it will stay forever. Appearance will be consumed by time anyway but loosing your appearance without it being consumed, I think it's kind of pathetic."
413,"Although she was not rewarded with a medal, I think it was heart-warming that she made it to the end with the bionic suit. In future, I hope this bionic suit will become much cheaper so more people who are physically challenged will be able to use it in their daily lives."
414,I agree to same sex marriage as long as they do not take charge of children in anyway such as adopting etc. This is because I do not think same sex marriage is a natural thing and it could lead to bullying. If people want to make same sex marriages they should make their children involved in their self-satisfaction.
415,"I cannot believe the victim that he did such a thing. I cannot understand why some people want to involve other people in their own death such as stopping the train and so. If he/she wants to die, they should without involving other people. I do not think he even has the rights to be sentences to death."
416,"I do not think we can avoid this problem with aging society and low fertility and if I can come up with a great idea to solve it, I think someone else has probably come up with it. But I do agree to the fact that many people are working for too long and this leads to poor employment rates."
417,When is the final test done ? It's on 7/9?
418,"Yes, the final test for us will be this Monday, July 9th."
419,"Many people are forced to live a poor life in North Korea but still they cry when Kim Jong ll died and they have high respects for their leader. I think this is because they don't know how the government works in other country and how people live in those country. I think that if North Korea has a money to make weapons, government should use those money to help nation have a better living. This missile problem might seem like it is a problem between North Korea and the country around North Korea but I think this is a problem essential to settle, to make North Koreans living better too."
420,"I am not against people having plastic surgery strongly because sometimes, getting a good looks would change one's life in a better way. But I still can't have a good understanding for it. Having a plastic surgery means that they will not be able to see their real faces or body again. Especially for face, it could also mean that their baby wont have the same look as their parent forever. And for their parents, they wont be able to see the face of their child that reminds of their wife or husband anymore. I think this is really sad thing. Now a days plastic surgery is getting easier to have and in some country it is thought as something normal to do. But I think people should think a lot before having it especially if they were young."
421,"I thought this is really nice and heart warming news. But I also have other thoughts for this kind of news. I've heard of the news that man who has a artificial leg will participate in a Olympic because of his great performance at the last two Paralympics. When I first heard this news , I thought this is really nice news just like I read the news about British woman who run marathon in a bionic suit. But then I start to worry about the fairness. Maybe wearing more expensive suite can make the runner run faster. Or maybe some player would feel unfairness to people wearing those things. But I'm sure that player wont be able to say so because it sounds unmoral. I think it is really nice thing to give chance to handy caped people but I also think that this is not that simple problem."
422,"I just can't find what is wrong about same sex people having a marriages. If they love each other why can't they marry? If it comes to a problem of whether they can have adopted child , it is difficult. But I think there are some ways that same sex couple can have a child just like we talked during class. I thought it is funny that hotels is Disney Resorts Japan announced that they will permit gay marriage at their hotel, right after the day Obama announced that he supports gay marridge.Though they say it was just a coincidence."
423,"I just can't understand how the victim could do such thing. How could he have a courage to kill someone when he doesn't have a courage to kill him self. Some people say that death penalty should be abolished to eliminate this kind of murder but I think it is not that simple. Because I think by having death penalty, we can avoid bereaved family do such thing as revenge."
424,"I think governments and company should support elderly people who wants to work more. My grandmother still works 5 days a week even though she is 74. And because she goes to work she has lots of friends and shares her hobby with them. Compered to her, my grand father quit his job long time ago. He stays at house all day and has no one to talk with. Now he has doubt that he has Alzheimer's disease. I think that if he could keep working more he wouldn't have got disease."
425,"All Japanese should not abdicate writing in their language. Because the language is a kind of the cultures. We need to inherit this culture. For that, we have to keep the opportunities to write characters in longhand. For example, exchanging letters with friends frequently is one of the ways to maintain the faculty."
426,"Many Japanese is said to lose their Kanji skills in the article.I think so too.I sometime cannot recollect Kanji which I want to write.However,I think that it is no need to make children write Kanji hardly.This is because there are dictionary."
427,"I agree with this article when I read it. Recently, many technical machines were invented by many companies such as computer and smartphone. When we write e-mail, we don't need to think how to write kanji. This causes this huge problems in Japan. If we write kanji by hands, there are many good points. For example, if we don't know how to write kanji, we can search it and also remember it at the same time. Then we can learn many other new kanji characters. We should solve this problem by learning how important kanji is."
428,"I think Kanji is one of the most important culture. We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently. So, we should increase the opportunity to write kanji."
429,"I don't think Japanese people is getting indifference to kanji. I often hear that the number of people who try kanji skill test are on the increase. As far as I know, many people still has motivations to improve their kanji skill. I agree ,however, that Japanese people have fewer opportunity to write kanji than before. We use computers to produce documents or use emails instead of postcards. Serious thing is that the lack of opportunity to write kanji can lead to the decline of whole ability to use Japanese. It's because writing kanji is not only learning the letter itself but also learning Japanese vocabulary. The most serious thing is that children will not be able to acquire kanji sufficiently. Now elementary school is the only place where students are taught how to write kanji and practice it through taking notes. If the computers are introduced into all the classes, it deprive children of the opportunity to learn kanji. For children, writing kanji on notebooks may be the best way to learn kanji."
430,"I don't know Chinese grammars well, but we can explain any words by using 'kana', so I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. Now in Japan, if you can write difficult words by kanji, you will be praised and thought smart. But reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing moment by moment, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again."
431,"I don't think the problem with which this article says that we Japanese are confronted is serious . First, as far as I know, none of us have already or almost forgotten the 'kanji' which we have to write by hand at least in everyday life. Secondly not only 'kanji' but 'hiragana' or 'katakana', Japanese traditional phonographs, can we use. If we forget some 'kanji' words, we can express what we want to easily by using them. Third even if we forgot some words, 'modern communications technology' could help us in certain aspects. Therefore I don't think that we have been in trouble with writing some 'kanji' in everyday life and that the problem is severe . It may be important to learn 'kanji' in the childhood and succeed this tradition, but we don't have to deplore that we lose ability to write 'kanji'."
432,"I agree with general ideas of Japanese that afraid of declining Kanji skills, especially future generations. In fact, smartphone is trend and it accelerates the problem, I think. However, Japanese should be able to write Kanji by hand correctly. Though Kanji is from China, I believe it is one of Japanese important cultures. It's natural to protect own culture."
433,I agree with ID1246's and ID1206's idea. We Japanese should continue writing Kanji by hand as our traditional culture. In addition I have another reason for this. These days some people that we need not write Kanji by hand because of computers and smartphones. However I think that we need write Kanji by hand to grow intelligence since we are children.
434,"Since we have many convenient technology like tablet , smart phone ,laptop. Those things give us less opportunity to write Kanji. I go university so I sometimes write Kanji when I need to write down during classes. But My parents said they mostly use computers during their works. it depends occupations but i guess we Japanese have few opportunity to write Kanji. If we lose ability to write Kanji we might lose cultural identity ."
435,"When I read this article, I think it's true like other people have said. I also think we have fewer opportunity to write Kanji. Some people who have commented said we have 'Kana' as well, and we could use that to write. However, I think 'Kana' is designed to support use of 'Kanji'. I think using 'Kana' mainly shouldn't happen. I think we need some plan to have more opportunity to write 'Kanji'."
436,"As we are exposed to smartphones and computers in our everyday lives, we have less opportunity to write Kanji. Naturally we start forgetting how to write Kanji. Some say that's a serious problem, but for me, it's not a big deal. Although we do not write Kanji compared to the past, we can't avoid seeing and reading Kanji in everywhere. We feel our ability to read them is not decreasing and that's why this article said that Japanese are losing ability to 'write' Kanji , not 'read' Kanji. Of course sentences written in only Hiragana or Katakana are extremely difficult to read, but in this modern society, we mostly use smartphones and computers when we contact people except for talking. We send e-mail, use twitter or line, create a Word document for meeting and so on. We can read Kanji, so we can choose correct one from character conversion. In conclusion, we can contact people smoothly even if we cannot write Kanji."
437,"I think that this problem is very serious.Because Japanese people have used kanji for a long time.This tradition should protect.But, by using kanji conversion function of phone, usually young people have not written in kanji. More over I think that even old people have not done. It is very important for us not to depend on phone."
438,"I heard that the sales of CD is now declining in Japan because of illegal downloading. Therefore we can see various ways to sell CDs like AKB 48. I think that it is necessary for the market of music to tighten the regulations to protect musicians.However they may lose their popularity and income. Because their fans can hesitate to buy CDs. Generally, the surplus tightening of regulations causes downturn. We need pay attention to this issue."
439,"The article makes me to consider whether we still need to write Kanji by hand or not. Even though 66.5% of people have fear against forgetting to write Kanji, they do not try to stop using electric equipment which write it quickly and correctly instead of you. But I don't want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they show it in the most simple way. Kanji is the most smart and interesting character in the world. Because they recognize Kanji's importance and convenience, so many people have fear to forget about it. Also, it is sad to forget the character which we have learned from young. It is no need to stop using electric equipment, but required to try to write Kanji by hand as much as possible, in everyday life."
440,"Today, many people use PC or smartphones, thanks to them it is not need to write Kanji correctly. These are great helps when we write a paper or send e-mails.I also sometimes feel I'm losing ability. But Kanji is Japanese important culture and we have to keep up this tradition. So we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji with hand."
441,It is deplorable that some Japanese people lose their ability to write kanji because of the spread of PC or cell phones. I occasionally write kanji characters making strokes in the wrong order. I've heard that people tend to be more tenacious if there is a reward for the effort. So I think providing opportunity to test people's ability to write kanji such as the Kanji Aptitude Test is effective in making people interested in writing kanji.
442,I agree that the Kanji is one of the Japanese culture but I disagree with ID1255's idea because i think if we can read it and understand the meaning perfectly there is no point for writing kanji i guess. therefore i think we do not need to solve this problem as soon as possible but we need to find a way to make future children to understand how to use them.
443,"I don't dislike kanji characters unlike this survey because they look cool and smart, I think. This news overstates the problem that we may lose Japanese kanji abilities. It is because we have few possibilities that we will decline and lose kanji in our daily life because kanji characters have taken root among Japanese for huge ages."
444,i think two years of prison terms and 2 million yen fines are went too far. i know downloading music or films illegally is bad thing to do but 2 million yen is too much. instead of 2 million yen it should be the cost of the music or film.
445,"I first heard this news about half an year ago. When I heard the news, I thought it' a joke because it's impossible to track down every downloads on internet. However, at the same time, I think this idea is good. There are people who felt 2 year/ 2 million yen is too far, but in order to prevent people from start downloading illegal contents or stop doing that, I think it's not too far. If we lower the fine like yukikamikura said, I don't think this policy work as punishment to people who downloads illegal contents."
446,This new law forbids Downloading music and movies on Internet. However this doesn't forbid just WATCHing movies and listening music on Internet. So this law couldn't aim to stop falling music sales in the music market.
447,"Same as hirohuminihei, I heard that the CD market is shrinking now because of illegal downloading. It's not to say that this law will not effect the behavior of people at all, I still cannot believe that this will be the solution. First of all, on purpose or accidentally, many people may have conducted illegal downloading and they know how easy and convenient it is. Most of them will continue to do illegal downloading unless they are arrested. And prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen is too hard for them to believe. I wonder that this number will give them some kind of relief that they will not be arrested due to this level of illegal downloading. For me, it's hard to believe that 1 or 2 downloading equal such a severe punishment. The punishment should be mitigated instead the number of apprehension should be increased and apprise people that they will easily be arrested. People will fear that the next may become them and the number of illegal downloading will decrease."
448,"The society changes rapidly now. It's natural that many people input a letter with a computer. But, writing a kanji by hand is needed. We should write a letter by hand since we were child. I want to regard more Japanese culture as important."
449,"The society changes rapidly now. It's natural that many people input a letter with a computer. But, writing a kanji by hand is needed. We should write a letter by hand since we were child. I want to regard more Japanese culture as important."
450,"↑ Sorry, I have commented in the wrong place."
451,I think most people don't realize that downloading free music will be punished. This problem won't be solved because as Yusuke said that many people may have conducted illegal downloading and they know how easy and convenient it is.
452,"People buy CDs because they are a fan of the singer or the group. Although there is a law to stop illegal downloading, I don't think those who download music will buy the CD.So this law would not stop the fall of the CD sales and to make CDs sold, music artists should work more to increase there fans.Lastly the most thing that I think is providing people not buy CDs are that CDs are too expencive.They should be sold at a more reasonable price."
453,"I really agree with ID1244's idea. I think that I have been losing my skills to write kanji because of smartphones and PC. However, kanji is Japanese culture, so we should not reduce the ability to write kanji."
454,"I strongly agree with ID1252's idea. As ID1252 said, most people do not think that downloading the music is bad thing to do. We need to be careful about these things, otherwise we have to pay fine. I do not want to pay it, so I am not going to take care about it."
455,"I think this news is natural. I always use a cellphone. And, I send emails. Then, I use many kanji. But, there are a few kanji that I cannot write. I have heard such news. Many Japanese can read difficult kanji. But, they cannot write. I am such a person, too. Recently, people reduce an opportunity of writing a character by hand because of an advance of science. It is not bad because I think although we do not write kanji, we can communicate."
456,More and more Japanese people is losing their ability to write Kanji. I also often can't write correct Kanji by hand. This is serious problem. There are many words which have same reading but different meanings in Japanese. Kanji helps us understand the meaning of the word. So we should face this problem as possible as soon.
457,"Generally, I'm in favor of this new law except for the unclear definition of 'pirates'. According to The Recording Industry Association of Japan,about 90% of downloaded music are illegal. If this trend continue, those who involved in music industry get less money and they lose motivations of writing and singing good music. Also,if musicians compose or sing uninteresting music, people cannot listen to up-to-date or magnificent music. The new law will stop this trend and secure the rights of musicians. On this point, the law is beneficial to both the industry and consumers. However,there is something I worried about. Too broad and unclear definition of 'pirates' can lead to excessive restriction of online freedom. People have no idea whether they will be punished when they download music because they don't understand what 'pirate' refer to. So there is possibility they have to refrain from downloading even legal music. It seems to justify extreme regulation of online freedom in the name of copyrights. The clear definition of 'pirates' must be needed in order to balance the rights of music industry with the rights of consumers."
458,"When I read this article, I wasn't so surprised.Because, I am feeling my kanji skill is failing recently. After I entered university, I often use computer to make documents. And, I sent e-mail everyday. As a result, I don't write kanji by hand much. I can read so many kanji, but I can't write difficult kanji ,for example, 'utsu'. I am afraid of decreasing my kanji skill. And, I think this problem is so seriously for Japan. Kanji is precious culture. We have to make an effort keeping own kanji writing skill. I'm going to try to write kanji by my own hand everyday."
459,"Some people think that this new low is quite effective for illegally downloaded music problem and falling music sales. But, I don't think so. The causes of falling music is that the sales of CD is reducing. When we want to listen music, we go to CD rental shop, or buy date of the music at iTunes. It's so easy and economical. If illegally download is prohibited, people will not buy CD. I think , Japanese music world have to devise different policy."
460,"I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem, especially to Japanese children. Nowadays, elementary school students are natural to have modern communication technology and this is the core reason why they are losing such an ability. When the adults were young, they did not given those devices so they are somewhat forced to write kanji, which means they are given opportunity to write kanji. But children today can get away from writing kanji and so they are lacking the opportunity to write kanji. In other words, adults today have the basic ability to write kanji because they have learned once and it is easier to recall again once they have built the foundation of writing kanji, but children today are lacking the foundation from the beginning and it can be too late to gain the ability after they get older. Also, some will say that you can learn kanji from modern communication technology and there are hiragana or katakana to communicate with each other, but it is unlikely to assume that the proper way of using kanji and tradition of using proper Japanese can be preserved through the device.( Not to mention the difficulty of communicating only using hiragana and katakana when the context is complicated.) However, it is true that we cannot stop this trend of using modern items so what we have to do is to place more emphasis on education of writing kanji in the elementary school. The problem of lacking the ability to write is not only unique problem to Japan. We can say the same thing to children in USA or Britain as well. Because many of the students use short cut messages when emailing to friends, many of the students are forgetting the proper spelling of words. Anyway, as I have said before, we cannot stop this trend of using modern technology but we can concentrate more on writing skills at school, and maybe schools need to teach their students about risks of using modern technology as well."
461,"I deplore giving the damage to cultural heritage. To reduce defacement such an incident, I think not only security should be reinforced but also should execute felony."
462,"When I read this article, I was surprised that prison has to face terms of up to two years and fine of nearly 2 million yen when he or she downloaded illegal music or files from the Internet. At first, this punishment is too heavy for this crime. This crime is easily to occur because we use the Internet often, and I think illegal music or files are cheaper than real ones. So, many people use this sites without understanding a law. In order to prevent this crime, this punishment is very effective and I think this law helps people who download illegal music or files from the Internet. We should use computers more carefully."
463,"We have to think seriously that problem. Writing kanji is one of Japanese culture, so losing skills of writing kanji means losing a part of our culture. I think children should practice writing kanji more, and I agree with the opinion that we must consider how children should be taught to use computers, the agency said. From the view of communication skill, children don't have to use computers so much. Communicate with others by using letter namely by writing kanji by hand may help children to establish good human relations."
464,"I agree with this new law. Downloading 'pirates' is equal to betray the musician. If you like the music, you have to answer to the musician namely pay collect consideration. I wish this law works well and decrease 'pirates'."
465,"It is a grave problem for Japanese people to forget writing enough numbers of kanji.If Japanese people can't use kanji ,they will make it difficult to live by Japanese language.Thanks to kanji, we can read Japanese sentences more clearly. But I also think Japanese students should not cut down the time to learn the skill of computers because of this 'kanji' problem.The abilities to use computers are essential for the students to live in the future in this world. How to balance between calligraphy lesson and computer learning is the problem for us to think about."
466,"I think that Japanese people are losing the ability to write kanji certainly. But i also think that it is not very important thing. At present, we use e-mail. But in early time, when people are at another place, if they would like to communicate with each other, the way of communicating is only writing a letter. So Japanese people are accustomed to writing kanji. However, when we use e-mail to communicate with other people and type kanji by cell phone, cell phone in itself can transform letter into kanji. So even if people know just vague kanji's figure, they can type the kanji because they remember it's figure. In this article, it is very important problem in the society. But I don't think so. This is because who can have the skill of writing all kanji? Who also can remember the order of writing kanji? It is said that this order is important. But maybe, most of people don't know it just like kanji learning at the elementary school. And also when people transform letter into kanji by cell phone, they have to know the kanji's meaning. If they know the meaning, it isn't mattter in the society because they can understand this sentence. I think that the problem in the society is that they cannot understand the kanji in itself. The root of the cause is Japanese education system. So we have to make effort to solve the problem not blaming e-mail."
467,"I think kanji is one of the most important Japanese culture. Therefore, losing Japanese' ability to write kanji is serious problem. I like Japanese language because of its warmth, which is due to kanji. But I also feel I am losing ability of writing it. Nowadays, Japanese students study both computer skills and writing kanji. But I think kanji writing is treated lightly. Leaving as it is will bring about break down of Japanese traditional culture. We must rethink how important kanji is for our culture."
468,"I think this law is very effective in protecting Japanese music piracy and I also expect Japanese music industry will develop by boosting sales of CDs and digital items. Besides, I suggest Japanese music should be appreciated on Internet, for example, on YouTube. In fact, South Korean music company opens their musics and promotion videos and it causes great impact of advertising and sales actually. Moreover, this idea connects to decrease of illegal download of music, I think."
469,"In my case, I heartily felt that I forget kanji now when I am in Japan more than when I study in abroad. I used to write on note when I practice Japanese words. However, after I started living in Japan, I realized that memorize kanji is not that important to live in japan. Of course kanji is vital when student take term examination however, when I communicate, or writing reports, iphone and computer assist me to change hiragana to kanji automatically. For this reason, I firmly assert that teaching child with computers is not appropriate. I think children have to learn their languages with their own hands. It is inevitable to write a report with a computer when they grow up so, at least they have to be accustomed to write kanji when they are young."
470,"This is difficult problem. This problem come from Internet anonymity. In short,this is related the copyright of music companies and the privacy of people. That is necessary to correspond carefully to this."
471,"I hope that the Tate Gallery will remedy that painting as soon as possible. It must be very sad incident for Rothko and his Family. He may be crying in heaven. By the way, in order to prevent such a tragedy from now on, the gallery have to strengthen its security and at the same time, the criminals have to be strictly punished, as ID1244 said."
472,"There are some people who say that forgetting kanji is not really a big problem but I totally disagree this idea. It's true that writing skills of kanji is not necessary in our normal everyday lives....since we use iphones and computers to have contact with each other. However, thinking about that we were all born in Japan and how important it is to protect our culture, I can't help saying that lost of our writing kanji skills is such a disappointing thing. I believe we should be able to write kanji as long as it is our old, and wonderful culture."
473,"I agree with the idea that the person who downloaded the music illegally should be punished. But actually, maybe it is really difficult problem. As the technology, specially related to the Internet, is developing day by day, it is not easy to prevent such a crime , I guess."
474,"Actually, I think the issue is not so big a problem. I guess we cannot go against the current of the times which is trying to deal all the things by using computers. In that way, we cannot help losing the ability to write the kanji. Of course I feel a bit sad 'cause we're gonna lose a part of Japanese traditional culture. But think about the past! Could we preserve all the traditional culture? Never. So maybe we need to compromise with the matter, and let us get a better life by using lots of convenient tools."
475,"I think it is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged and they need to be fixed as soon as possible. Not only me but also many people all over the world are feeling the same way, I guess."
476,"I am poor at writing Kanji. Because I don't have a lot of times when I write Kanji. I use a smart phone and a personal computer. So I don't have to write Kanji. But I think that we should be good at writing Kanji. Because Kanji is a system made by ancient. Kanji is also beautiful and cool. And writing Kanji beautiful is a skill needed by Japanese society. I can't write words correctly and beautifully. So I respect people who can write words correctly and beautifully. In elementary school, teachers should teach more about Kanji. By the way, I want to get pre1 grade of kanji skill."
477,"I got angry with this news. I thought the culprit wanted to be famous in the society by doing such a thing, but I can't understand why he thought so. It's just a mad way. I can't forgive him. Anyway, i hope the Gallery will do the best to recover it."
478,"I cannot believe the action which the idiot man has made. What on earth did he do? What made him do such a thing? Public assets are, as everyone including small child know, the things for all the people. I hope such a shocking incident won't happen again. And the appropriate measurement is needed. It's an urgent matter."
479,"I think that Tate Gallery should remedy that painting immediately. And I also think we should think and carry out the measures in order to prevent the incident like this. So, It connects with prevention of the incident like this."
480,I think that administration should be strengthen to the museum. Past work of art is so beautiful and high values. So we must leave past work of art in the future. I hope so.
481,"I think that painting gallery especially cultural heritages are not permissible.In order to prevent such actions, it is very important for us to improve the security toward many acts."
482,"Now all the Tate Modern can do is restoring the painting that was defaced by a vandalism, I think. I believe that it was bad defences for paintings in the gallery. Besides the gallery has to build up glasses and walls so that we protect other paintings and artistic things. It is because they are legacies for the future people and the world's fortunes. The gallery must protect other artistic things."
483,"I oppose to deface the art works from two reasons. First, the art is very important for the artist and owner. They must feel sad to hear that. So we have to distinguish good from evil in common sense of morality, I think. Second, many arts are valuable and healing for us because they make our life wealthy. I went to Bridgestone museum in Tokyo in these days, I really enjoyed appreciating the exhibit there. The experience gave me many knowledge and ideas of life. We must love the works and treat them very carefully."
484,"I think illegal downloading should be regulated. But the punishment, facing prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen, is too far. And I think it is difficult to regulate illegally downloading. Nowadays, cybercrimes are increasing rapidly, and most of them are left as it is because of difficulty of arresting, due to the amount and anonymity of Internet. I am wondering if this law fulfill its function."
485,The illegal downloads is popular among people. Because illegal downloads is cheap and easy to do and familiar. But many companies were damaged by illegal downloads. So illegal downloads must be banned by laws. A lot of people download illegally. So the law may not work good. I think it is big news.
486,"I can't understand what's called 'vandalism'. People have different values and often it's difficult to experience empathy with values completely different from oneself. Even so, we can at least recognize that there are various values around us; nevertheless, go so far as attack on works of art should be irrational. To be sure, works of art sometimes strongly reflect political or regional ideology. Considering there are also people just enjoy 'art', however, whatever political or other intentions vandal may have, they should not damage works of art."
487,"I strongly believe that the vandal is not pardoned. If he would like to send a message to other people and want to leave the message, he would be able to send and leave the message by the other way. For example he run the painting in the his account on SNS. We have the right to freedom expression. But we use the right as long as we go against the public welfare. It is natural that we must not deface other people's thing. According to the other article, he would like to make the painting famous and want many many people to look at the painting. But due to his behavior, the painting cannot be exhibited for the remedy of the damage. So he should take the responsibility of the vandalism and he should think over the way of conveying his feeling."
488,"I disagree with the new Japanese law. firstly, we don't know the range that if we download music and films, we are arrested. It is much vague. Do we are arrested only to download YouTube? There are a lot of way of downloading. We don't understand whether the site is legal or illegal when we download something. If so, we have to download as we fear the behavior. Secondly, is it truth that due to illegally download, music and film industry suffer a serious damage? For example, in Switzerland, government permitted the illegally download as legal download. Its government paid attention to the surplus in domestic economy. the surplus is that the money that be left over even if ordinarily people live a common life. now, the world is falling into recession. simply, people cannot use money for entertainment because people have less money than before. But according to the government's survey, we turned out to use the surplus for another place or this industry. In other words, it is irrelevant to downloading illegally. there are many ways of earn a money in this industry such as holding a concert or planning another event.this industry try to return to the way of earn a money by selling CD or DVD. But it takes a mistake.The time is changing and changing day by day. Government don't have to protect the industry that would like to protect existing interest and have the negligence of endeavour to getting money.I think that this industry should investigate the action of consumer and make efforts to correspond to the action."
489,"I was surprised that the famous painting defaced by a man. I knew the different news that one lady changed a famous painting in order to fix it because of old. I couldn't understand why he defaced that painting. Famous paintings should be seen by many people in the world, and people should feel what is the real beauty from paintings. Tate Gallery should put watchmen in front of paintings and they should prevent these accident again."
490,"Of course, a man who defaced painting(mural) deserves to be infamous, I think the Tate gallery also has a problem. Galleries should prepare for any incident however, The incident occurred in the Tate gallery showed the weakness of secure of the Tate gallery. In my opinion, The Tate gallery should pay damage to the artist's family also, the gallery have a responsibility to restore paintings employing professionals."
491,The strange accident is just funny for people who don't interest in art like me. However artists may be angry when they hear the news. I think painting should be liberty but painting is also his or her works and mass of theirs. Vandalism forget it i think.
492,"Since I deeply love Kanji personally, and this is one of the important culture of Japan, this was very sad news for me. However, with transliteration function of computers or cellphones, we can make sentences with correct Kanjis. So, ultimately, what we need to have is ability of reading Kanji, not of writing kanji. Therefore, I think this will be less and less important issue as the technology replaces with handwriting."
493,"I agree with the new Japanese law to ban the people who illegally download music or films. As the Korean case shows, it will probably work in Japan to some extent as well. There is no denying that it is difficult to restrict all the pirates but it will become a deterrence to a lot of people in Japan. But the problem is that this problem is severe as a globe and the truth is that illegal downloading cannot be solved only in Japan. Even if Japan makes some contribution to this problem, other democratic countries such as USA and Canada, for example, emphasis so heavily on the freedom and privacy that without the cooperation of the global world, it is difficult to completely solve this problem. Also, you can download from China, the country which has many illegally downloading pirates, and Chinese people can download from Japan which means this problems is complicatedly interrelating. So in order to stop illegal downloading, there need some kind of international conferences being held and make agreement or, if possible, use international criminal court.( I know what I am saying is idealistic.) And we also have to think about freedom and privacy in this problem so it is really complicated. Anyway, this Act will surely work in Japan to a certain degree so I hope the music and film industry to receive more money, and I hope they will make high quality music and films!"
494,"I am not really interested in arts but I strongly believe what vandal did was morally wrong. Whatever he thinks, we cannot justify damaging other people's works. If we allow what he did, it means that we are going to justify damaging other people's stuff, no matter we dislike or not. He must have been taught at school that he is not allowed to damage others. It is just the same thing. Whatever reason he had, it is morally wrong. Also, in this case, he had alternative way to express his thought. He could have used Twitter or Facebook or whatever. He should better take a good, hard look at himself and apologize to painter's family members about his act. I hope the mural will be repaired as it was and I will expect the museum to protect arts from next time."
495,"Everyone, of course, knows that they must not damage the belongings of others, as defacing other's paintings. The vandal is unforgiven. I want to understand what drove him to act the vandalism."
496,"I wonder why the suspect could fled outside in only a few minutes. I guess the museum didn't have enough number of guards to protect arts and it relied on people's moral. But that's what can't be helped. Generally museums have so many exhibits and it may be difficult for them to hire a lot of guards. I also wander why he defaced the painting before other visitors' eyes. It's unusual and seems that he acted on impulse or purpose. Seeing that the latest news article reports he was a big fan of the artist, his motive for the crime may be similar to the latter. He might want to show his preference to the painting by putting a message on it. Anyway, his selfish act against moral and law ruined the precious painting. He will be punished."
497,"I was sorry when I heard this news. I often go to museums. I think the things people left like works of art, buildings, literary works and so on are legacies of human beings. I do not know the destroyer's mind when he defaced the art. If such person appears much more, museums will strengthen the secure. Then, I think our visit become boring. So, I think conservation of heritages should depend on people's conscience."
498,"I think the order of kanji strokes are something very important when writing by hand. The balance and the appearance of the kanji differs when we don't use the proper order. On the other hand when we write kanji in proper order the kanji looks beautiful. Japanese people are often particular about this appearance. Also, Kanji is ancient and very important Japanese culture. We should be proud of kanji and we also should respect and protect our culture.. I myself am not against the use of mails and new technology but I do not want to lose important Japanese culture so I will try hard not to forget easily."
499,"I agree with ID1242.The art objects should be protected strictly.Because they can not be restored again.They can tell us the ancient desire and feelings. We have to keep these things for the future.Needless to say, the gallery needs to strengthen the security right now. And, all visitors have to respect for these arts.I think that this is the most basic and necessary rule of the gallery."
500,Many people download movies or music illegally. They know it is illegal but many people do that so they might feel like it is okay. So we need some solutions to reform their conscience fundamentally besides the law.
501,The art museum need more strict guard for valuable pictures. I don't understand why he damaged the picture . It should not be forgiven.
502,"I agree with ID1242's comment. I want the gallery remedy the painting. The event was not good thing to Rothko and people who like the painting of Rothko. Because of the event, I think that the gallery should make staff to stand in front of the paintings to protect them. I hope those events will not happen again."
503,"I agree with ID1231 about 'Vandalism.' It's impossible to tell and share how one feel to others. The guy who did this might feel this art is rubbish. Like other people ave commented, I wish Tate Gallery will remedy the painting as much as possible. Also, I think other gallery should think about how their security should be, and how they could change it to protect art."
504,Not only Tate Modern but other art museums would have to think of a countermeasure to these problems. I can't understand why he did such a thing but I hope there are no other accidents like this.
505,"I think Kanji is one of the precious Japanese culture so it is a shock to hear that some people are saying that not being to write Kanji is not a big problem. Kanji makes you read easier and from the Kanji been used, people understand what the writer is trying to say.Kanji is a politeness for the reader and it is very important."
506,"I think this new law will not work because the Internet is infinite world. So, they cannot exterminate all illegal downloads. Now, people buy few CDs. I think this is a trend. The music industry should think a new way to earn. I think the music industry need not be particular about selling CDs. There are a lot of TV programs about music in Japan. And, almost musicians do a live concert. I think a music industry make the best of a job except a selling CDs field."
507,"I regret that the painting was defeated. Artworks must be protected by everything because they are fortunes their own. The museum should be strengthen securities. For example, they increase the number of guards."
508,"I think this case is rare. I don't know why the vandal defaced the painting. It is not good to deface art works, whatever the reason is. Art works is not for one but for everyone."
509,"The person who download the music or the movie illegally are should be punished, but it is very difficult problem. Now, many people use the Internet and watch the YouTube free of charge. It is natural for us to listen to the music or watch the movies on the Internet. At present situation, a number of people have the possibilities of being the criminals, and managing them is extremely hard work. So I think it is necessary for us to have guilty conscience."
510,"I think that EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. It is too early. It is the truth that EU was established for keeping out any wars and this purpose has been fulfilled for 60 years. However we must not forget that EU also holds some countries which suffer for the financial crisis. In fact, we can see a lot of demonstrators in these countries. EU should strive to solve this issue before being awarded the Prize, or peace in EU will not be kept for a long time."
511,"I can not understand what for the vandal did such a thing, and what made him do so. He has a right to think anything, but doesn't have it to trouble somebody. I hope the accident like this won't happen again, and the museum should improve the security."
512,"Though I'm not familiar with arts, I think what the vandal did must not be permitted. Of course the gallery will remedy the condition, but it will not be restored to its former state. I wonder whether the gallery secured works fully. I think that security of works is one of the most important tasks of galleries."
513,"As our society is being more and more convenient, we become to live easily. However, in accord with it, we are losing important abilities. The ability to write 'Kanji' is one of examples of them. If we have some trouble in writing words, we would forget how to write characters. This is undesirable situation for passing Japanese cultures to the next generation."
514,"I think 'losing kanji' is a natural thing. Language reflects society. Many linguists argue that languages change if society changes. There was a lot of changing in languages until now. We can find examples of language alternation easily in history. And also, a famous Korean writer mentioned that language is a creature in his book. I think this is a good sentence to explain the character of the language that changes by circumstance. And because of the internet and technology, alternation in language is more obvious in these days. For example, there is a dictionary for new words because lots of new words generated every day. I think 'losing kanji' is kind of this alteration. According to this logic, I argue 'losing kanji' is a natural thing. Kanji is uncomfortable when it comes to using a keyboard. Katakana is used instead of kanji often on the internet. Even though these kinds of alterations occur frequently, I don't think only technology made kanji dissolve. There are two alterations in Japanese kanji due to technology. One is a losing kanji and the other is the restoration of complicated kanji. For example, 慶應was usually written as 慶応in early days because 應is too complicated. But even though it is difficult to remember, people can write easily with a keyboard. Because of this, I argue that technology is not harmful for learning kanji."
515,"I think this incident is so terrible. Someone who defaced this art do this crime just for fan. But,he must not such a vicious joke. I can't understand Mark Rothko's art. However, so many people who love Rothko's art must be sad."
516,"Writing graffiti is impermissible conduct. There are sorts of them, such as graffiti in public conveniences, temples, and walls of houses. And weight of these crimes is different. I guess that those who write graffiti in temples or famous paintings want to be recognized his/her existence and self-display, or want to get a thrill from their actions. I don't know the psychology of the criminal of this case. However if we have frustrations and aggressiveness, we should restrain them. In the final count, these actions are strictly regulated by law."
517,"I prefer to download and listen music illegally since it needs no money. However, in a seller's case, downloading intellectual property illegally can be a crime due to their livelihood. Therefore, intellectual property have to be protected from spreading illegally. Of course setting a law for this problem is important but the most important thing is the point that people have to realize downloading contents for free is a wrongdoing, we have to obtain other people's intellectual property by giving them proper value."
518,"I was sad to hear this story. It is said that the work is the part of himself for artist, so the culprit is very terrible. Recently, the graffiti on the World Heritage or wounded corals are saw and took up as problem, I think increasing people who can't think the beauty is beautiful is very sad and big problem for the next generation."
519,"Increasing the illegal download is damaging the music business world and the national economy. From the one point of views, the many music are healing many people by illegal downloads or YouTube. So I think its problem is just going around in circles."
520,I think the award is just joke because EU caused depressions from Greece and it leads the world to bad world. I think America and Japan also keep the peace. I agree eurosceptics.
521,"I disagree with the Nobel peace prize's winner of this year. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be admitted to be peaceful by people all over the world. But this case, people even in the EU criticizes about the prize, such as eurosceptics. Moreover the word of 'peace' ought to have the only one meaning, so I believe these wide way of thinking about recipient is wrong."
522,"I think Nobel Prize should be sent to individuals rather than organization. Sometimes many people contribute to common feat together and it's hard to decide who is the best and deserved. As a result, an organization not an individual is awarded. But this decision may not do good to both those who were involved in the feat and the idea of Nobel Prize itself. Firstly, individuals' achievements were hidden by too broad and vague achievement of an organization. For instance, EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace is made up of many individuals' achievements such as breaking the dictatorship. Even if EU awards the Nobel Prize, they cannot attract people's attention. Their feats may not be revealed to people in the world. On the contrary, If a individual awards the Nobel Prize, at least one of their achievements is in the spotlight. Secondary, some organizations utilize Nobel Prize as a propaganda to boost their confidence. Policy of a country is one of the most polarizing issues and many people may not agree to the award. In reality, some praise the EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace while other criticize it even in the member of the EU. And in such a situation, the organizations are only self-satisfied with the award. So I believe Nobel Prize should go to only individuals."
523,"I was surprised to see that around nine in 10 downloads in Japan are illegally purchased. Honestly I downloaded some songs and movies from illegally up-loaded websites before. I think the new law is necessary. Online piracy kills motivation of creation, and causes the surroundings to suppress creating new works. To wipe it out, I also think, officials need to offer opportunities for us to learn and understand fully importance of literary property."
524,"I think forgetting Kanji is caused by increasing of using electronic things such as mobile phone, iPad and PC. One of my friend is using iPad to copy what teacher write on board. Now, young people don't communicate by hand writing. They mostly use mobile phone and internet therefore, they don't need to remember how to write Kanji. It will be big problem in future i guess."
525,"Like other people said, I think EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. They were given the prize because they had no war for 60 years, but I think there are other countries where they don't have war for longer than 60 years. Also, like some people mentioned, EU is the one who lead Economic Crisis. There were lot of demos toward government. I'm not so sure that leading Economic Crisis and Demos are 'Peace.' Also, some people said that Prize should be given to independent, but I think organization also have right to earn the Prize."
526,"I don't think EU deserves Novel Peace Prize. Though it's admirable that EU had no war for 60 years, we should not say that only such a thing is required for Peace. Because of the recent world wide depression, many people and countries are suffering from financial problem. European countries are some of the most struggling countries in the world. Due to this problem, it's easily assumable that people are loosing their jobs. How can we call that such countries peaceful?"
527,"I agree with ID1242's comment. I do not think that EU deserves the prize. The prize was given because European countries had no war for 60 years, but I think it is strange because we must not cause a war any more. Therefore, it does not matter whether 60 years have passed. We do not care about that how many years we live without war. We just need to think about not causing a war again."
528,I don't think that EU deserves to win the Novel Peace Prize because 60 years of peace in Europe is not special. WWⅡdamaged Europe seriously.Therefore EU didn't have plenty of energy left over for starting new war.
529,"As other people had said, I don't think EU suits to Novel Peace Prize.Keeping out war is a thing that must be done everywhere around the world and it is not a special thing.There are still many problems are happening in Europe countries and they have to correspond to these problems."
530,"I think this is not worthy to recognize. I agree the Nobel Peace Prize only go to individuals. This recognition look like a performance of politics. And, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should only go to individuals because the Nobel Peace Prize go to a person who contributes to the peace of the world. If the frame of government receive the prize, this means criticizing the others. And, this will connect a thought which winner is always right."
531,"Shameful talk, I didn't know that EU have won the Nobel Peace Prize. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should not only go to individuals but also to organization and so on, because Peace can be protected by everyone. So it's difficult to won the Nobel Peace Prize, but I want to do something for world peace."
532,"Some critics say the reason why EU got the award of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize is that it will encourage European countries to tackle with the difficulties they are facing now, such as economic crisis. There's no denying that it is a good thing to encourage individuals or organizations to strive hard, but is there any justification for the Nobel Peace Prize to do so? I don't think so. Nobel Peace Prize should be separate from the political or economical matter happening in the country or in the world. They should focus only on whether the deed of the actor is appropriate for being commended. Using this argument, I also disagree with when President Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize in the matter of contribution to the peace of Afghanistan. He hasn't really done anything to the peace of Afghanistan ( some say he made Afghanistan more dangerous place) and at this time the prize was awarded just as an encouragement as well. So what I would like to say is that I certainly agree with the fact that some EU countries have contributed to settle down some of the conflicts they had, it was just an outcome of the history, and there's no justification and it is unfair for EU to achieve the prize because while individual or NGO activists routinely make sacrifices and take huge risks to do make the peaceful world, EU are paid to do so."
533,"I am not an European, but Japanese, therefore I do not understand what affairs EU is now confronted with, and what it has really brought Europe. I have so poor knowledge that I am not able to express my opinion about this issue. I have to learn more about it. Anyway I do not care whether Novel Peace Prize should go to such institutions as EU, or individuals. As Mario Monti says, the prize, I hope, will encourage EU to overcome the current economic difficulties."
534,"I think this is very terrible incident, this news made me sad. I can't understand why men who are vandal do destroy the cultural things. I wonder they didn't the feelings of artist or those who protects the works. We have to have a consciousness that we have responsibility of protecting cultural things or paintings and so on, these are the crystal of human talent. I wish all of people love the culture."
535,"I like EU, so I was happy when I was heard the news EU got the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, I can understand some critics against this incident, but you can't deny the role of EU for peace in Europe. The cooperation between many countries, as EU has done, is very important for achieving the international peace, I think. What EU did is precious the 'history'. We have to learn them, both good things and bad things."
536,"In the first place, the Nobel Prize is awarded to the best of contributor in the each field. In other words, this prize is awarded to the person. Novel thought that this prize should be awarded regardless of countries and nations. But is this winning prize against Nobel's will? So I think that the Nobel Prize is awarded to the person not to the organization. Furthermore, I have some doubts about this winning the prize. One of the doubts is the reason why EU is awarded the Nobel Prize. The reason why the EU is awarded is that, as the article written, the EU in recognition of 60 years without war and for encouraging EU governments and people to press forward, 'overcoming the current economic difficulties.' But it is strange. Firstly, most of democratic countries haven't made wars since WWⅡ. EU side will talk about the relationship between France and Germany especially. But there were tense situation between countries such as Japan and China. Both countries also haven't gone to war. Secondly, winning the prize is strange for only overcoming the economic crisis. First of all, economy is not related to the Piece. And also there were a lot of countries which are facing the crisis. This award is against Nobel's will that should not support a part of countries. For these reasons I disagree with this award."
537,"I don't think that EU deserved Nobel Peace Prize. The reason of that is, no matter what people say, the present economic depressions. And I think EU's idea of integration is great, of course, but I don't think just the idea have worth of the prize. Not only that, this reception would let the value of the prize down and make me think that it is a desperate election. Sometimes, there were the years of no recipient of the prize. Causing these problems, I think not electing was better than electing forcibly."
538,"I agree that the EU was given the novel prize. It is because there are still some wars all over the world, these days the number of the wars have been reducing, though. Many classmates disagree with this news, but I do not think so. Anything that keep a peace should be praised. I believe that the peace of the whole world is the most important thing that every people should hope. In short, the novel organization should give the novel peace prize to a lot of plans, organizations, and association."
539,"I disagree with the novel peace prize of this year. Surely it is wonderful to keep being without war for 60 years. However it is a part of the EU.The EU also have bad aspects, for example economic crisis. Moreover the novel prize should be given to only individuals, because prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics."
540,"I do not disagree with the fact that EU has awarded the Nobel peace prize of 2012. Some says it is not appropriate to give such a prize to the organization, but why? I think there is no doubt that the EU has contributed to keep the peace of the European continent. Think about the past! There had been wars in every generations! But, now? no more war. Is there any doubt that it has not contributed to achieve such a great thing?"
541,"I think vandalism is a very serious crime. Works of art are things we inherit from previous generations, and we must hand those down to the next generation. If someone hurt works like this incident, those pieces of art can no longer be left to the next generation. I think each person must recognize their roles, and we should protect them."
542,"I am against this new law. Many people are not aware that illegal downloading is illegal. Also, because of the boundless number of illegal downloads, punishing them does not make the matter better. I think that we should focus on strengthening the security of things that relate with copyright like music and movies before we make a law like this."
543,"I strongly object to the sentence of six Italian seismologists. It's true they failed to predict the large earthquake and some of people acted on the false information that they gave. However, a-six year prison and $17.7million fine are too excessive. It's impossible for today's scientific technology to forecast natural disaster completely, especially earthquake or eruption. Usually, scientific techniques are testified so many times in order to ensure the safety and improve the accuracy. But large earthquake and eruption rarely occur and that means there a fewer chance to testify the techniques. So it's too severe punishing the scientists just because they failed to predict the earthquake. Furthermore, heavy penalties for false prediction can give bad effect on development of science. If some judges take a similar line, scientists are allowed to speak only collect things. Then scientists become likely to refrain from predicting unknowns for fear of being punished. Also young people avoid entering such area of science and consequently the number of researchers will decrease. So, severe penalties for false prediction can be blow to the growth of branches of science exploring unknowns. I hope the seismologists will turn out to be innocent and the scientific freedom will be ensured."
544,"I think that the sentencing of six Italian seismologists should not be permitted. There are two reasons. First, scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. The evidence of it is 'freedom of expression'. All the people must have 'human rights' that we have gained and possessed historically. Second, science has a possibility of developing our life. If some scientists who make a mistake by chance are punished, it must weaken their strong desires to study. That means our life quality will go down. So I think people who receive the the result of scientific research should be more carefully."
545,"It is improper that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Earthquakes are natural phenomenon, so it is difficult to predict it. The other seismologists fare that predicting earthquakes. We should protect our selves without the other people' s help. Anyway, when a earthquake occurs, we must act quickly."
546,"According to this article, six seismologists were sentenced six years in jail and ordered to pay more than nine million euros ($11.7 million). This is too strict for them I think. Science are changing and developing every each day. All scientists have rights to study and research new technology and this is scientific freedom. Not only the case of science but also other subjects, this right of freedom is existed. Italy should rethinks about this problem and also possibility of scientific field."
547,"This news shocked me very much. The prediction of an earthquake, when to happen and how strong it will be, is not absolute. Therefore the scientists should not be blame for it. As Michael Halpern emphasizes, scientists need to, or have to announce what they know without feeling fear of being charged if their knowledge is not right. I think, in general when a disaster happens, people are apt to make it clear who is responsible for it, and accuse them of it. As a case in point, in Japan, when 3.11 earthquakes occurred, the public and media criticized Tokyo-Electric Power Company and governments, as if they had caused all the disaster including the earthquake."
548,"I think that it is not good to pronounce scientists to prison sentences.Because it is natural for them to explore unknowns.If they are targeted by the verdict,they will search for many things which we do not know.I regard this situations as depriving the right to speak freely and independently.Provided this conditions are going to continue,I think that big epoch-making results will appear for a long time,so this time' ridiculous judgement should reconsider at once."
549,"The development of our technology is most likely the reason why young people are losing their ability to write Kanji in recent years. As Gento said above, we, young people do not take note by hand writing. My friends around me bring their laptops to school and type what is on the board, and they sometimes take a picture of it with a camera of smartphones. To solve the problem, I think reading books would be efficient way."
550,"I used to downloading free mp3 musics and movies. Now, I am very afraid that the downloading those kind of things officially have been illegal and, at the same time, surprised that we possibly receive the letters from government and get warned. But, I think it is still hard to restrict people all over the world to illegal download."
551,"Paintings are not capable of being duplicated. It is the only one. The same paintings never exist. I wonder why the suspect has conducted such a terrible thing, but also I do not understand why the vandalism was easily conducted. Therefore, I think the security of the museum should be more stiff."
552,"I agree with the Nobel peace prize for EU. I think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize. EU accomplish its purpose properly. I expect that this prize will make a sense of unity stronger, and function to improve the economic crises."
553,"I think this collision is being come by the absence of standard of prizing Nobel Peace Prize. Actually, it is hard to establish a standard of Peace Prize. Because Peace can be thought as both comprehensive and microscopic. However, in my personal opinion, I think the Nobel Peace Prize have to be prized by a standard based on microscopic viewpoint. Nobody would be awarded if presenting the Peace Prize based on comprehensive since there are no people who had not made a fault in their lives. Therefore, EU deserved to prize the Nobel Peace Prize."
554,"I think six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. Because it considers a man-made disaster. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information."
555,"I think these scientists should be discharged. No matter how better the technology improve, human beings can't manipulate nature. Therefore, though scientists expect disasters, it is nonsense that the government put the blame on them. Not only that, this will cause depressions of science. I hope that the judgement will be overturned and they will keep on their studies."
556,I was very surprised at this news. It is impossible for human to predict a earthquake correctly. So six scientists have no responsible. Such a thing won't cause good correspond. Italian should face this thing seriously..
557,"It is ridiculous to sentence scientists due to a mispredict of natural phenomena. They have a responsibility to evacuate people from a danger area even when they predict little chances of danger. Scientists will blamed by people even if they do not evacuate people since people will be disappointed with scientist's decision. This collision makes scientists to be in a dilemma. However, citizen's security is the most important thing to be protected. Therefore, scientists could not be blamed."
558,"I strongly believe that to sentence the seismologists in jail and to fine them are too heavy punishment. It is true that the seismologists are to be blamed for their statements because they are the one of the only ones who can scientifically analyze or make a caution about the earthquake ( People are less likely to have knowledge about future earthquake). However, sentencing them in jail and fining them cannot be justified in terms of the right of freedom of expression. Everyone has the right to speak freely in public ( I don't include hate speech in this case) and without the right to speak freely and independently, the both sides, scientists and moderate people or people in public, would turn into chaos. In scientists case, for example, any new innovation such as more precise prediction of earthquake or weather forecasting or research into new drugs etc will be pushed off, which means that we cannot make any invention. In public case, for example, without having opportunity to gain new information about natural disaster, even it is difficult to predict or not, people will lack in information, and in extreme case, democracy which is assuring the freedom of expression will be infringed and will collapse. So considering from these arguments, I strongly oppose to the court."
559,"Probably, Italy is going to secure the academic freedom. Most of countries, especially developed countries, secure academic freedom. Academic freedom is that any scholars, specialists can express and publish their research freely. Of course, there is asymmetry of information for science between scientist and ordinary people. But just because they have a lot of scientific knowledge it doesn't follow that they are prosecuted even if they publish the wrong opinion. They have great influence on their society. But their opinions are 'one opinion'. They also have a mistake. This is because they are not omniscient and omnipotent. As long as Italy protects academic freedom, scholars and specialists don't have to be sentenced. Secondly, the seismologists were sentenced by published that the earthquake does not happen. However, the announcement was published as the government's view. Why do the only seismologists have to take liability of the announcement? If they were prosecuted by the announcement, the government also should take responsibility of publishing the wrong opinion. The government just replaced the miss with the seismologists. So the government should apologize to the citizen for this case."
560,"I agree that those who possess illegally downloaded music or films in Japan will face prison terms of up to two years and fines of nearly 2 million yen. Nowadays, the sales of CD have been decreasing for several years in addition to the withdrawal of HMV, which is the biggest and most popular CD shop. However, the introduction of this new act makes the sales of CD increase in the future. Besides, every Internet user should comply the copyright act, I have downloaded music illegally though. But at that time, I was not sure that I was committing the crime. Most of infringers do not realize their piracy like me. So the government should admonish the whole nation about what is crime."
561,"In my perspective, I disagree that scientists who misjudge the risk of an earthquake will be sentenced. It is because if scientists do not have the right to speak what they research freely and independently, they cannot share what they examine in addition to becoming meaningless of the research. Then that will prevent and decrease the progress of science. Besides, no one can predict when an earthquake would happen in the future, as the article said. In short, the scientists may be not guilty. In addition, Italy should concern how to recover the damage and treat the victims rather than the punishment of the scientists. It is because the most important thing for a democracy country is the nation. Besides, the scientists are probably innocent. However, Italy said that the scientists should be sentenced. I wonder what is 'little risk of damage' that is in this news though. Obviously, this quake is very big; not little risk of damage. But if 50 people died of a quake, is that a big risk or little risk? And who decides whether a quake is little risk or not? The borderline between little or not is pretty vague; different people. So, scientists should not be sentenced."
562,It is impossible for me to understand the Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in jail for underestimating the risk of a 2009 earthquake. It is natural that scientist's expectation often prove wrong. I think that is Science.
563,"Like other people said, I also disagree with 6 year sentence and $11.7million fine to Italian scientist and government official. Our technology is not developed enough to completely predict what would happen in future, especially if that is environmental disaster. The government should always be ready for such disaster, and it's not right to sentence these six people. I wonder if these scientists predict there will be big disaster in near future, could government be prepared for that. For example, in Japan, scientist warned that there will be big earthquake. However, Japanese government didn't prepare for such disaster and caused lot of problem after 3.11."
564,"It will not be possible that science can predict perfectly every natural disaster. It's just some opinions what scientists say, and it's depend on each person what they believe. I had thought like that. However, through the conversation in the last class, I came to think that we have no choice but to believe what the professionals say if we have no idea about specialist things. And professionals must know that we need their knowledge. Although the punishment of this time may be too hard for them, they have to have responsibility about their statements."
565,"I think that it is impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs, even the seismologists because earthquake is a natural disaster. If people can predict when the natural disaster happens, a great number of people would survive when the huge earthquake happened on 11th of March 2011. It is impossible for them to estimate, so I think it is ridiculous that the seismologists were sentenced to six years in jail. I want them to be released from jail."
566,I do not agree with the verdict that Italian court did. It was a fact that the prediction scientists showed caused great damage. However scientists are very week against the power. The freedom of description is must been protected strictly. So I disagree against the punishment for scientists.
567,"It is the world-shaking event I think. We can't understand technical matters, so we should believe the statement of specialist stuff. But after the matter like this, we don't know to do for our safety and will do wrong treatment. I think specialist stuff should have responsibility about their statement and their technical fields. And investigations should keep the peace and safety of the people."
568,"I think Nobel Peace Prize is given the man who proposed and caught out the idea which has a possibility to make everyone happy. Its aim isn't for everyone, the importance is to make many people happy, and need not any sacrifices. Now, EU can't resolve the problem of poverty, the society which can make a part of people happy is not really happy I think."
569,"I think Obama's re-election is meaningful for both US and Japan. First, for America,I believe that he is responsible for restoring finances because US has to face tax increase by expiration of big reduction of taxes and cutback of revenue early in the new year if any new policy don't carried out. It means American economy falls into serious depression and it influences for many countries all over the world. Next, he have showed friendship to Japan. Japanese government should take advantage of it to solve the territorial dispute with China and South Korea."
570,"Many latest Japanese have lost the capability to write a Kanji.I may not understand a Kanji frequently, either. However, now, it is bad.It is because a Kanji is what has been transmitted from ancient times and it should hand down to future generations. People should become the society which uses a Chinese character more."
571,"There are many people who do not know this law yet. Therefore, I think that arrest is immediate. In order to avoid this, it is more nearly required improvement in net morals and to spread law by media."
572,"I heard this news and felt it shocking. vandalism is a very serious crime.It is because the same fine-arts work is never made. Therefore, I think that this incident is an important problem. In order to prevent the repetition of an offense, the art museum should further keep watch severely."
573,"I guessed Obama would be elected again, and actually it came to realized. It was allegedly said that Obama's triumph was monumental achievement because none had won re-election under high employment rate of above 8% since 1940. But given that there is increasingly population of Latinos who endorse Democrat, it isn't so surprising things. According to this article, 71% of Latinos voted Obama and 50000 Latinos turn 18 and are entitled to vote every month. The figure of 71% indicates that the large number of Latinos advocated him. His social welfare program 'Obama Care' probably attracted them, many of who are in low or middle income group. Also, his tolerant attitude toward illegal immigrants would be benefit for them, many of who are too immigrants or descendants of them. So, it might be natural that Obama won the re-election under such circumstances. Besides, the figures also indicate that Latinos is getting no longer minority in US and Obama is popular among them. The population of Latino voters is on the great increase and it follows that Obama may get more support of Latinos if he can keep his words. His victory might be good for US, but it would be bad for Japan. Usually, Democrats harshly require Japan to share the more costs of the US military base in Japan. Also, US-Japan relationship became weak during his first term. I hope he will put emphasis on the relationship and make every effort to strengthen it.."
574,"I do not think the EU deserves the novel prize as many students complaining above. They said that the EU was kept without war for 60 years. This should be appreciated, but they caused terrible problem at the same time. The depression we are struggling with now is actually caused from one of the countries of the EU. To receive the prize, they should have solved the problem and been perfect."
575,"I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens."
576,I can't support this verdict.I think that this six Italian scientists must be found innocent and acquitted. They only announced their own research and earthquake prediction. They haven't done anything wrong.
577,"I can't understand why EU was awarded Novel Peace Prize. I don't think that EU contributed peace of world. On the contrary, EU confused the world economy by financial crisis. But, I agree organization are awarded Novel Prize. Because, I think many kind of method for peace have to be evaluated."
578,"The presidential election in America is one of the most important events. 4years later, Mr. Obama won this election very easily, but this time, the election became harder than last time. During the campaign of election, the huge hurricane came to NY and the candidates stopped continuing campaign. I think Mr. Obama's correspondence of hurricane led winning of election. However, during 4 years which Mr. Obama was inaugurated as President, he didn't do good policies. I hope Mr.Obama will govern the huge country and the world rather than before."
579,"After hard competition, Mr.Obama eventually won the presidential election again. America gives various effects to Japan. Japan needs America's cooperation in some problems of Asia. So this election is important for Japan, too. What he will do in second term can influence on all over the world. I hope he won't break the goals of his second term which he set out, or he might be not able to won the next election."
581,"I was glad to hear this news. Mr.Obama is supporting TPP, of course, it has the risk to press Japanese agriculture and so on. But it is the most important to fight on the favorite field for Japan, and firstly, we should revive Japanese economy earlier than protect agriculture. I believe his victory will become Japanese victory..."
582,"I welcome Obama's reelection. I was surprised at the fact that Obama is only fourth Democrat to reelect. The American political climate is, I think, considerably different from Japanese. In short, they have much higher interest in politics than Japanese have. That offers the number of $932,013,388, which is the money supporters spent on Obama's campaign, or of $1,028,213,064, which is on Romney's. Public notice of the Election of the House of Representatives in Japan will be provided soon. I will see how exciting it will be, and who will win it."
583,l think Obama's re-election is good news for USA. Mr.Obama has power of improving economy of USA and many problems. I expect him.
584,I think it is not adequate that six Italian seismologists have been punished.Because it is difficult to predict earthquake damage. But I want seismologists to make an effort to analyze earthquake damage.
585,"I think it is unconvinced that EU was awarded Novel Peace Prize.I don't think EU didn't contribute peace of world entirely, but it is abstract and i don't understand how EU contribute."
586,I think it is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged. I guess the value of this wall painting would decrease because of the graffiti. This news was sad for me.
587,I agree this law. Downloading pirates prevents from musicians and film directors getting complete reward. People should get music and movies at the root of the regular.
588,"It is said that Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji' due to emails.I think so too. When I write kanji, I can't remember some kanji. Then I feel the adverse effect of email."
589,"I think it is hard four years for Barack Obama. Obama won and made the boom of 'Yes, we can.' in the previous election. But, he does not have such power now. I think this is good news for Japan. I think Obama does not disregard Japan. But, there is a problem in Japan because Japanese prime minister often change. So, if Obama make a point of relation between Japan and U.S., Japanese government will not arrange a reception. I think this is good news for U.S. too. I heard that Obama's measures against hurricane Sandy was good. I think it is important because measures against hurricane is a matter of life and death. So, I think this is good news for Japan and U.S.."
590,"For the time being I will praise Obama's re-election. Romney had made many gaffes. Even if he had great results, he should be more careful for his remark. Prime minister has great influence on the people even when he says one word. Prime minister also has great responsibility for the people. In that point, Obama is better than Romney. And also I think that we should evaluate his challenge of gay marriage and the policy of immigrant in the election term. Conceding gay marriage was different in the U.S. this is because Christian doesn't admit gay marriage in terms of religion. But Obama decide to give gays the right to marry. It is meaningful for gays that are discriminated. This will be one step that does away with the discrimination. Furthermore, I think that the new policy of immigrate has the meaning. Fundamentally, the U.S. has many races. It is said ''melting pot of races''. Nowadays, the number of Hispanic people is increasing rapidly. Most of them are illegal immigrants. Even though they are illegal immigrants in current system, Obama decide to accept immigrants under some conditions. He could show the tolerance of immigrant to the world. However, there are some doubts for Obama. For example, Obama didn't produce good result in four years. At present, U.S. economy was bad. We cannot see the sign of getting over the recession. Can he really change the situation? Secondly, Obama won the election for the number of electoral colleges. But he lost the number of votes. In other words, he was not supported by ordinary people. It is problematic. Direct election of Prime Minister didn't work out. Under the circumstance, the opinion of the people may be reflected to the policy or bill. For these reasons, Obama must make effort to be trusted by the people."
591,"I think it is important to cooperate with other people to tackle some problems. But once the group became powerful, people in it apt to think their own profit. I don't think that is reasonable. We should be careful being so."
592,First of all I thought I have to read more books because I didn't know the artist. Also I noticed it's good for me to go to museum for cultivate myself.
593,This is bad thing. Because 'kanji' is one of the important Japanese culture. But we cannot stop this trend because of development of modern technology. In this situation I think it's important to practice 'kanji' hard in early stage of our lives.
594,"I think it's natural for Sony and their bond company to be downgraded in its market because their main products don't distinguish for their techniques. Instead of them, other company like Samsung and apple succeeded in many frontier fields such as smart phones or tablet PC. Japanese company should make an effort to develop new products that are attractive to the people all over the world and approach to their customers."
595,"I think writing Kanji is important. The technology has developed dramatically,so we could predict that the opportunity for writing will decrease. Although, to study the order to write it or to memorize it , writing Kanji are necessary.Futhermore, there is a culture of calligraphy in Japan.To protect this, writing is essential."
596,"I agree with this Japanese new law,it is important to regulate it strictly.People are weak with the word of 'free nothing will change by not regulating it strictly. The organization which was damaged by the illegal download, can't certainly said that the situation will improve. I think we need to grope for the solution."
597,"I think this is a horrible news.Of course the person who damaged the picture is blamed mostly,But I think that the way of preserving the art was bad too. Comparing to the Japanese museum, the foreign museum does not treat them neat.I think it is important to reinforce the security."
598,"No war for 60years in Europe is valuable. But I don't know this is worth awarding as a Novel Peace Prize. That because I can't understand the criterion of awarding .I think some people are worth awarding it,but others which I didn't think they had done enough services award it.So I think the value of the Novel Peace Prize is getting less."
599,"To predict the change of nature ,such as earthquake is extremely difficult. So it is not apt to blame scientists. Earthquake is difficult to predict, so we should beware and prepare for it. Furthermore ,we could say that it is important to do an accurate judgement which was not done at the 3.11."
600,"Japanese technical industries are now on the verge of extinction. Once they had big power and their products were popular all over the world. But Those sectors has changed and developed themselves so rapidly that just small strategic mistakes may lead them to death. In addition, ' the third power' such as China, Taiwan and South Korea, appeared large and now is playing an important part of it. In order for Japanese companies to stay longer in the fields, or for their resurrection, they need to find what only Japan can make it."
601,"I guess the reason of Sony's ruin lies in sticking to its old policy. In a period of high economic growth, when there were many young workers and people didn't have much electrical appliance, Sony's TVs and cameras were selling well in Japan. On the other hand, now people are already surrounded by high efficient and durable electrical appliance, and the population of young people, who needs new appliance to start new life, is decreasing. It was natural that Sony couldn't keep its previous profits without creating new main goods. Information technology is developing day by day, and now smart-phones are one of the most selling devices. While foreign competitive companies such as Apple and Samsung entered the market immediately, Sony got behind. It is true that a company have to take risks when entering new market. But Sony should have considered the risk of sticking to the same policy."
602,"To recover Japanese firms for example Sony, Panasonic and so on, I think that there are two improvement points. First,I need to internal reforms.These companies should encourage young employees. Second, these companies are defeated in technology to Samsung and Apple. So they need to new product development."
603,"I want Sony and Panasonic to overcome the situation because these are Japanese companies and they are required to maintain the Japanese economy. Furthermore, the situation causes the employment issue. Young people who want to get a job are not be able to work because of the issue. For that reason, I would like these companies to overcome the situation."
604,"Due to recent economic depression, not only Sony and Panasonic but also almost all companies are suffering from decline of revenue. There are actually some companies which can survive and even grow in this situation, but I guess all of such companies keep coming up with new idea and creating new products which can sell well. Sony and Panasonic have to make new products which can attract consumers enough to compete with Apple or Samsung."
605,"I was very shocked about this news story. Duchess of Cambridge must have been shocked as well. First of all, I couldn't believe the insensitivity of these DJs. The nurses in the hospital must have been busy with the pregnancy of Kate, and it's too rude to dupe people in such a situation. In addition, it was written that one of the DJs boasted what they had done and it's so ridiculous. They might truly apologize as they apprehended the gravity of the situation, but they have to know it's too late. I hope they never repeat the mistake again."
606,"I hope Sony and Panasonic to recover . Although thinking from the real, it is difficult from now. This two companies should not only keep up with the fashion but also look forward . I desire that these company will contribute to Japanese economy."
607,This news was shocking.The action that the DJs done is nonsense and foolish.I hope that they will no do these things again. Of course the DJs are to blame but I think that the nurse didn't need to kill herself.
608,"It is difficult for me how to success the business. But what I could know through reading this news is that to look beyond the trend is very important. Japanese company was not good at looking beyond the trend, so Sony failed. I want them to study from another country's company and get over the present condition."
609,"I agree that we Japanese should seriously grapple with this problem. But, at the same time, children(who are not yet mastered sufficient Japanese) should not be deprived the chances of learning computers. From my experience, as an example, I had been learned how to use computers from 1st grade at elementary school. This, such as information gathering on the Internet, had often made my studying better. And also, owing to limit the time of using computers, I have been fine in using kanji. So, it's important to have a lot of chances to using kanji. The problem is many adults (or workers) depend too much on emails. They should not have enough time to writing kanji as students. It may be good for them to review their degree of dependence on emails."
610,"I agree to this law, because, in fact, music industry troubles due to illegal downloading. However, in practicing this law, we should clearly be informed that which music is legal or not. At present, we can't necessarily tell the difference between them. Avoiding violate the low, new system should be put in place."
611,"As many eurosceptics said, this novel peace prize for EU may exaggerate it's achievements. If the prize winner was an individual, we could see a consistent policy or so. But a big organization as EU, people can't be sure which to focus on it's accomplishments. The Novel committee should show more concrete reason for people assent for it."
612,"SONY was one of the biggest companies which represented Japan to the world. However, because of Apple, or Microsoft, SONY went into the red recently. Right now, Japanese require SONY to reborn as the big company to the world. I think that was strange. In this century, the Internet systems became common and Apple, or Microsoft which is good at SNS became bigger and bigger. In order to make a big company which can compete with other companies in the world, Japan has to make a new company which has strong face to the Internet. We don't have to rely on only SONY. I hope some Japanese companies will compete with Apple or Microsoft in the future with new Internet system."
613,"I hope SONY and Panasonic overcome this situation. These days, more and more people use abroad products, for example Apple, Microsoft. However It causes various problems. Economic problem is one of them. We should use Japanese products for Japan. Also SONY and Panasonic have very good products. We should be proud of them."
614,"I think that Japanese people's Kanji skill has fallen.Due to digitization progresses, the opportunity to write by our hand is decreasing.However, I think that the capability to use the Chinese character itself does not change even if the capability to write a Chinese character falls.When we change hiragana to kanji with a personal computer, we ourselves have to decide which to use. I think that ability has not fallen, as people consider."
615,"Although illegal download is not good to be sure, the Internet is developed increasingly and I think that it is difficult to stop illegal download even if we make severe law.But severe punishment should be needed, so as not to increase the number of illegal download."
616,"Vandalism is really sad thing. It is not good to modify arts except when restoration has been needed. But there was an example which failed in restoration of pictures in Spain. Although she was not intended, it became somewhat different from an original picture. In the end, what she did is vandalism. We should have left it as it was."
617,"I think the punishments are too harsh. It is impossible to expect a natural phenomenon perfectly, and it is the seismologist itself that is primarily disappointed rather than ours. Probably those who believe the scholar's idea in the back also decrease in number, I consider that it means they receive punishment enough."
618,"It's a really difficult topic, but I do hope SONY recover its prestige. It's true that foreign products are relatively low and more and more consumers like it these year. For example, Samsung and Apple is so popular in these 10years. But we should buy our country's product more because Japan's technology has its own tradition and history, and has been sophisticated continuously. Of course foreign country admit it. so we must reconsider the importance of domestic industry and products."
619,"I think its surely deploring thing. However, it's difficult to specify who is responsible for the nurse's death. To be sure, those 2 radio DJ committed a joke that had gone too far. But what on earth did they expect that they would kill a person. People may not be able to condemn them too much. The most sorrowful thing is that the news of unborn prince/princess turned into something sad."
620,"I heard this radio program was not live broadcasting. I think DJs are stupid,moreover director of this program is most stupid. The director should have decide not to broadcast this bad taste program. Appropriate hoax attract people,but excessive one caused sad effect."
621,"I think this problem is too difficult to solve. But I think Sony is wrong to chose the course of action. To understand the needs of users and reflect the voices of users to products is important. Recent computers are improving the faculty had by computers originally, but it's the boundary to do. So the computer should advance to the other way, not only to evolve to small size, reduce weight and hurry."
622,"the problem is difficult for me. i don't know how we should do. in any case, I hope Sony and Panasonic to recover."
623,"I think that it is very big problem for future generations that Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji'. Now, due to smartphone like iPhone spread, the ability to write character correctly. I think this is very important problem and should be solved immediately. If this situation will continue, in the near future, it has a big influence for the next generations."
624,"I was sad to hear this news story. The two DJs rushed to make the hoax call, or did so without predicting that their trick call would cause her suicide. Any one can hardly foresee that this kind of hoax call would lead somebody to commit suicide. So I think, they are less responsible for her death than many people think."
625,"realistDec. 17, 2012 - 03:10AM JST The Japanese people who voted for the LDP and Ishihara are living in cloud cuckoo land. Back to the bad old days of patriotic education, visits to Yasukini, changing the Constitution, building more airports in the middle of nowhere, denying The Rape pf Nanjing, teachers being forced to salute the Hinomaru and stand for the Kimigayo, maybe even the return of the Thought Police? Japan getting the nuclear bomb.yes, a great day for old Japan. The beginning of the end. I think this comment is quite radical. I want to vote for PLD, but I do not have right to vote. I do not want to go back to the time like WW2. But Japan must power up military power in order to compete with China and North Korea. This general election is last chance to save this country. This comment is irrelevance."
626,"I think its surely deploring thing. It's difficult to specify who is responsible for the nurse's death. However,DJs and director of this program is bad and must be punished. I hope the accident like this never happen"
627,i think this news is pretty deplorable. i don't know who is responsible.
628,"I am totally agree with opinion of warispeace. Even result of Japanese election had expected, I was quite surprised about the news that LDP-which on-looked 3.11disater- won the election. Many intellectuals of japan and another country expected japan will have a big change because of 3.11 disaster. And actually, there was a change in Japanese society like democratic action. Even though That kind of democratic action is usual in another country, I cannot say that is little change of japan.Compare with before, there was big change in Japanese society indeed. But what I want to say is, Japanese civilization could not make meaningful change. In democratic society, Only result of election have meaning. And I think this situation-Japanese citizen could not make their political will as a result of election- is crisis of Japanese democracy. An addition, Japanese should think about another country which damaged by radioactive gushed in Atomic generation of Fukushima. Damaged by radioactive is not only problem of Japanese. That is also harmful for neighbor countries of Japan.Finally, I think it is the time that Japanese should think about relation with another countries. Japan cannot get along with other Asian countries with arrogant policy of LDP"
629,"I was shocked when I read this news.Because Sony was one of biggest company in Japan, and I believed Sony was making a profit. Certainly, Apple and Samsung is popular. But, I think Sony have a trump card, that is games. I like Sony's games,and want to expansion the territory."
630,"I think this news is very sad. Because two DJ's careless action caused suicide of one valued women. I'm sure that she is very responsible for her job. I heard the news about apologetic conference of DJs. Though they regretted and even Ms. Greig cried, I can't allow the hoax. Each people have their sense of value. So we have to consider whether an action we'll do is really right or not every time. This accident happened because It's too late to notice and I think it's serious because no one can revive this women."
631,"Firstly, it's obvious that scientists are never prophets. If scientists were punished when they couldn't predict perfectly what happens in the future, who on earth want to be a scientist. Then, I'd like to see whether there were irrational purpose of Italian government, or, in fact, they hadn't prepared much for a big disaster so they turned their responsibility to those scientists. It's just possible that lots of people may hit upon this idea. If so, Italian government may lose their trust.I strongly think that governments should always be neutral and have some degree of cleanness for their nation."
632,"SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49PM JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). This comment shows the result of this election briefly. I guess many voters consider that DPJ was bad, it is natural for DPJ to lose. But they don't think that LDP is good, though they voted for LDP, and LDP won.Many voters still have negative image for LDP, but there is no other choice but to vote for LDP. The result was not welcomed. Everything happens for a reason,although not necessarily a good one."
633,"I knew this news before I read the article now. I was surprised because of the nurse's death. Just only telling Kate's health situation to the two DJs, she got responsible for this incident and died. I could understand the action which two DJs did, but this time, they had responsible of her death. I hope this accident shouldn't happen again."
634,"I agree with ID1224. I think many voters didn't have any party which they want to support. The didn't have any choice about voting, so they couldn't be helped to vote to LDP. I became 20th years old in this year, so I went to vote at the first time yesterday. I didn't have any interesting about Japanese government before, but now, I entered as an 'adult' and I tried to watch News about voting or listen parties' speech. As Japanese, we should have more attention to Japanese government and change the bad economy as soon as possible with LDP."
635,"It's regrettable problem. Because of PC and smartphone, the chance of writing kanji is going down. I think Japan needs to reform educational system and make people obligate to get 'kanken'."
636,"&gt;JimizoDec. 17, 2012 - 12:18AM JST An abject failure the first time around and then leads his party to a landslide victory in a choice between losers, nutcases and non-entities. I suppose someone had to win. I disagree this issue. All of the Parties including the Liberal Democratic Party are classified in losers, nutcases and non- entities and all of them don't think about Japan.I think The Liberal Democratic Party is the Party which is not wanted to win but have to win."
637,"I think loosing ability to write kanji is naturally for recent peole.But I also think we should protect skill of writing Japanese character . Because,kanji is one of the most important cultures."
638,"When I knew the news of two DJs' careless action at first , I didn't expect her death. So I was very surprised and shocked by her death, and felt very sad. The DJs might not intent to cause such a scene, but their action is not allowed and is punished. I hope such a scene not happen again."
639,"I was astonished at this news. I don't mean the death of the nurse. I just cannot believe such malicious mischief was really done.What they did was not just a mischief but the invasion of the patient's privacy. Generally, some media often try to get and broadcast secret information about celebrities in order to attract more customers. It's true the media have the right to search and broadcast news. But ,at the same time, they also have to think highly of people's rights of privacy. This case is more serious. Naturally, hospitals are where patients are free from outside pressure and concentrate on recovering their health. But the radio hosts invaded such patient's privacy by deceiving her nurse. Few people imagine the media chase the patient even to the hospital. So, I don't think the nurse is responsible for the invasion of the patient's privacy. Instead, the radio hosts should take full responsibility."
640,"I was so shocked at this news because I've never heard such a kind of news. When I heard this news story, one question came to my head. Is DJs really to be blame for nurse's death? There may be pros and cons, but I don't think DJs are not responsible for that. They just want to heat up the radio program ,of course not plan to kill her. So they were in good faith, if saying in law term. It's true that nurse's death was so sad and It was tragedy. But I do think it doesn't make sense to blame DJs or TV programmer."
641,"I agree with ID1244 and ID1242's opinion. Nobody foresee the future perfectly. Needless to say, all researchers are human. Also human cannot avoid making mistakes. This judgment will restrain Italian researchers from research fully and the research of Italy will fall behind. This judgment should be reconsidered as soon as possible. However, researchers need to realize their responsibility. The general public tends to rely on them at the time of emergency. For safety of nation, they must not act irresponsibly."
642,"NathawDec. 17, 2012 - 08:33AM JST Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with Nathaw. Abe's economic policy is excessively drastic. Other than spending so much money on public enterprises, he also plants to revise the law of Bank of Japan in order to boost economic growth. Such a policy can rather give bad effect on Japanese economy by causing awful inflation. The law plays an important role in preventing extreme inflation by inhibiting the central bank from buying the government bonds directly from the government. If the central bank is allowed to issue limitless amount of money and compelled to buy government bonds, extravagant finance is also accelerated. The more finance deficit is accumulated, the worse inflation gets, results in default. So, even if this policy gives good effect on Japanese economy by leading inflation, the benefit is temporary. Instead, it can do harm to the economy. He should aware that there is enormous demerit in the economic policy."
643,"I agree with ID1248's opinion. For an economic recovery, SONY and Panasonic should restore themselves. The government need to negotiate with foreign countries and international communities, like USA and EU for the conclusion of Economic Partnership Agreement(EPA) or Free Trade Agreement(FTA). In this respect, Korea is one step ahead of Japan. I think that is why Samsung is good condition now. I heard that 2,950 employees of SHARP lost their jobs on 15 December. The Government, especially Mr. Abe must take some steps immediately."
644,"I was also shocked at this news. Needless to say, Mel Greig and Michael Christian intended Jacintha Saldanha no harm. I think that they just would like to direct their radio programs. However they should repent of duping an excellent nurse'. And I knew that when we talk publicly, we have to be careful. Like this news, we may harm someone by our statements."
645,"I think it's natural for SONY and other companies such as Panasonic to lose their power in the market. Once companies got too big, it's very hard for these companies to change their direction of management. Even if they knew not change one would lead their companies to lose their power. They have to maintain their customer as much as possible, so they can't enter to new market like other smaller companies do. I hope these companies to overcome the situation since these are companies that represent Japan's strength in the market."
646,"I was shocked when I read this article. Because of DJ's foolish act, one's life lead to end. I think this nurse have very a strong sense of responsibility to her job and that made her life to end. Later I found the article that these DJs receive advance notice that they would be murdered by anonymous. I think they deserve it. Reading this article remind me that one foolish act could lead to something horrible. Even if one think that's just a joke, maybe others think it seriously."
647,"I think the Sony is going crazy. Actually, my father used to work for them, but he quit recently and, their work is getting worse and worse. In spite of that, they started to carry out mandatory retirement for managers at a certain age. I do not understand what they are trying, and believe what they need in fact is experience."
648,"It is very sad story. Of, course, the DJs conducted very stupid prank should be punished and apologize deeply for family of the nurse forever. But, I can not understand why the nurse actually committed a suicide. If I were her, I would have just quit the hospital and gone with depressed feeling. Perhaps, other nursed in the hospital condemned her for revealing the information of the condition of the queen harshly. So, the nurses in the hospital should be investigated, too."
649,"as everyone said, i also felt shocked after reading this news. and as ID1248 said, i think she did not needed to kill herself. also, i cannot understand why DJs did such a hoax thing on radio."
650,"I am starting to forget how to write kanji in the right way and I think it comes from using computer as a studying tool. It is common thing to use computer to write report even in junior high school now. By using computer there would be less time for us to think about which one is the right kanji or how was the right way to right kanji. I think it is good thing to use computer to write something because it is more efficient. But I think Japanese people should be careful to have enough time to learn kanji. Sometimes I feel shame when I sow students studying abroad in Japan, writes difficult kanji which some of us don't know."
651,"as ID1244 and ID1242 said, it is true that Sony and Panasonic needs to come up with a new product to catch up to Apple and Samsung. but i think it is easy to affiliated with Apple or Samsung. because Japanese industries are still wandering after the depression that happened in 2008."
652,i think mr.obama's re-election is meaningful to Japanese economy and the problems with north Korea and china. president Obama wants japan to join TPP and i know this will let down Japanese agriculture but i believes that it will makes Japanese industries better. also mr.obama thinks that world needs to be safe and peace so he might do something when north and china became crazy.
653,"I was surprised four years ago, when Obama become first Black president in United States. Now, I was surprised once again. Through his four year career as president, there were many incident happen in United States. That include confront between Iraq. I think especially withdraw U.S. military from Iraq and execute Osama Bin Laden works great for Obama's re-election. Also, he mention that he support gay marriage. It must be such a great news for people who are gay/lesbian who were discriminated. I think that earns his votes too. I hope Obama will do more great work in his second term of his presidency."
654,"i was very surprised when i read this news . and i still cannot believe why did they have to go to jail and need to pay nine million euro. as it said on this news, i think it is scientist's job to tell what they know to other people who do not know."
655,"I am pretty sure that even after the new low took effect, the sales of CD and DVD wont get better. I think people especially young people these days are starting to come apart from CD and DVD because now we have new tool to use spend time like computer and iphones. And I also think that there wont be much less people who downloads illegally. It is difficult to find people who i doing it and there could also be people who downloads not knowing what they are doing is illegal. I used to use application which downloads music from YouTube with just few steps. After the low has come out, I was scared to use the application because I wasn't sure whether it is illegal or not to use the application. So I sent a mail to the company to ask whether it is ok or not to download music using that application. The answer I got was very vague. It even said they cant answer this kind of delicate question. I am not really sure it is illegal to use it, but I am sure that there are still many people who uses those kind of applications not knowing it could be illegal."
656,"I think this kind of accident happened because there weren't enough security to save the picture. In Japan, museum is strictly secured so I think this kind of accident wouldn't happen. When I went to museum abroad, the impression I got was not secured enough which was opposite to my expectation. If there are something important in the museum, the owner should do their best to protect the it."
657,"I agree with ID1224. Comments and article itself shows that people are not accepting LDP, but because they don't want to vote to DPJ. There are people who oppose LDP in the comments. However, exclude China and Korea, many Asia countries and United States praise the election of LDP. To Asian countries, they fear China and Korea's rapid military expansion. LDP announce that they would create Self-Defense Force, that could collective defense with allies where Japan is not directly related. To Asian countries, Japan's military expansion are something helpful for them. To Unites States, once officer told that it's used to be said that elect of LDP would make Japan right-wing, but actually Japan used to be left-wing, and elect of LDP would make it neutral. As my opinion, I'm somewhat worried about Abe's Economic Policy. I think it's too optimistic. Many experts said that his policy would boost inflation. Japan's economy is not stable even now. To make such a big action would collapse everything. Also, it's not only about LDP nor DPJ, I want Prime Minister to complete at least their first term as Prime Minister. I think too many changes of Prime Minister and their policy made Economic worse. Economy used to be unstable and rapid change of policy are ruining Economy."
658,"many people disagrees about EU winning the novel peace prize, but i think they should deserve one. as ID1248 said, no war for 60 years in EU is valuable thing so other countries should follow EU's example."
659,i feel really sorry for Rothko and hope that his painting will remedy as soon as possible. and i think museum should put more guards to protect paintings and other articles.
660,"I was shocked and disappointed after reading this news because what he did is nonsense as ID1248 said. Because of his action, she killed herself but I think that she did not need to kill herself."
661,I was shocked and surprised by her death as everyone said. She has a strong sense of responsibility but I think that it was not necessary to kill herself. DJ's action was forgivable.
662,"I was not very surprised to know that Japanese people are losing their ability to write kanji because I have experienced not to be able to remember some characters since I got used to use computers. Even though I understand that I should write by hand as much as possible in order to maintain my kanji skill, I cannot actually do it because it is much easier and more convenient to type on computers. If all the people feel the same way and continue to avoid handwriting, what author is concerned about might come true. However, I would like to insist here that our kanji culture and Japanese pride are a lot stronger than that. Thus, I do not think that we have to take this as a serious problem for the future children and believe that they will still be able to write kanji and cherish the culture 'by blood.'"
663,"I don't think the Italian six scientists have to be punished. Scientists always explore and foresee many things what may happen. It is natural works for scientists, I think. Also in Japan, after the 3.11, I have heard many forecasts about earthquakes. I think the scientists' forecasts make people prepare for the worst, and the preparations make people be safe."
664,"I think it is very difficult problem. Today, many people uses smartphones or tablets, and Apple or Samsung are influential in this field. Actually, I use iphone, and around me, many people use iphone. But I want Sony and Panasonic overcome this situation. I think Japanese companies can show their reliance and make original goods."
665,"I personally agree with the law which bans illegal music downloading although some people complain about this new launch. I have once downloaded music illegally long time ago and my computer got virus from the file when opened. Since then, I have thought that any people who continue downloading music illegally could face such situation and this may cause a leakage of important information which a computer might have. I cannot think of any better solutions than banning illegal music downloads. If it also helps the music market, the law is surely the best decision of all that the government could ever suggest."
666,I wonder how much money did museum spend to remedy the defaced painting. I think the criminal must compensate all the money the museum spend and this kind of news shouldn't happen again.
667,"No war for 60 years is good. But, I felt strange that EU got a Novel peace prize because, EU is not only a country that without war for 60 years. It not fair."
668,"I do not understand at all why the man has done such thing. The exhibit which got defaced is not just an art but the fruit of the artist's efforts, sweat and tears. It can be said that the action of defacing the painting actually broke his heart and I feel very sorry for him. To prevent this kind of crime, it is necessary for every art gallery to reinforce the security that it has."
669,"I think EU should not win the novel peace prize because they are not ready enough. I think that the novel peace prize should be given to the person who has completed it work which had made a good effect for world peace. These days, I think standard of the novel prize is blurring. As I said, it should be given to the person who has completed the work. Not ti the person who has only started, like president Obama and Graminbank. I feel it is sad that the novel prize is becoming something that doesn't mean anything."
670,When I heard this story I was shocked. I think two DJs did stupid thing. I think it is responsible for the two DJs.
671,"I think that Sony still have a power to recover the situation. They have a technology to make a good product however they don't have a platform. So, they need a original platform which is different from other. It will lead to make more fans of Sony."
672,There is no need of a scientist if people know whats going to happen in the future.Scientists job is to guess what could happen and they are not a prophet.This punishment is too strict and it is a shame for the scientists.
673,This is difficult story for me. I think Sony and Panasonic are biggest company in Japan so I hope they would do better in business and recover their situation.
674,Sony is a top class company that supports Japans economy and they must overcome this situation for Japan to come revive.Sony have the quality and I wish them to be the top of the world.
675,I think EU don't deserve Nobel Peace Prize . It is not appropriate reason that EU recognition of 60years with out war.
676,"I think it is too late for Japanese company to catch up with companies abroad. Japan should have been aware of companies abroad especially Asian country, more early. It is obvious that Asian country's companies were thinking Japan as a rival which they should win for the first thing. They were all thinking of the way to win Japanese companies while we were only thinking of the new product with out any aim. Though it is too late, I think Japanese companies should ether cooperate with foreign country or find the way to take the market, which we used to own, away from Asian companies."
677,"It is sad news that the nurse subsided but, in my opinion, the nurse didn't kill herself. I think she was killed by MI6 or secret service. Anyway, the DJs is stupid and they have to apologize more."
678,"I don't know whether Japanese writing skills is losing, like that this news story says. However, these days there are too a lot of digital tools, for example smartphones and computers. So, it is right that the chance of writing documents with pens is less and less. In fact, I type on my smartphone every day. Writing kanji is important Japanese culture, so if our writing skill is losing, I think it is a big problem. However, I don't feel my writing skill is losing. I think that it is more important to make sentences to protect Japanese culture even if we use digital tools. Of cause, kanji is an old good culture. We don't have to forget them. I should use them in making documents, but it is not necessary to say for us."
679,"I was kind of surprised to the news in the point that queen and prince has a big effect for the majority. In Japan, though we admire emperor but not really for real. I have a image that in England they admire queen so much. And i think that is the reason which caused this suicide. If the same thing happened in Japan, I think the nurse wouldn't have killed herself."
680,"I was shocked to hear this news.First I thought that the DJs were the one who should take the responsible but after the lesson,I thought that the colleagues and the chief executive have the responsible too.They should have done the after care well but they could have put all the responsible on Jacintha and that may have led her to commit suicide."
681,"Like most students have written in their comments, I do not think it is appropriate for the EU to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, there is a fact that the economic crisis which the world is still suffering from was caused by one of the EU country. Also, I am not persuaded by the idea that they received the prize in recognition of 60 years without war. It is not quite fair for other countries which have kept their peace for more than 60 years and have caused any problems like the world depression."
682,"It is totally ridiculous that the six scientists were punished for underestimating the risk of an earthquake. No one can ever predict what happens especially when it is a natural disaster. If those six could estimate exactly how strong an earthquake is or what time, no one would have died in an earthquake. I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgement of Italy is too strict."
683,"I think the award of EU is not strange. I would like to show two the reason. First, there have been no war theses 60 years in EU, it is worth to being praised. I studied the world history in high school, so I can understand the difficulty to keep piece there. The history of Europe is the history of wars. So, when I think the fact, This situation without wars for 60 years is wonderful. Secondly, this prize implies to expect EU to fight this danger situation of EU. Now, EU has big financial problem with Greece. I think this Novel Prize means that cheering EU to get over it."
684,"I think this punishment was too strict. If they kept doing this kind of thing, there wouldn't be any scientist or scholar who would try to alarm the earthquakes to us. As long as we live in the country where earthquake happens we should be prepared and the help of scientists would help us a lot."
685,"I am quite happy for Barack Obama and the citizens of the United States as his odyssey continues to its full measure. I was first surprised when he acquired the position of the U.S. president because I did not imagine American people would accept a 'black' as their leader(I do not mean to discriminate). However, all his work he has done throughout 4 years, I personally like him as I can see the real honesty in him and his statements. I also respect him as a great speaker compared to other presidents from all over the world."
686,"I like Barack Obama and know how much effort he made for the citizens because I have lived in the United States and learned many measures he tried. Unfortunately, the rate of unemployment has not changed a little, but I think he deserves to be the most respectable president in the world. Also, it is important for Japan. We are in dangerous situation about the islands among China, and Korea. Maybe he cares about Japan and saves us."
687,"Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later."
688,"In Japan, recently the sales of CD have been decreasing. In the age of our parents, the way to get music was only buying CD, so the sales of it were greatly big. However we can download music from Internet now, so there are many way to get them illegally and freely. Downloading music is cheap and easy, that is why more and more people use the Internet to get. A lot of people have illegal music in their ipods, smartphones or computers. In addition to, they don't know it is punishment. I think this situation was caused by the past that Japan's government hadn't ban this conduct more quickly. If they had banned illegal downloaded music, it wouldn't be popular now, in my opinion."
689,"One of the policies of Barack Obama about tax resulted in his re-election, I think. In US, the gap between the rich and the poor is quite big, and it would have become much harder for so-called low income earners to live if a policy that advocate raising tax had been adopted. Obama promised not to do that instead he would raise tax only for wealthy people. The policy gathered voter support. I hope the policy promotes wealth redistribution and work well."
690,"After reading this article, I think this punishment is not effective because the police can't arrest all people who download illegally. Many people think this change promote to prevent illegally download but it is not true. I think we should use the internet carefully and care about ourselves."
691,"I think this punishment is not illegal because the scientists tried to estimated and alarmed. They have no crimes. when earthquake occurred, we must prepare, be careful and protect ourselves."
692,Not only Sony but also other Japanese companies don't have power to compete against overseas company such as Apple. The reason losing competition is Japanese company has no products which attract many people. Japanese company should be strong to compete against other big companies.
693,"After reading this news, I was surprised because this accident is unreasonable. The nurse did just her job but she felt blame and she was killed by herself.This is an irrational accident. I think this woman has no crime and the DJ must punish."
694,"I do not think it amusing that EU wins a Nobel Peace Prize . Because, EU is no-war for 60 years. Moreover, by having won the Nobel peace prize, it is thought that the consciousness of the peace of EU will become strong from now on. Therefore, this award is good."
695,"I think that this judgment is amusing. Because, it is since a natural disaster is not what people can predict. Not a scientist but a public policy thinks that it is bad."
696,"I think that this reelection is good for the United States. Obama will lead the United States with strong leadership. However, for Japan, it is not necessarily good. Pains will be taken over a foreign policy from now on."
697,"I think that this problem is very difficult. Now, many companies, such as an apple and Samsung, are going into Japan. It is difficult to overcome these companies. However, if it is Sony which has towed Japan until now also, I expect that it is OK."
698,"I think that this incident is very sad. Probably, it was not able to expect that who brought such a result. Therefore, I cannot regard the party concerned as not much bad, either. Who is the most responsible?"
699,"cracaphatDec. 17, 2012 - 08:14AM JST Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought. I agree with this opinion. I was not so interested in this election, either. Especially this is caused by that neither interest nor expectation has a young man in the latest politics. Therefore, I think that this voter turnout is the somewhat higher one. In order to raise, future politics needs to be substantial."
700,"I am surprised by this news story because I think her behavior is excessive. I think that hoax is also excessive. A hoax is very funny to people who watch. But, this case kill a person. I am a person who hardly doubt things. So, I angry about this news because this hoax took advantage of a victim's faith. A hoax is very funny. But, a hoax it takes advantage of his faith and kindness is the worst act."
701,"Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27AM JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion. I think a change of the party in power does not make a change for society. But, I cannot understand people who do not go to the election by this reason. Certainly, it may not make any change. But, we should not reconcile the government because I think this act connects an indifferent to the government. So, we should make use of suffrage."
702,"I think this change like Sony is a natural incident because in machine industry it is very quick to change new products. So, companies should make an effort. But, I think the government should support development of technology because if the government do not support, Japanese companies lose international competition. According to the news story, digital platforms is run by five big companies. Microsoft keeps winning in a side of OS. But, Facebook is a new tool. So, I think there is a chance to win digital platforms market. I think it is said the same in device market."
703,"I'm really worried about Obama becoming a president again. Especially the relation between Japan. Generally, the Democratic Party is not pro-Japanese. I think it will be difficult for Japan to desire the growth of economy, diplomacy and so on."
704,"I'm really happy that LDP got back the politic power again. Among this 3 years Japan got weak. I hope that Mr.Abe will change Japan. Some people mention that president change is a bad thing . In my opinion, I don't care. Because Japan is different from other country,there is an emperor in the middle. Although, I was worried that when the political power was in the DPJ. Because they don't care about the emperor. I think the mass media is horrible in Japan. The mass media has brainwashed many Japanese people so that many people can't judge the right way."
705,"I think the award of EU is natural. the fact that there have been no war in 60years is so admirable. Were it not for EU,big war among countries would've fired,I guess. so it's worth to be praised."
706,"Illegal download will be regulated and punishment will be tightened. But I don't think it will works well. First, however the law may be tightened, it's no use unless the sense of guilt among listeners will change even little by little. They don't understand(or dare not to understand) why illegal download bothers artist. So they have to know cash flows and why their downloading is illegal."
707,"I'm very impressed that Obama won re-election after the 1940. Furthermore, he got more than 50% votes. However, I realize Obama is not gaining a backing from Whites while Blacks support him as 93% elect rate. Now, in America, people who want medical care have to spend expensive cost or have to be insured.(besides, insuring programs isn't cheap at all to the middle, the lower classes.)However, Obama is planning to promote the public good by magnifying medical insurance more friendly to welfare. I expect his active part until he ends his duty."
708,"According to this article, Obama's re-election is evaluated in that he is only the fourth Democrat since 1900 to win two full terms in the White House. In this regard, I think, now we should observe it from another point. That is present leaders need much more time than ever to accomplish his policy enough. For now, in the far more fluid and complex world, only by short-term strategies, leaders can't make a difference. They have to do well with so many countries and deal with highly developed economy in order to be supported by people in his country. To do so, they inevitably need a long period of time. So I think that even if Obama couldn't do well in the last 4 years, another 4 years will help him bring something good for both US and the world."
709,"I also think that SONY missed the shift that has led the company to miss its shot at platform power. The reason for this might be that it has been contented with conventional regular customers consuming it's product now and future. So they has concentrated on closing them around, losing sight of the view to go next stage or digital platform. This is applicable to many other Japanese countries, such as Panasonic, SHARP, and so on. They should surely recognize that emerging nations are strong in the manufacturing industry and should take on the responsibility of acting as platform."
710,"Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27AM JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon. I disagree to his opinion because there are already a little signs of an economic recovery, which we can't see during (at least) the last 3 years. Even if it is based only on expectations for the new leader, the fact is that rising the price of stocks is making big benefits for companies and hole economy. I hope that this time he surely makes a difference for Japan."
711,"I think downturn of Sony is caused by a lack of recognition about information technology trend. People use messengers such as LINE at the moment however, In japan, people used to use mails but not LINE. Moreover, it was rare to see smart-phones. In my perspective, this kind of life pattern made Japan company to think smart-phone industry is not important to their business. It will be very hard to overcome this crisis since Apple, Samsung or even Nokia dominated smart-phone industry. Therefore, I suggest to Japan electronic companies to concentrate their efforts to make applications and peripheral device."
712,"&gt;Nathaw at Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33AM JST &gt;Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with this comment. Japan has too many debts. PM Abe told that government would increase them and grow up economy. But if the plan fail, how will Japan recover? I'm afraid that Japan loses the trust of many other foreign countries."
713,"After LDP took the control of Japanese Government, it was broadcast that strong yen stopped and gradually shifting to weaker yen, in addition the share prices are rising in Japan. These are necessary for Japan to recover from recent economic depression. We cannot say that good situation last forever, but at least we can find hope. I hope this fact will encourage people not to be disappointed about economic situation."
714,"Once European countries had made war. But EU aimed stabilization of economy and developed a sense of camaraderie, and as a result, no war is going on in Europe. This is great thing, I think. Thinking of Asian countries' confrontation-such as China, North Korea, and Japan-EU's grappling is meaningful. However, not existence of war was brought not only by positive actions for peace but also by the natural course."
715,I think this punishment is wrong. We can not predict when perfectly natural phenomena such as earthquakes and typhoons will happen even if the technology developed . The scientist's punishment is illegal and it is not their responsibility. The punishment is too strict and should be reconsidered.
716,"Japanese are losing ability to write kanji because the development of the computer has changed the whole life-style of us. Personally, I think this phenomenon reflects the times, and we cannot go against the times. So certain amount of loss is inevitable. But culturally, this damage is too serious. So we must rethink how to use computers and realize again the importance of Japanese traditional kanji."
717,"Owing to the price destruction, commodities made by Sony have been selling poorly, though Sony has made a lot of goods. Originally, it is important for companies to make creative commodities that are not compared with others, in order not to be seized the right to decide a price by mass marketers. I guess Sony doesn't be aware of it very much. Anyway, I can't bring myself to see the state that Sony follows a path of decline, because Sony is also one of the companies which Japan is proud of."
718,"I think the police cannot crack down on illegal downloading because they can't investigate all the computers appropriately. But it will work as deterrent of illegal downloading. The new law may menace those who possess illegally downloaded materials. So the new law will take effect to some extent. But even if so, music sales will not improve because illegal downloading doesn't have a relation to music sales. I think music sales are in slump because we now listen to music in computers or don't listen to music as before. People aren't fascinated by CDs. So the Japanese music industry should make an effort to how to sell CDs. Fighting against online piracy is of secondary importance."
719,"I was socked when I heard this news. This DJs did absurd thing. And, I feel sorry that the nurse's life was lost. Mischiefs are good as long as it make people fun. I love mischiefs and I did a lot of mischiefs. But this mischief is mad because they cheat on people who have nothing to do with them. The DJs must express their regret and search their heart."
720,I love Sony and use a lot of Sony products. So I hope that Sony get back their former position. Sony must change in order to catch up with this world situation. Japanese company is in the difficult situation because of appreciating yen and commotion of politics. So this problem is not only Sony's problem but also problem which bother many Japanese global companies. Japan have tremendous problems now. And we Japanese must clear up.
721,"From point of view of Pro Japanese,I think it didn't matter which candidate was elected. Both candidates put stress on diplomacy toward China. The Japanese key is whether Japan can make a good use of this."
722,I expected that the Democratic party would manage Japanese politics successfully but it was a disappointment. I hope that Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem.
723,"'Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s).' I expect quite a few voters had no party for which they would stand. Many voters think DPJ was wrong, but they don't necessarily regard LDP as the next ruling party. There is no other choice, so they voted for LDP. In my own opinion, once Shinzo Abe resigned prime minister just because 'he had stomachache.' irresponsibly. He do not deserve to be the next prime minister."
724,"l welcome Obama's re-election. It must be a good for America's future. His policy hit the heart of not only the poor but relatively rich people. For Japan, we don't lack him. His power of improving economy is respectful, I think."
725,"I think vocabulary notebooks is very important tool to memorize the words or foreign languages. It's true that Simplifying the layouts to see clearly is necessary, but only re-read the note on which written down the meaning of the word for two languages is not effective. The most important is '' how the words are used''. So, when we make the notes, we must memorize the example sentence."
726,"I thought Sony was the most biggest company in the world. But, recently, Sony has deteriorated management. Conversely, Samsung in South-Korea has been developing. Sony can't recover its original position. I want it to try hard more."
727,"It's unbelievable to be suicide by a hoax call. The victim was very honest and be trusted by her colleague. Everyone was very sad that such a person passed away. If I were they, I felt the same things. I want everyone to stop a hoax call not to such a thing."
728,"I don't understand Obama's policy. Honestly, I don't know that it affect to me, but it seem to affect to Japan. Japan get along with America in the future. Firstly, Japan should do it to settle the problem between Japan and China."
729,"I don't understand Obama's policy. Honestly, I don't know that it affect to me, but it seem to affect to Japan. Japan get along with America in the future. Firstly, Japan should do it to settle the problem between Japan and China."
730,"↑ Sorry I missed. I don't know because I don't download music or films, but I here that other person often download it from Internet sites. I always rent CD or DVD at the shop. It is difficult to supervise those people, because many people practical use it."
731,"I think Obama is one of the greatest president in the postwar period. He can manage this global situation. In japan, new prime minister Abe was selected. I feel ease because Abe is the person who should be leader of Japan. He have defined vision of national defense. Japan has serious territory with China and South Korea. Japan must go in with U.S. But the democratic party is unwilling to manage this problem."
732,"Congratulations EU! I think it is good thing that EU got Nobel prize. Though EU have tremendous problems, EU have great meaning for future. Europe is mature place. So Europe must take point. Europe is in depression because of financial difficulties of Greece and Portugal. I think EU can great job."
733,That very valued painting was tarnished is sorry. But I cannot understand the value of this painting. But I have heard the name of this painter Rothko. I can not understand why such a painting is so expensive. The word of art is hard to understand. One day I want to be a person who can understand art and appreciate the beauty of art.
734,Author's copyright must be highly considered. But the law of author's copyright is not abided. I think this law is out of date. We use YouTube and Website and google search every day. We can easily infract the law of author's copyright. We must change the law or the concept of author's copyright. I think this situation must be changed immediately. This law make people and author uneasy.
735,"This article lets me know why Japanese companies have been declining in these days. It is because they have been focusing the device market, but now it does not required, the most required stuff is a platform like a hotspot. I did not know that and it is pretty fresh to me. Although I knew that Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple have great power, I did not know why these companies have great power and I have never tried considering that reason before. However, the device market has changed into the platform market before I know. Japanese company should widely expand the business without fear of failure. They should not be afraid of failing, just keep on trying. We always have to be more creative. Japanese economy has reminded stagnant and has declined. We cannot forget the past achievements and prestige. We were the 2nd powerful country in the past and we are proud of it, but now we are not in the position followed by other countries; we are in the position of coming from back; we are the challenger. We have to create many things that anyone cannot think. Consolidating Sony, Panasonic, NEC, Fujitsu, and Toyota into one company is one of ways to improve Japanese economy and it is a way not to lose the American five titans. We should just keep on trying."
736,"First of all, I feel sorry to this news. I think DJs have to take responsible for this incident. Of course, it could be said that nurse exaggerated her thoughts. However, If DJs did not hoax to her, the accident would not be occurred. Moreover, DJs impersonated the Queen. Nurse would be vulnerable at that moment since position is important in England. Furthermore, I cannot repress astonishment that DJ seems not to be repentant."
737,"I thought that the Democratic Party divided into two factions over the question about a consumption tax. In 2011, finally, 14 assemblymen left the party. I agree with ID1244. I also expect that LDP would recover business conditions. For that, Mr.Abe should have a sense of a responsibility and LDP must act in a body."
738,"I can't understand why the man defected the Rothko's painting. Even if he didn't like the art, his vandalism was wrong with the judge as a human being. Of cause, I think everyone have each thought, ideal and religion…… but, there are what we shouldn't do actually. His way to express was wrong, because it gave hurt to people including Rothko's children emotionally. I hope that the Tate Gallery will remedy that painting as soon as possible. However, the fact that the painting was defected will be not remedy."
739,"For such a crime, museum strengthen security. As a result, we cannot enjoy looking at the paintings at close range. Many people want to watch the details and appreciate pictures easily. So we should protect pictures in the way that don't hurt splendor of the art"
740,"I am for the eurosceptics. I think that EU took an important role in postwar confusion. But it should not be praised now. EU now has many problems such as economic difficulties, and it doesn't seem to have brought a peace to the world. So the award isn't deserved. Possibly the prize will encourage European people to press forward and solve the current problems. But it has nothing to do with the world peace too much. Important thing is what EU did, not what EU will do. Many people misunderstand the meaning of Nobel Peace prize."
741,"I disagree to the sentencing of six Italian seismologists because I think that the judge may bother publication of scientist. If their announces was wrong, they would be sentenced. It give scientists a lot of risk. So, they may not refrain from their new discovery or research. I think it will have a bad influence on the freedom of science study, advance in our life and human happiness."
742,This law must be done because many people download music or video.A lot of company regarding CD have lost much money because of that.
743,"It is unbelievable news. Where a natural disaster is concerned, we cannot estimate completely what will occur. Surely no one should speak about matters of great importance hastily and thoughtlessly. But scientists need to be able to keep researching and share what they know. If they lose the right, the scientific development will stop. So I think they should not have been punished for their right to research and our future."
744,"It is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged and they need to be fixed as soon as possible. Many people all over the world as well as I are feeling the same way, I think"
745,"jansob1DEC. 16, 2012 - 09:03PM JST Now taking bets....will Abe last a full year? I say 10 months. I am sad to see this comment.Actually the Prime Minister in japan changes so quickly by turn. However, I would like him to have a hope. Liberty party has govern Japan for many times expect last two or three years.So i think Abe will not quit his position."
746,"Some people say that Japanese language is 'the most beautiful language in the world'. Although Kanji has its roots in China, Japanese people has arranged them to be unique and beautiful form. So I think it's too deplorable that Kanji, a sort of Japanese 'identity', may disappear from our culture."
747,"Actually, I can not say which is better. However, Mr.Obama rendered some services to military affairs. I think that he has an ability to manage his country. And, at the presidential election, he promised that the government makes employment opportunities at the manufacturing industry. To be concrete, a million people will get the jobs. I expect that he fulfill a campaign promise immediately."
748,"This is the unbelievable news. It was natural that the two DJs would be condemned by people and the nurse exposed a secret which is about Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy should be also judged like two DJs. Although I do not know how confidential and important the secret was, in any case the victim's colleague; Saldanha's colleague should have kept the secret. However, we can guess the confidentiality of this secret was pretty high because Saldanha killed herself due to revealing the secret. I want to know why the two DJs pretended to be the Queen and Prince Charles. I believed that they meant no harm, they just joked before I read the 2nd paragraph from the bottom. When I read the whole article, I thought the two DJs should be punished in some form or other."
749,"I think Sony is one of the biggest makers in Japan and popular all over the world, so I was surprised with knowing this news story. In other words, I was disappointed. I believe that it is Sony that the company leads economy of Japan, so I would like to Sony have power to compete with other country. I think that Sony should change along the world trend for himself and Japan. If not, Japan would not catch up with the world. To survive, we have to have an effort on the best."
750,"I think most people who downloads illegal files do it deliberately, not without knowing, so this stricter change is necessary. But I don't think this law makes any big changes about the sales of CDs or DVDs because the cause of today's its decrease consists of many factors, not only illegal downloads."
751,"It's sad that a great work of art was vandalized. I want to know why the person did so. If he did that simply as a prank, it couldn't be allowed, but somehow I think there is any other reason."
752,"In recent years, Nobel Peace Prize tends to be awarded as a hope to the winner's success of its future (for example, Obama was awarded shortly after he was inaugurated as President). Maybe it's the same thing this time. So I think it is not something to get angry."
753,"I agree to the new law. Because it is related to many problems of privacy, and we do that action without knowing, I think. So, I think illegal downloads should be restricted by strict law."
754,"I feel it's very regrettable of the decision. It may give 'chilling effects' to other scientists. People should realize that there is a limit even to science, and should judge all the research results by their own risk."
755,"It is said that 99.98% of all of the Corporation goes bankrupt in 30 years. Thinking about this thing, the exist of Sony is almost a miracle. I want to see the 'miracle' in the future, so I hope them to survive."
756,"I think it is terrible incident. Tate Gallery should remedy this situation immediately,and do the best to prevent from occurring the incident like this again."
757,"We can't know what happened to the nurse's mental state after she knew that was a prank call, but the pressure may be immeasurable. The DJs should be punished for some sin, even they did it as a joke, I think."
758,"I agree with ID1246 comment. I think EU doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. Because 60 years without war is a good point but, some countries in the EU have continued economic recession. There are a lot of unemployed. EU does not deserve the prize in economic . Too early to get a prize."
759,"I disagree to the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, the EU's recognition of 60 years without war is really good, I think. But they forget the Cold War. After WW2, they struggled for their profits and many countries are suffered from WW2 and the Cold War. So, I think the EU should not won the Nobel Peace Prize."
760,"I doubt that emails influence writing ability. If there are not emails, we write a letter? We wouldn't write a letter, and we would use telephone. In other words, emails don't effect writing ability."
761,"I think that Obama is suitable for U.S. President. He stressed importance of resolving the challenges that the world have, such as violent extremism,insurgency and spread of nuclear weapons. Whereas, Romney emphasized 'Peace through Strength'. I think Romney was too idealistic. U.S. can't lead the world without solving the current problems. Though it is uncertain whether Obama succeeds or not, I believe he is a good president."
762,"'Thomas Anderson Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:52PM JST 41% voted... pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE.' I think this result of turnout cannot be helped to be amazed by foreign people. The 'apathy' to politics of Japanese people is serious. I think they should lower the age to obtain the right to vote, and to enable young people take interest to politics."
763,The reason people download music illegally is consciousness is not enough to consider it as illegal. I hope this law change become good opportunity they consider it illegal.
764,"I can't believe this news, because the victim was killed by a hoax call. I think they had to think well, and I hope that they won't do such a thing again. After the accident have happened, the excuse doesn't be accepted. It is the best way that we don't such a foolish thing."
765,"I can't understand such a stupid action. This crime is difficult to protect. Because the motive is wonder. To protect such crime, there is only way, strengthening the guard of art museum."
766,"When I heard this news story, I feel angry because the reason she commit suicide was so ridiculous. I think Australian radio hosts, Mel Greig and Michael Christian duped Mrs.Saldanha with light tempt to get top news. They must not expect their conduct would cause such a tragic accident. In the result, she felt heavy responsibility and committed suicide, with sadness of many people. Radio hosts were very thoughtless. They had to consider not only their benefits, but also feeling of people who was exploited. I hope that there will not be person like Mrs.Saldanha."
767,"I agree with the ID1243's opinion. It is true that switching prime minister doesn't change anything. Actually it just making everything slow and worse, because every prime minister says and tries different thing each time, so they never finishes what they told to us that they are going to do on the first day of prime minister."
768,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this comment. I don't feel any changes yet. These days, in Japan, the minister have changed many times, but I don't feel the changes. And I think because of it, almost of people can't expect too much of the minister."
769,"Sony failed to catch the taste of the times. And in addition to Sony, many Japanese companies are overwhelmed by the overseas companies. But I think they will be able to survive because quality of the Japanese product is superior to any other country's. Once Apple's iPod swept over the world, and Sony's WALKMAN didn't sell well. But Sony broke a deadlock by their technology. Now many companies work hard to please a user. But Japanese companies should return to origin. It is to regain 'Japanese quality' in the one and only that they must do now."
770,"I think it is inappropriate that EU win Nobel Prize. Certainly no war has happened since 60 years ago, there is many problem now, so there is possibility the safety of EU become worse. Nobel Prize shouldn't be given EU, should be given individual who tried for EU peace."
771,"I disagree with this law for two reasons. Firstly, It is hard to see this law can help artist can earn money and protect their right of creativity. I think this law will help the big art commerce company earn money rather help small artist. For example, in 1985 all the data from the American publicly-funded programmer of earth observation by the Landsat satellite were conceded to EOPSat, a subsidiary of General Motors and General Electric. As a result, the cost of access to the data increased 20 fold. Universities could no longer afford to buy the information, even though it had been obtained entirely using public money. It was used mainly for the benefit of the big oil companies, who thus received a direct subsidy. Secondly, I disagree with this law because I opposite with Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). ACTA negotiated in closed door by US, Japan, Canada and the EU. It excluded developing countries among negotiation. And European Commission was not allowed to negotiate over Article 23 -- the controversial part of the treaty which not only insists on criminal penalties for piracy but also for those accused of 'aiding and abetting' copyright infringement -- the member states had to be represented at the table. They negotiated these new criminal sanctions behind closed doors."
772,"I think vandalism occurs because of a lack of education and communication within international society. Firstly, artistic things and cultural assets are valued by public and society. People who commit vandalism usually do not recognize (approve of) the communal value of art. In many case, they give their own negative meaning to the art. Some vandalism occurs in a political way. The people who commit vandalism in a political way give their own independent meaning to cultural assets. For example, in 2001, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha in 2003, appealing to international society to accept their political will. In this case, they treat cultural assets as a means to achieve their will. Secondly, international society needs much negotiation and conversation to protect cultural assets. A cultural asset which is maintained by one country is not exclusively owned by that country. This means a cultural asset, even if technically/theoretically maintained by one country, is practically/in reality for everybody who lives on this earth, both now and in the future. According to this logic, The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict was adopted at The Hague (Netherlands) in 1954. It covers immovable and movable cultural heritage, including monuments of architecture, art or history, archaeological sites, works of art, manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest, as well as scientific collections of all kinds, regardless of their origin or ownership. But in spite of this kind of determination of international society, many cases of vandalism occur during periods of war. Because of this, I believe the actions of international society to protect humanity's cultural assets are not yet sufficient. Therefore, I propose to make a penalty that regulates vandalism during periods of war. Even though The Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict has a penalty, it has not yet been enforced because it is not realistic. For example, America plundered cultural assets of Iraq which were being kept in Iraqi museums. In spite of this crime, America has never apologized nor been punished."
773,"I think the EU does not deserve the Nobel peace prize. It is true that countries in the EU strive to unify Europe to create a peaceful civil society and work together as a political experiment to become an example for settling peace in their countries; however, this cannot be a reason for Nobel peace prize. There are two reasons for this idea. Firstly, Alfred Nobel's will specified that the prize should be given to 'the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.' But it is hard to say EU has promoted peace in other countries. Fundamentally, EU is an organization for the welfare of the people who are members of EU countries. It is true that European countries are at peace because of EU. But even though unification decreased war in Europe and made peace in the European area, EU eventually turned into a hegemony. For example, EU disregarded the demands of help from Burmese pro-democracy activists many times. They requested help from the EU because dictatorship in Burma was worsening and international society did not see the gravity of the situation even though a lot of Burmese citizens were killed or sent to prison. But EU also disregarded that problem. Also, EU is responsible for destroying the Bamyan Buddha. In 2003, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha, with the intention of appealing to international society to accept their political will and wish to negotiate with EU and UN to approve Taliban as pre-government of Afghanistan. Of course, Taliban cannot become the government of Afghanistan, and because EU and UN did not talk with them, they finally destroyed Bamyan Buddha which is precious human cultural asset. The EU and UN had to negotiate with them even though the Taliban was not recognized as the official government because they already ruled most of Afghanistan and the EU and UN needed to create a solution to protect the people of Afghanistan and the Bamyan Buddha. Secondly, the idea that EU contributed to the decline of war is wrong. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1990 to 2004, only 4 wars occurred between countries. Aside from country-to-country war, almost every other war was civil war. The decline of war is due to the flow of international politics, not because of the EU."
774,"After this judgment, many people point out freedom of expression has been damaged. Surely, this situation could be a problem of freedom of expression, which is the right that everyone should be able to say what they want, without fear of persecution. But I think pointing out focusing on only freedom of expression in this situation is out of focus. I think this situation is more of a problem of objectivity in science rather than freedom of expression. Because modern science is getting more complicated and unpredictable, the question if science is value-neutral or not has become a central point of controversy. I think science is value-neutral. Also, the point of this situation is that the Italian scientists got convicted because of communication, not science. If the scientists explained the results more minutely, people would have been able to understand the situation and prepare for the danger to the best of their ability. But the only thing the scientists said when they explained their results was that everything was 'safe'. This is the reason why people are angry. They did not explain the risks and possibilities in detail even though they knew there is no such thing as being 100 percent sure of results as a scientist. Resultingly, they did not perform their duties as scientists. Taking this incident as an example, society should change the method in which scientific decisions are communicated. As I mentioned above, science is value-neutral. Therefore, there should be lot of verification and discussion when applying scientific results which can make a huge practical influence on society. Also, civil society should verify if scientists announced the results truthfully and correctly without any political pressure. Professor Sheila Jasanoff from Harvard University who researched about scientists in law and politics said it is reasonable to investigate scientists' original results after they have been interpreted by people. For example, in 1989 scientists announced that BSE will never infect humans; therefore, many people believed their results and ate the infected beef. However, because many people died of BSE in 1990, people in England investigated the results that were announced in the same year. As a result, civil society and government of England revealed the scientists were wrong and republished the report in 2000."
775,"Barack Obama, the 44th and current President of the United States was re-elected in November 2012. Due to the conservative political environment of America which has harassed a lot of ordinary and ill-informed people who make up most of the population, President Obama won the election in 2008. Keeping the social atmosphere which helped him to win the election by a landslide in mind, he had to continue progress towards leading America towards a more prosperous and harmonious future. This more moderate view which aimed towards the betterment of the American society greatly contributed towards his victory. As a politician in a democratic country where the politicians work for the good of the people, he had to embody this message that allowed him to win the election. Also, in regards to the international aspect of the United States of America, he had to consider what policies and practices of America could impact other countries. Furthermore, upon making these policies he had to carefully put them into practice so as to not disturb the international community. In the 4 years of his first term, he made a better welfare state while simultaneously enacting better policies for the international society. For example, on the domestic front, Federal welfare spending has grown by 32 percent over the past four years, accelerated by President Obama's stimulus spending and has also swelled by a growing number of Americans whose recession-depleted income has now qualified them for public assistance. Also, he ended U.S. military involvement in the Iraq War. These kinds of actions can be praised by the public. But if we think about the message that he promoted during his campaign, we will notice that he has diverged a little from it. For example, He has worsened the war between Palestine and Israel with some careless policies, which have been characteristically repeated throughout the history of American diplomacy. He said 'There's no country on Earth that would tolerate missiles raining down on its citizens from outside its borders,' and when he made this perfectly sensible statement he was not thinking of the Palestinians in Gaza, helpless victims of Israeli bombs and missiles or in some cases bombs and missiles that were dropped or fired from F-16 fighters or Apache helicopters manufactured in the US. He never changed his political attitude or policies towards the Palestinian civilization, despite being criticized by the international community. This does not seem like the practice of the American President who won the election under the banner of peace and betterment of society. For the next 5 years, civil society, which is concerned about the prospects of the future, should urge him to choose better policies in order to create and maintain a peaceful and just world society."
776,"On April 10th 2012, Sony predicted that it would lose 520 billion yen ($6.5 billion) in the fiscal year that ends on March 31st 2013, the biggest loss in its 65-year history. Since IT is a fundamental part of the Japanese Industry, if Sony or Panasonic, the two largest IT companies in Japan, were to have an economic crisis then this situation would significantly impact the Japanese economy as a whole. Kazuo Hirai, the President and CEO of Sony Corporation, announced that the following three products: digital imaging, including cameras; gaming; and mobile phones are core to Sony. These three areas of investment are causing some major problems within the Sony budget. But I believe that these kinds of measures that aim to mitigate crises in a short period of time cannot prevent long term problems because IT industries are an area that need a lot of time to invent and market a technology. I suggest investing in basic sciences as a solution. IT industries are based on applied science and can only be progressed through the advancement of the pure or fundamental sciences. In many countries, both the Educational Policy as well as the National Policy places a lot of emphasis on the development of pure science. Consequently these countries often are the countries that have the potential to wield a lot of power within the International Community. Furthermore, this kind of condition is relatively advantageous to Japan because Japan has been increasing their power in pure science; this has been demonstrated in many papers and contests. Because of this, Japan can apply the fruits of its labor towards applied science and technology. Also, this kind of policy could be more effective because of the diligence of Japanese, which has been a great Social Capital for Japan. However, there are a lot of problems that need to be fixed in order for the Japanese industry to progress. The biggest problem that I want to point out is the ineffectiveness of the Japanese IT industry company working conditions. These companies make employees work as long as they can. That includes working extremely late into the night. Because of this, many talented engineers are hesitant towards working in Japan. This can also be applied to both Japanese companies and society. Furthermore, these kinds of working conditions are not beneficial for the creativity of the employees or the creative atmosphere of the company. The loss of creativity is especially hazardous for IT industry. Because of these reasons, the Japanese should increase their focus towards developing their scientific prowess as well as to strive to make a more accepting and creative working atmosphere. I believe that this will powerfully aid the growth of the Japanese"
777,"After I came to Japan in order to study, I found that most of my friends were educated in the West. Even though I hung out with these European and American friends for a long time, some of their attitudes and opinions still made me surprised and confused. The most frequent thing that perplexes me is the Western sense of humor, namely hoaxes and sarcasm. For the first few days of hanging out with the Westerners, I usually felt offended or even cried because of their hoaxes and sarcasm. Since I was a timid person, I did not know how to react to words that made me feel uncomfortable. Because of this reason, I could not ask them about the meaning of their seemingly pointed sense of humor, thus I just felt offended, and even blamed myself a lot. Because I had felt these kinds of negative feelings towards jokes, I felt I could totally understand and sympathize with the nurse when I first saw this article. Also, Australian radio hosts, Mel Greig and Michael Christian who posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in order to inquire about the Duchess of Cambridge's health while she was being treated at the King Edward VII hospital are obviously partly responsible for nurse's suicide. But, I don't think that these kinds of accidents can be a reason to blame hoaxes or sarcasm. Even though I was often offended by this kind of humor, these days, for me, hoaxes and sarcasm among my friends is a form of communication that makes me feel that my friends and I are connected in trust and love. When I think about it, a relationship in which this kind of humor does not offend your partner is a similar process as when two people fall in love each other. For example, my mother and father have their own hoaxes and sarcasm as an expression of love. I began to think like this at the end of last November. Since I was tired of my friend's hoaxes and sarcasm, I asked them one day when I visited their place how to distinguish sarcasm and real expression. I guess since that is hard to explain, they showed me a gesture which meant 'sarcasm' and they start to use it for me when I made an uncomfortable face. Their consideration made me feel a deep sense of camaraderie. Also, I realized that sarcasm and hoaxes among friends can be an expression of friendship. For this reason, I believe that a world without hoaxes and sarcasm is the same as a world without love. Love and humor, I believe these two things are fundamentally the same."
778,"Japan has led the world with superior technology. However, now we can not win the world competition as long as there are no new technological innovations. Japanese companies should reconsider the strategy to detect early trends in the world as well as Sony. I want to approach the world more greedy."
779,"Generally people knows predictions on earthquake is impossible. Therefore, thr\ere must be few people trusted the prediction, be little damage for society. In addition, I think these scientists didn't have ill will. There is no reason to consider them as guilty."
780,"Certainly the radio DJs did silly act and their action caused the nurse's death. But I guess they never dreamed that a person would die because of their act. So I do not think only they should be criticized. Nobody understands the boundary line of the joke. However, they insulted the Queen and 'killed' a person. So it is natural that British people get angry. I hope that this incident won't cause the fight between Australia and the U. K."
781,"I agree with the law to punish people who have downloaded films, CDs, data illegally because I think 'copyrights' should be protected more carefully to reduce the worldwide crimes, and also to save the profits of the makers. I know that it is quite clear to have perfect provision for stopping illegal downloading. However there we should all think about this problem more , and find out the solutions and how to carry it out."
782,"I agree to Michael Halpern's term, 'Scientists need to be able to share what they know----and admit what they do not know----without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not come true.' Because, we can know various problems and solutions by the action of scientists."
783,I think Mr.Obama's re-election is good and important for not only U.S.A. but also Japan and many countries. I expect him for economical and political problems.
784,I was sad to hear this news. Two DJs' careless action caused such a tragic incident. They should be responsible for that took the life of one person and given severe punishment even as a joke. I think the nurse committed suicide because she felt a responsibility. Duchess of Cambridge must have been shocked as well.
785,"I think Obama's re-erection have good influence especially Japan. Actually, When Obama erected as American president last time, I was surprised. And this time, too. I would like Obama be erected, but Romney had strong power especially on white, so I was glad to hear this news Obama's re-erection. The reason is that Obama feel more and more friendship with Japan, so I think it is meaningful for us. Japan would be able to make a solid background on the relationship in Asia. Japan which don't have army needs American power, I think."
786,"This is less a vote for the LDP than a vote against the DPJ and their failure to live up to their promises in their so called 'manifesto'. One problem is that Ishinnokai, Ishihara's and Hashimoto's party very well could win more seats than the DPJ which is an even bigger problem waiting in the wings. I've talked to a number of people about this election and many see no option other than the LDP which will bring back an era of unbridled public spending. I also think there are a lot of vote against the DPJ, and many people seems to have thought there was no reliable party other than LDP. But I think the situation that Ishinnokai won many seats isn't problem. At the present time, Ishinnokai is unreliable party. But I think this party will stimulate other parties including the DPJ and the LDP. I think that appearance of Ishinnokai may be a chance to change politics of Japan. Though I don't know whether it changes better or worse."
787,"Everyday I hear, read, talk about many news, however this is one of the worst news I've heard recently. As many people already have said, this is such an awful news. The man has spoiled an important cultural heritage that should be protected forever. I don't understand why this man has done such a stupid thing.... Guess so many people all over the world is feeling the same way. The man wasn't educated enough...I think. Enough to have the idea to protect heritages. Anyways, I really hope that this wall paintings somehow will be fixed someday."
788,"When I first heard that the EU have earned a novel peace prize, I was really surprised. The reason is that the EU has played an important role during the war and also did good job to end it. However, now, the EU is having a lot of problems in economies, relationships, and so on. It is true that countries in the EU tried to unify and made some effort to do good politics. However when we think about whether EU has promoted 'Peace' to the other countries, I can' t help saying no to this question. The Nobel peace prize should be given to the one who strives to promote peace all other the world. In this meaning, I don't think that the EU is appropriate for the prize to be given."
789,"'tmarie Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:47PM JST Japan is its own worst enemy. When, when, when will they learn??' I was interested in this comment. Prime minister changes 7th times in 6 years in Japan. It is very serious problem. I hope Abe will conduct stable and reliable politics for people."
790,"Michael Halpern said, 'Scientists need to be able to share what they know--and admit what they do not know--without the fear of being criminally responsible should their predictions not come true.' I think this is true, and this is the ideal type of the scientists. They should be brave enough to tell their predictions to save people. However this is only an ideal and it's clear that not everybody can be like this.....or maybe no one can be. Who would like to take a risk to say wrong things in public? To solve this problem, I recommend to make a environment that one can easily say their thoughts aloud."
791,"When I read this article, I was shocked because I knew that Japanese companies are downgraded and it's now in a fear of extinction but I never knew that it's because Japanese companies have been focusing the device market, but now it does not required, the most required stuff is a platform like a hotspot. This information was totally new to me. I felt like I understood about the economy more. I don't have the sense of economies so I can't say smart things about this, however the one thing that I want to say about this, is that Japanese companies need to be more active and positive. If they do nothing in fear of failure, nothing will never change. I expect them to succeed and play an active part in the world."
792,"I disagree with this law. I'm doubtful whether illegal downloads caused shrinking of music market in Japan. Even if that is true, the law has problem that the number of people who subject to prosecution is thought to be too large, and that it is too difficult to identify the criminals. It has been three months since the law was enforced, but I've never heard the story either that anyone has arrested on charge of illegal download, nor that CD sales has recovered."
793,"I thought there was an unexpectedly large margin in the results of the vote. Obama probably won back his popularity by dealing with the approaching storm appropriately. The treatment reminds me of the great earthquake in East Japan, which Mr.Kan, the Prime Minister at the time couldn't cope with. And also Obama's attitude toward diplomacy might be supported by many people. I guess his mind was occupied with leaving achievements for the re-election. I want him to concentrate his energy on leaving achievements that remain in history."
794,"When I first read this story, I couldn't understand what was happening. Who can think that a woman die because of just one call of the journalists? Also, she didn't say anything bad......like a national secret!!!! I thought DJ was silly, but at the same time I feel really sorry for him. He did a stupid thing, but it was not so bad that he should be responsible for a woman's death. I wonder why this lady committed a suicide.......even a trusted servant of the king would not do the same thing,"
795,"The reason why the new law is established is the recording industry has suffered serious losses because of illegal downloads. The important thing is to protect rights of copyright holders. Make people be convinced that reproducing valuable contents freely hurts makers is also important. I think adding a special favor to CDs, a ticket of the singer's concert, for example, is one of effective ways."
796,"bruinfanDEC. 16, 2012 - 09:23PM JST I knew the the LDP would gain seats, but I thought that there would be a little more balance. Way to go selfish (older) voters...People over 60 already control 90% of Japan's wealth. This imbalance will just get worse as younger workers pay for older retired people (collecting on ave. an excess of ¥39,620,000 in pension benefits above what they paid in). Also who will fight the battles that Abe will hope to start? I think this comment is one truth of Japan nowadays. The most of people voted was over 60. So, old people have politician right more than young people…, but who lead Japan's future is young people. I would like Abe take the reins of government for not only getting many votes but also bringing up Japan's future. Of course, young people should vote more and more activity not to be ignored."
797,Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought I agree with this comment. I have no interest in politics and I know that recent young people have tendency to have lower interest in it. So this 59% was a little shock for me. I thought the turnout would be more low number.
798,"This news made me sad. Though they didn't intend to do a serious mischief, I thought it couldn't be settled simply. It is because a hoax call developed into a big incident that generated a suicide. A strict measure should be adopted in order not to prevalent jokes that has gone far. However there are some people who should be pursued the issue of responsibility, producers who allowed the hoax call, for example."
799,"I felt sad when I read this article. Museums must be filled with a lot of guards for preventing such foolish acts? If so, I feel sorry for people who really love art because they would not like to enjoy works of art surrounded by many obstacles."
800,"Since I had thought that Nobel Prize is to be given to individuals, so this news surprised me, but I think EU deserves that Prize. This is because It is true that there have been no war in Europe for over a half-century, and Nobel Peace Prize have been given to non-individuals several times."
801,"I strongly oppose to the sentence. It is natural that companies which neglect to confirm security of their products are punished for the accidents which caused by their product, but earthquake is natural disaster, so there's no one who responsible for it. Seismologists should be appreciated when they predicted earthquakes, but they should not be punished or blamed when they couldn't predict earthquakes."
802,"Using smartphone and iDevices, I felt that customer's experience matter these days too, but this doesn't simply mean that Sony can't recover, I think. Sony's technological strength should be genuine, so what they have to do is catching the trend and creative idea. By the way,I think CM of Xperia aiming too high to understand."
803,"What a tragedy. I wonder how strong sense of responsibility she had. The DJs' act should not be forgiven. Judging from the significance of the matter, whether they intended to or not is not important, and their acts are no humor. ."
804,"Shamhei SakaiDEC. 16, 2012 - 11:37PM JST Chill guys. There'll be another election next year... and the year after.... and the year after that.... I reluctantly agree with this sarcasm. I wonder how many people in foreign country know who is the current prime minister of Japan.."
805,"In the article it is said as below, 'The truth has turned out to be more powerful than that. Devices are merely servants, connected to the broadband networks that more than three-quarters of US homes have, or wirelessly connected to the home networks or coffee shop hotspots that have doubled in use since tablets came around. A platform world teaches us this truth: it's not the device that matters, it's not even the connected device that matters. It's the connected experience that matters'. What is said here maybe true to some extent but it doesn't' t hold true to this context, the falling of Sony. Yes, I can understand that the connected experiences is very important to achieve demand from the customers, and SNS and digital platforms such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft have succeeded in meeting with people's demands. However, the declining of Sony and other Japanese electronic device making companies are due to other factors. Firstly, it is due to globalization which has made the cost competition severe. As you know, as the globalization prevail our world, how cheap you produce the product and how well you sell them are very crucial for the survival. This will lead to fundamental problem that some Japanese companies are facing. That is, high yen rate made it difficult for Japanese companies' exporting their products. Because the rate of yen is so high and the cost of the Japanese products systematically get higher, people in other countries doesn't purchase them. In other words, the Japanese products are not meeting the demands of buyers. On the other hand, Samsung is cheaper than Japanese ones and well made than Chinese ones, which is meeting the demands of customers so that's why it is growing. So as you can see, these kind of economic factors take an important role on whether the company will prosper or fail."
806,"It is very deplorable for the death of the nurse, Mrs Saldanha. I fell so sorry for her and I hope she will be rewarded in the heaven. So what's the problem in this issue? The death of a young lady? The hoax made by two journalists? Yes, I believe that these are very important issue that must be discussed but the problem that I would like to write here is more fundamental. The problem here is that there are many people who are waiting to hear the private issue of the individuals which they do not need to hear or waiting for the kind of news such as gossip of the celebrities. In other words, the fundamental problem lying under this issue is that there is a demand for the matters which they don't need to know. If there is a huge demand for those topics, the information will be sold at high prices and journalists or paparazzi will try to get some information about those people by any means. So this issue is about the moral of the people in the today's world. In case of Princess Diana, she died in the accident because of the paparazzi. Now, the innocent female died because of the journalists. There are many other cased that has caused death only because there are demands. So what we can do? Maybe, we need to reconsider about our daily life and be responsible for our every day acts."
807,"Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27AM JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion in terms of 'I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon'. In the election, most people didn't vote for the manifest of LDP. People voted just as the result of eliminating other parties. Also, the truth is that the LDP didn't make progression on increasing their votes rather the votes are split among other parties such as Ishin-no-kai or Democratic Party. Another realities we must face is that the voting rate of young generations are declining. Here underlies the problem. Unless the nations decided what direction they wanted the country to go on, we cannot improve our country and, in the end, it will become corrupted. So more and more people, particular young people, need to have more interests in the politics, economics and social affairs and think more, discuss more for the future of Japan. Don't be passive. Be active."
808,"Even if I didn't support all of Noda's thinking, there was some hope left, somehow. Not anymore. At least a lot of things are clearer now. Japan is on the wrong path for good. It's people will suffer even more and for nothing but the well being of the politicians and their amakudari friends. Sad day for Japan. I really wonder how the LDP voters will react in the next months... desperate and disillusioned. I agree with that comment. It has passed only 3 years form the Minshuto won the election. 3 years is too short to evaluate them. For changing the regime and systems and something else, 3 years is not enough. Above all, a lot of wrong things that LDP had caused for so long time needs more time to be cured. The only thing I do is to believing that LDP is changed."
809,"This news made me sad. We want to be only happy for the well beings, but because of that incident we could not to do that. I think DJs did not mean it harm, they meant it was just mischief. But they are public and has some influence, they has to have responsibility to their behavior."
810,"Characters are one of the most important cultural aspects which make what we are. So we should worry more about the loss of writing skills of kanji because it could be a 'identity crisis'. We have a responsibility to save the culture which still remains, and pass down it to posterity."
811,"Even police wants to control illegally download with regulations, the way of illegally download is progressing more, which the regulations cannot cover it. We must change the offenders' senses with preparing the regulations."
812,"It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon This comment seems a little radical, but I agree. Looking back on these years, what party and who assume the reins of government doesn't matter. I myself don't take side with one party. Whether or not the election was end in success is judged a few years later."
813,"Japanese should write kanji more.I have to learn to read and write more.Japanese identity is lost.We need to reaffirm the goodness of our culture.It's not an easy thing, we do not have to work."
814,"I hope two companies, Sony and Panasonic, overcome this situation. These companies have very big influence in Japan for economy, and so on. So these companies should be recovered immediately, and thereby Japanese economy will come out of big slump, I think."
815,"Sony was a presence that leads the world,Sony was a presence that leads the world.Since the Japanese economy would fall into a crisis situation by Sony bankruptcy,Sony should make a great solution to overcome this situation as soon as possible."
816,"I didn't believe and felt sad when I heard this news. Two DJs actions were very foolish and unbelievable as human beings. I hope that the incident like this will never occur in all over the world, and want they to apologize to nurse and her families and all of her colleagues."
817,"DJ is the bad in this case.The nurse is not bad, it is not to be criticized for the act.She is just an effort to quickly convey accurate information to the royal family.This person should be a atone for the rest of one's life."
818,"I think the EU should not be awarded the Nobel Prize.EU scale is too large.EU does not bring economic development.Gap in Europe is larger.When the EU was able to redress the economic disparity, I admit their Nobel Prize."
819,"Measures against cyber crime in Japan is always late.That copyright is violated, the singer income decreases.There is a need to avoid such a situation."
820,"SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49PM JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). I think it is very nice comment to the result of this election. I think also that it is the important problem that small turnout of young people. This is cause of disparity in the number of voters per representation. The government should do many efforts for the young people to vote the election, I think."
821,"I think that the presidential election was a tough situation, Obama's approval rating is lowered. However, he was able to win the election because responded to severe hurricane damage immediately. I think it is an indication that expects to enhance the social welfare of the people to America's first black president in the unequal society progresses."
822,I think these researchers very poor.It is difficult to predict natural phenomena.I think this decision is wrong.
823,"Although illegal download is crime, I fear that the chance to listen to music will decrease. The assess to trial listening should be retained."
824,I was surprised to hear the news. An action like this doesn't be forgiven. The museum should reinforce the security. and remedy the painting as soon as possible.
825,"Certainly the European Union is trying to change Europe and the world in a peaceful way, the way to understand this isn't only one, the news showed. EU hasn't achieved the real peace yet because each country doesn't turn them face toward the same direction."
826,I was shocked to hear the news. Science doesn't have absolute perfection. No one doesn't fail. Scientists shouldn't be criticized and we shouldn't depend on only science.
827,"Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:10PM JST This is less a vote for the LDP than a vote against the DPJ and their failure to live up to their promises in their so called 'manifesto'.One problem is that Ishinnokai, Ishihara's and Hashimoto's party very well could win more seats than the DPJ which is an even bigger problem waiting in the wings.I've talked to a number of people about this election and many see no option other than the LDP which will bring back an era of unbridled public spending. The expectation of the citizen to the Democratic Party government was betrayed while distrust of politics rose in economic recession and territorial problem. I think the landslide victory of the Liberal Democratic Party while a new political party is full to be because there was not a choice rather than trust it in the Liberal Democratic Party."
828,Congratulations! I'm glad to hear the news. America is the country that connects closely with Japan. It will be easier to conduct foreign relations if the same person becomes the president. I wish Japan could be the same.
829,"I hope SONY and Panasonic overcome this situation. The share at japan increases foreign company, Apple and Microsoft. The situation also occurs in smartphone market. Iphone gets popularity. So domestic maker's share has decreased. In order to overcome this situation, they have to create new technology and i believe they can do."
830,It is difficult for me to decide who are guilty. I think that this affairs are responsible for not only the two DJs but also the radio company and others around them. A nurse at centre of duchess of Cambridge are killed by hoax call is very sad. But i think that she could not put up with to bring about detail.
831,"Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 08:52PM JST 41% voted... pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. I agree with this comment. I was suppressed this 41% voted. This percentage is the worst number after WWⅡ. Recently, Japan have so many complicated problems. For example, island dispute, nuclear power plant, deficit financing, and revival of west japan. But, people who participated in the election was only 41% of Japanese! This is regrettable situation. I am worried about future of this country."
832,"I was shocked to hear the news. The nurse shouldn't be criticized and commit suicide. Two DJs don't bear all responsibility. Direction has to be admitted to some extent. But in this case, it is over. They had to disclose the secret of a trick."
833,"Sony slipped back, this matter is so disappointing. But, I think it is natural. At once time, Japanese technology was highly regarded. But, recently, South Korea's development is truly remarkable. And,American corporation, for example Apple.inc's products are fascinating the world.Japan have to win South Korea and America for development.It is so difficult. I think, Japanese corporations doesn't have the ability to make new idea."
834,I agree with bruinfan. Whether a party wins or loses depends on the old. So each party tries to attract them affection. Policy tends to ignore the young and they become indifferent. This is the problem. Young people should have interest and the government should strive to attract them.
835,"I'm happy to Obama was reelected US president. I support Obama. I believe this thing give Japan good effect. Sometimes, He is criticized for the mass media. But, I want to hold out him."
836,I was shocked for reading this article. I can realize the greatness of Obama. I think his policy is so novelty. His policy brings much happiness for many people. I believe it.
837,Shinzo Abe was disappointingly lost his position. But he returned with strength and cleverness. I think he is the only person who can improve Japanese politics and strengthen Japan. I expect him for economic recovery that the other parties couldn't achieve.
838,"Nathaw at Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33AM JST &gt;Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with the opinion. LDP economic policy lean toward economic growth and employment. They believe that if Japanese economy grows such as rapid economic growth, we can escape the deflationary spiral. But it is really impossible. No developed country grows 10% GDP. In order to grow economy, LDP is about to redeem government bonds and increase the deficit. By now though Japanese government reduce the deficit, LDP will add to it with Japanese center bank. I am worried about Japanese future."
839,i expect him to succeed. i believe him.
840,"This re-election may reflects the hope of American people to him. They dissatisfied with his economic measures now, so I expect him to change that in the future."
841,"I was really shocked to hear the news. The nurse was doing her best. The one who tricked her should be punished strictly. Although the nurse should not have leaked the information, she could not distinguish the radio DJ from the one she thought. As some of the commentator mentioned, ordinary people cannot pay attention to distinguish it. I hope this kind of thing wont happen again."
842,"I was sad to hear this news. The nurse should not have killed herself. I read this news in other articles, and they says that she had a strong sense of responsibility, was trusted by the people around her, according to them. In my personal feelings, I pray for the repose of her. And I think the two DJs should be pursued their responsibilities. DJ is a position which they must take responsibility for their own speaking and behaving, and DJ have strong influences to the mass. All the people who can influence many people must not forget it."
843,"I agree with the award because EU prevent a big war between countries in Europe.However, if one country has economic crisis, a lot of country will be infuluenced.This is a defect about Eu. As many people know, Greece has had economic crisis and country around Greece were damaged too."
844,"Six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information."
845,Obama's re-election is the good news. I think being elected again shows peoples' confidence or expectations. And I hope this re-election bring some good changes to Japan.
846,"I think this punishment is surprising and I don't agree on it. It's impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs precisely. If that decision were correct, reporters of the whether forecast must quit their jobs."
847,I don't know that it is good news for Japan.America must decrease amount of money to militally.The nation's finances are bankrupt because of the war.
848,We can imagine but we don't or will never know how the world without EU would go on and what would happen there. So I cannot know what eurosceptics say. They should recognize the value of the presence and contribution toward peace of EU.
849,"When I read the news, I was really surprised and shocked. It was sad to hear that lots of people were died 'cause of the earthquake, believing the words of the scientists that the place was free from the fear of the earthquake. But, think again. Can u believe the words of them 100percent? Let us recall the casualty which happened in Japan on 11th Mar. 2011. Most of us believed that the nuclear plant was safe even if the earthquake happened. But actually...it was not. So, even the scientists or experts cannot completely expect what's gonna happen. I do not wanna say that we should not believe in them 'cause of such thing. I just feel we cannot say their words are not 100 percent correct. However, it is obvious that we are relying on science nowadays. If we restrict the freedom of the speech of the scientists, we cannot make use of them. So such thing should not be happened although they cannot predict all the thing."
850,"I want Sony, Panasonic and Sharp to over come this hard situation. They are ones of the biggest company in Japan, and they influence economies not only in Japan but also all over the world. Therefore, I think that they have key of escaping from this severe business slowdown in Japan. These three overcoming will make good times in Japan and the world."
851,"I don't think we Japanese have to use kanji. kanji makes Japanese so difficult for foreign people, and less and less people become Japanese-phobia. It's true that it's bad young Japanese don't write kanji,but it's not necessarily bad phenomenon."
852,"I strongly believe that Sony should consider the customer and market. now, SAMSUNG is rising rapidly. SAMSUNG's products is certainly more cheaper than Sony. So Sony depended on its bland. But what is important is that company make the product which customer want to buy. Not only function but also design is necessary. Furthermore, Sony is forestalled when company make new product or technology. So this company slipped back. Of course, when we hear this is Sony product, we feel that this product is safe and functional. However, now is the time when there is a condition that products is safe, as I said, when customer compare products, they see the design. so Sony too depend on its bland."
853,"I could not believe this news when I first watched it on TV. This decision is as incoherence as 'fen shu keng ru'(this means 'burning books on the Chinese classics and burying Confucian scholars alive'), which the first emperor of China did. I didn't think such a crazy sentence was passed in the present, scientific time."
854,"I think that Japanese company is not thriving now. Instead of famous Japanese company such as Sony and Panasonic are not flourishing , in the world foreign big company such as apple and Samsung are rapidly developing. I am using iPhone5 made in apple,i am not using Japanese cell phone. In the world,Japanese phones are disappearing. I think that it is very important for Japanese company to deplore the new fields."
855,"I heard about that news. Less we write Kanji, less we can use Kanji. However, it's an inevitable situation. Because we have abandoned things which we didn't need to use."
856,"After the law which restricts free music download proclaimed, many people in Japanese continued free downloading. I think it should be reinforced."
857,"I think Nobel peace prize in the wonderful award in the world. Also EU has a right to get this award because they control European countries peacefully. This is not easy thing to do. Still now, many wars are happening around the world and many people died because of wars which make no sense. From this news, I hope people should notice about how wonderful peace is and try to make world better than now."
858,I think this result shows that Japanese people can be affected and change their mind easily. Because we chose Democratic Party to promote good economy. This Liberal democratic Party's victory caused by our expectation to promote Japanese economy.
859,I can't understand how the criminal feel about his action. It is not forgiven. And we have to defend that action .
860,I can't understand how the criminal feel about his own action. It is not forgiven. And all art museums have to take measures to prevent such actions never occuring.
861,This news is good for the world because he mention about economy especially reducing unemployment.It will be good for our economy. He couldn't do that this 4 Years but I believe he can do it. I want Japanese government to cooperate the U.S. and make a good relationship for Japan.
862,"It is pleasing that EU received Nobel peace prize. However, EU has a lot of problems which have to be solved immediately. For example, it is financial crisis. Once it occur in any country in EU, it spread all over EU countries. We have to think of the both advantages and disadvantages."
863,"People buy CDs because they are a fan of the singer or the group. Although there is a law to stop illegal downloading, I don't think those who download music will buy the CD.So this law would not stop the fall of the CD sales and to make CDs sold, music artists should work more to increase there fans.Lastly the most thing that I think is providing people not buy CDs are that CDs are too expencive.They should be sold at a more reasonable price."
864,"wanderlust Dec. 17, 2012 - 02:11AM JST Naoto Kan was PM for 14 months. I don't think Abe will last a year, the LDP are probably already deciding who will be next in the big seat, when the new PM's popularity will drop to around 20%, as it inevitably will.... I don't think so. The strong yen rate is being redressed and the price of stocks is rising. I suppose this fact proves that the policy or the executive power of LDP are expected. To be sure, Mr.Abe relinquished government about five years ago. But we should estimate the new government after seeing how they're working. There are, indeed, a little anxiety in my mind."
865,"It is impossible to predict when and where earthquake occur perfectly. We know that after the big earthquake hit Tohoku and Kanto area in Japan in 3.11. Therefore, it is strange to press all responsibility against scientists who could not predict the earthquake completely."
866,"When Obama was elected as American president 4 years ago, American people was so delighted and hoped that he would change the country. And, certainly, Obama solved some problem in and out of America. However, the situation is different from first election. The situation will be more difficult than then. It is worth seeing how Obama will change the world again."
867,"We have no means of predicting natural phenomena completely. If people were able to make an accurate of natural phenomena, we would not be sustained any damage caused by catastrophes. The Italian scientists should have admitted their underestimating and offered a comment on it modestly. After all, no matter how detailed they know about nature, there are no methods to predict disasters. If scientists are afraid of being censured about wrong predictions, the number of seismologists may be on the decline."
868,I'm interested in politics but I don't know much about it. I just hope Japan and U.S will cooperate each other more and contribute to peace of the world.
869,"It's the sad news but I think the nurse isn't wrong at all.The hospital should protect the information about patients, especially famous people. Of course, I don't think DJs are not bad, but her action had no responsibility. I don't think she had to die, but there are a big responsibility, such a punishment."
870,"sveinnyvesDec. 17, 2012 - 12:16AM JST unbelievable.... made me very worried with Japan's future... I believe Abe's Liberal-Democratic Party's winning. Because I think Japanese politics system had been successful by the leading party 'LDP'. So our country has already been the specifications for LDP. I think the problem LDP couldn't resolve isn't able to be resolved by other party. So I'll aid the LDP."
871,"UpgrayeddDec. 16, 2012 - 11:07PM JST I'm just glad that Japan isn't going to renounce nuclear power. Oh and the whole LDP inflation target thing is a pretty solid idea too. I support this opinion. Japan has so far been dependent on nuclear power. Now, it cannot be lost.It is little although there is also a method of alternative energy. So,Japan must depend on nuclear power."
872,"This is a difficult problem I think. As Internet society developing, we have come not to buy CDs. Actually we don't have to buy it any longer because we can get and listen songs we like via Internet. Once we know that, it's difficult to stop doing that. So I don't think the new law is reasonable."
873,"I think that Abe Shinzo is very lucky. When he was a prime minister,he formerly resigned the job for his health problem reason. Regardless of his previous failure, he did the LDP leader and Japanese people voted not the DPJ but the LDP. It is very important for him and the LDP to solve the domestic problems such as the economic problem,the financial problem,the educational problem and the diplomatic problem. In addition, I think that existence of the third parties will be key. Cooperating The Nipponishin party and the Minna party with the DPJ will enable the LDP stimulate."
874,"Frankly speaking, I do not have Mr Obama's good impression. Because Japan is having the TPP problem which Obama brought about. I disagree with TPP participation. It is true that TPP participation will make Japan cause the competitions among Japanese companies and get cheap goods but it may make Japanese people of agricultural and medical fields ruin. Obama is clinging obstinately to Japanese TPP participation negotiation. When he was fighting in U.S.A. president election, I was deeply impressed by his having insisted TPP problems in order to collect more votes."
875,"I think that it is very important for us to approve and protect this law now. In Japan,the concept of 'copyright' is clearly made much of by Japanese people than foreign people. It is true that I am enjoying the benefits of pirate versions but punishing lawbreakers and regulating the present situation will improve the music and video sales."
876,"I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is true that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe. For example, Europe considers itself the cradle of human rights and democracy, has called for protection of human rights to other countries but if you wear a covering Burka called European Muslims will be fined penalties. Construction of a mosque with a minaret not allowed in countries such as Switzerland. Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored."
877,"Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later. I agree this comment. In Japan president change like once a year and I don't understand why president change so much. I think it is meaningless even if the president change."
878,"Some students have said that they hope that Sony and Panasonic overcome the current situation and catch up to the company, called 'digital platforms' in the article. However, I think that it is unfortunately too late to achieve this any more. I insist this because I do not think that many Japanese people have necessarily need of the electronic products made by these companies. For example, an iPhone from Apple is now the best seller of smartphones in Japan even though we have a large number of Japanese-made mobile phones. Also, I remember that we used to utilize Japanese search engines such as 'Yahoo Japan!,' but currently it is common for everyone to use Google for any information research. Considering these, it is not impossible, but must be very difficult for Sony and Panasonic to survive the 'technology company competition.'"
879,"Like some people said above, I think that Jacintha Saldanha did not have to commit a suicide even though she was criticized a lot. She probably blamed herself too much for what she has done, but there must have been a way she could be forgiven and make amends for her work(not even a guilt). I not understand why DJs who gave a hoax call have not received any punishment even though they only 'apologized.'"
880,"To be honest, I am not very good at politics and do not quite understand how the current system of the government runs. However, I can see a ridiculousness in frequent president change in Japan. Because of this, we Japanese citizens are always confused and worried about our country's future. Plus, It is a problem that every time we have a different one, he is somewhere criticized and demanded. I would like to insist here that the Japanese government does not have even a second to waste by disputing inside the country. Otherwise, Japan will definitely stop developing and be left behind by other countries in the world."
881,"this election is big news for all over the world. i hope Mr,Obama do good job and also japan and America have a better international relations."
882,"I guess predicting earthquake is very difficult because it is natural disaster. Even if the technology developed conveniently, i think we never know about natural disaster. it is ridiculous sentencing seismologists for underestimating the risk of the earthquake."
883,"Shinzo Abe became the seventh prime minister in 6 years.This must be an awful number and to make Japan change,I think time is needed.You can't do anything that turns out to be positive in a short time and people must wait a little for the thing to happen.It isn't that easy to change the country we must know that.We don't know what would happen to Abe but we must trust him to make Japan change."
884,"I like Obama's way of speaking and was happy to hear this news.He speaks very powerfully and I have many things to learn from him.I don't know well about America's politics but since America is the strongest country in the world, he makes a good affect around the world."
885,"I think no one can predict when the earthquake happens therefore, the scientist don't need to take the responsibility."
886,I voted on his party so I want him to go for it. He quit prime minister once in pass and now he has a second chance and he can not fail this time.
887,"I am happy to hear this news because, I think Obama is better than Romney."
888,"Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27PM JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced... China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I agree with his thoughts. First of all, diplomacy is one of the most important things that Abe should deal with, there are a lot of problems in Japan though. I hope that Japan will solve the territorial dispute between not only China also Korea. It is a frequent occurrence which one country has a dispute with neighbor country. So, I believe these three countries will get over the insignificant and meaningless dispute without any wars and without any blood. I don't know how, but I wish, just having a conversation. We have to have a conversation about the territory with honor and tolerance. Besides, I disagree with the policy which nuclear power plant will not halt even in the future. Although it is not good that just says 'Stop the nuclear power plant', these people do not consider how to product huge power by other ways. If we want to halt it, we have to suggest the new way in the substitution for nuclear. However, this is very difficult question. There are a lot of earthquake and volcano in Japan. I think geothermal power generation is good for the substitution for the nuclear. Or I wish someone hit on a good idea. By the way, People who voted to LDP did not think LDP was good for the ruling party. They thought DPJ was too bad and they voted to LDP because they did not have any other choices. Recently, I have seen the new presidents in America and Korea and I think it is also better for Japan to elect a president. It is because there is no charismatic Prime Minister and people who became PM in these days would not decide anything. So, we are requiring a person who can decide various things."
889,"Related to this news, I've also heard the news that competitive positions of Japanese electronics manufacturers such as Sony, Toshiba and Panasonic in the world are weakening year by year by contrast with Korean manufacturers such as Samsung and LG. What made the difference of them? One reason is the difference of the governments' protection. Korean government protected some growing companies like Samsung by reducing a corporation tax. I think Japanese government should do so as soon as possible. I know it's the only solution of this problem, of course. However, it is certain that this way is the useful one. Anyway, I want Japanese manufacturers to revive again."
890,"I don't know the name 'Rothko' but I hear he is one of the modern artists like Picasso.Thinking about the witness, I guess how surprised he was when he saw the vandalism! I wonder why the vandal did this act. I read that he is one of the Rothko's fans.Did he love the art too match to damage the picture like the man in ' Kinkaku-ji' which is written by Yukio Mishima?"
891,"I expect of him. He declared to improve the market, and acted actually. I think the most priority policy is about the market.Many problem ; diplomacy,constitution,nuclear power,etc. should be put off. In place of DPJ, LDP have to advance Japan."
892,"It is good news for Japan.Mr.Obama treat Japan in friendly.Japan has problem about military base in Futenma.During Obama's government continues, Japan should solve it."
893,"Freedom of science must be assured by governments. But this is thing that we must criticize. And the science of earthquake and other disaster may save a lot of lives. When I read this news, I remind the day of 311. I think tremendous numbers of people could save their lives. Government must restrict the freedom of science, This news is out of problem. And I hope such thing must not happen in the future."
894,"I don't know what happened there when I first watched the same news on TV because I've never heard such a sad affair. All I can do for this is praying for the response of her soul, and wishing the affairs like this would never happen again."
895,"I was really surprised to hear the news because his kind of news doesn't occur in Japan. Tate Gallery must remedy the situation. It's true that criminal is bad, but the gallery must strengthen the security."
896,"I think that both Obama and Romney had done their best, but as the article says, Obama had succeeded in gaining votes from black, Latinos, young ages and so on. But still, it is also true that the president have many difficulties that he has to confront with. As the article says, action on the deficit will require a 'grand bargain' with Congress and that means the Republican party, which retained control of the House of Representatives, though Democrats remain in charge in the Senate. The risk for Obama is that, for all his renewed talk of bipartisan co-operation, he might be thwarted by all too familiar gridlock. Anyway, we Japanese also have to keep an eye on how the US will sail their ship because its decision of the route will affect our country and the stream of the world."
897,"Certainly, LDP won the election and the party will roll Japan again. However, I doubt if People in Japan are hopeful about the party. I think they voted for it negatively. It means we can no more entrust DPJ with politics. LDP will be faced many problems to solve."
898,"This is surprising news to me. It is because bullying has become one of the biggest problems recently in Japan, too. As I see the opinions which my classmates wrote, some of them said the nurse was to blame. However, I don't think so. The male and female DJs are to blame. It is because the meaning of words depends not the intention of person who made the comment but how it is received by the listener. It also depends on the situation where conversation occur. In this situation, they could expected what they did did harm to her, if they could not expect her death. And they had to have responsibility on their comments because their comments are broadcast around the world."
899,"Japanese strong yen, which is restoring by degree, affected Japanese export and Japanese manufactured goods are not sold. And Japan has lost its economical power which is said to be the most significant around the world. In accord with it, Japanese big companies, for example, SONY, TOSHIBA, PANASONIC, have become weaker and weaker. However, I don't think that strong yen is only blame on the situation where their goods have lost popular around the world. There are many tasks they have to solve. First, Korean companies, for example, Samsung, can make goods which have the same quality as ones made in Japan for cheaper place. Second, they can't make innovative products. Apple has made many innovative products and they were successful. If they can't make their products innovative as they were in these days, they can't regain their power."
900,"Today, many products made in other countries are in our Japanese lifestyle.You can see many people who use cellphone or laptops which are made by Apple or Samsung in this university .And I also use Apple's cellphone,too. There was a 'belief' which goods made in Japan are safer than product made in Korea, China and so on. Unfortunately for Japanese companies, this thought may have gone away. This 'made in Japan' belief has supported Japanese Company so much.Of course, Sony was helped by this,too. Now,Samsung or other companies now have technique which can make products by low costs .And these products are as good as Sony's goods. What should Sony do to thrive?In Japan,it is not easy to cut down much of personnel cost.I think Sony should try to continue to make products more fascinating for the customers."
901,"I think that the re-election is meaningful for Japan and America. As everyone knows, he has a great power, so I think would make the economies of America as well as Japan better."
902,I think that the news which LDP won the election is good for Japan even though a great number of people including me think LDP would not change a lot. I did not want DPJ to continue anymore because it had not changed the things.
903,"This news story looks common story of fraud.But this news is important because this made people know problems of journalism. Of course, this news is important.So this should be known by people and journalists have duty to report.BUt this news made me think about way of reporting. Are there any other way which doesn't let the nurse kill herself?The journalists should understand risk to make people who is reported feel sad . But reporters are needed to criticize the guilt of involved people.It is difficult to balance between criticizing and thinking about the people who is reported.The first ability which is needed for journalists is this way of balancing."
904,"I wanted Mr.Obama to win the election, so I felt relieved to hear Obama's win. It may be so difficult to achieve goal he has displayed, but to displaying goal itself is meaningful. Above all for changing something, it needs many times. He might not be able to meet views of citizens perfectly, but I think, American citizens have to leave him more time. It can say to Japanese politics. In Japan there are so many elections and so many changing our tops. This is one of the reasons that though there are so many problems left, politician couldn't the solutions. We have to study from another countries elections and politics."
905,"I thought that Obama should have been elected, and now I think it is better to come it true. Mainly, their support base. That of Obama is, poor people and minorities including non-white people, gays and so on. On the other hand, that of Romney is wealthy people and, so to speak, majorities. I think if Romney would be elected, discrimination of races and minorities and distinctions between the wealthy and the poor would increase, not only in US but also globally, needless to say in Japan. We should pay attention to the result of a narrow margin, but a primary factor that made Obama win is authorizing equal marriage for gay couples, I think."
906,"41% voted... pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. We have to be more serious about this circumstance that the rate of voting is too low. I think that this opinion is the very thought people around the world have. They look us like this. Japanese must not take it easy as we are not concerned about politics. Particularly young people should go to vote in this age of a declining birthrate and aging population. Like this comment, Japan will be ruined if things are going on."
907,"There are many issues in the case. In the issues, I will talk about two points; moral and responsibility. Firstly, in this case, two DJs lacked a sense of morality. They cannot distinguish what they can do with what they must not do. There may be people who condemned the nurse because the nurse leaked a secret. But this hoax is vicious. There are programs in which people imitate famous people. However, though these programs don't influence work place that people who are played a hoax work, this hoax influenced. This hoax is same as imposture. If so, we cannot condemn the nurse. Secondly, cooperation has to have a responsibility. After the case occurred, CEO of the radio company told the public that this hoax is not illegal. But what CEO said is that he only protected his company and didn't take the responsibility. This is because the company conceded the imposture in public. Even the upper levels of the company are about to escape from the responsibility. They didn't notice the importance of the case and intend to dispose of the case by only dismissal of two DJs. I strongly believe that such a company doesn't have a right to use radio broadcasting."
908,"There's a sentence said 'He would be Japan's seventh prime minister in six-and-a-half years.', I think this shows one of the causes of Japan's recent political turmoil. No one can achieve anything in a short time. We have to trust the Cabinet we chose and made through the vote, and let them work more."
909,This article says now many Japanese skills decrease rapidly. I have same idea. I think we Japanese should use kanji more and more. Certainly the number of kanji are increasing and English is regarded as important. So some one says Japanese is not very important. But kanji is the part of Japanese culture.We must not forget studying Japanese.
910,"It is probably that we know the the sales of CD is declining and possessing illegally downloaded music or film are bad. But we are charmed with FREE.It is very difficult problems. If police is going to arrest people who illegally downloaded, the plenty of people will be imprisoned.I think police should make the stipulations of illegally downloaded clearly."
911,"I can't believe the action of the man.I can't see why did he do such a stupid thing.I am not interested in art, but I know art is of great value. The paintings displayed in art museum are more than one hundred million yen. This action could be a bit hard to pot right. I hope the incident like this never happens."
912,"I can't agree with Europe receiving Novel Peace Prize. Certainly,60 years without wars is very important thing. But there are many countries without wars more than 60 years.And regarding economic, Europe has crimes as much as wars.Europe leads world to bad situation. Europe must have responsible about that."
913,"I can't believe the decision oh the court. scientists didn't commit a crime.Now,the technique of science is developping.But scientists are not god. So it is impossible that at any time,to predict when and where the earthquake happens,how much damages the earthquake causes.Because earthquakes are natural disaster and acts of God.So I think scientists were not responsible."
914,"I think Obama's re-election is very meaningful not only for America but also for world.In my opinion,Obama seems to be the man having a strong sense of responsibility. And it is also meaningful that a black person was re-elected the president of America which leads world as a leader.In the world, there are still remain racial discriminations.So this election was very important."
915,"I think it is the very difficult problem that Sony and Panasonic can overcome this situation and recover because of the entry of foreign enterprises into the domestic market like Samsung and Apple.Regarding to cellphone and personal computer,it is clearly that Samsung and Apple recently distinguish themselves. But I have heard that Japanese technology is very great more than any other countries. So I believe Sony and Panasonic to recover and lead the world."
916,This news make me feel shocked and angry. Nurses is very busy looking after patients every day.This work which treat people's lives is sacredness. However this incident which the nurse was duped by two DJ and died is inadmissible. I believe incidents like this never happen.
917,"Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27PM JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced... China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I am worried about the relationship between Japan and China.China has many people and these days developps.And now,Japan depends on America and China by every side. So Japan should make good relationship with China.I think Abe is being put to the test,with everyone waiting to see how the relationship is changing. Abe won the election the second time. I'm also interested in which results Abe leads japan to good or to bad."
918,"Honestly, I was surprised when I heard LDP won the election and couldn't believe that result.Thinking about the result of the last election,which LDP completely lost,and the LDP's activities after the election,I had no ideas to think that LDP recover the trust of Japanese citizen. But I've got it, when I saw the voting percentage.It is truth that LDP won the election but the number of votes that LDP obtained didn't change.After consideration about the decrease of the voting percent,the supporters of the LDP didn't increase. I am interested in the manner of the LDP after this election.Seeing the election returns,the winner can't think confidently that much of the citizens believe in them.To recover the trust, they should lend the ears to other parties , for example, the party of Ishinn."
919,"This article is about predict of earthquake so our Japanese inevitably remember the 3.11 earthquake.Recently,some scientists presented the predict of the quake in Nankai Trough.If the real earthquake is more severe than the prediction of scientists ,can we condemn them? The scientists have duties to investigate the tragedy and alarm the people.This responsible is hard and should be carefully taken by them. But they are obliged to make the predict excessive if they are criticized by the failure of underestimating.If so, they can't publish what they think. Academic progress can be done by many failures.In seismology,this theory is applied,too."
920,"It is right that Illegal downloading is one of guilts.I agree with the opinion that this act is like thief.There are people who live by the returns of the music they make. By the way, I'm interested in the sale of CD or DVD.I wonder that the sales of them will increase after this law is enforced.Thinking about diversification of media,not all people get the music by CD.For example, they get them by online.This way of purchase can be done at home or other place. If company want customers to buy CD,they should think new value of CD,which let customers buy."
921,"In addition to praise the recipient's activity,the aim of Novel Prize is to promote the act of recipient .I think this Novel Peace Prize is thought a little differently from other Novel Prize.This Prize for EU means that many people wants EU to unite more strongly. EU was founded after reflection of two World War and Cold War.Although more tighter connection was expected,it is hard to say this dream has come true.EU has lots of problems to solute,for example,European economic crisis.Each country has different opinions and some participating nation doubt about EU itself. In this situation,this award is thought to be a message from the world that cheer EU up."
922,"I think kanji is one of several wonderful culture of japan. We must continue to protect this precious culture. I can read 'utsu',but I can't write it. It is important to use kanji from daily."
923,"I think this reaction is good for the United States. I am always touched by his strongest speech. Honestly, I don't know about American politics very much.,but only I'm interested in problem of American military base at Okinawa. Before, Japanese woman is raped by American solider. I want this kind of happening never to occur. I hope trust relation of American and Japan is more good than before."
924,"Mr.Obama's reelection is good for USA and also for Japan. Especially in economical fields. The yen will keep itself strong and and because of that Japan can buy foreign stuffs cheaper. For instance, it makes possible for us to buy expensive things, such as gasoline cheaper."
925,"At first,I wondered whether Obama could win the election.this is because he was criticized by some American.They said 'He couldn't accomplish the policy that he made in the last election'.In this time of recession,it is hard for people to wait the long-term policy to come true.But now he won the election,it is turned out to be true that American expect his long-term projects. I'm interested in problem of the gun control.Can he reinforce the law?There are lots of opponents,for example, National Rifle Association."
926,"As technology develops, it decreases the opportunities for us to hand-write and I think that this has led Japanese people to start to forget how to write their own language. Some might say that this could lead to losing cultural identity but I still do not think that this is a serious problem. It will become a serious problem when we forget to talk and read Japanese."
927,"I do not see any advantages in making a law for illegal downloads. The move is said to stop falling music sales but in my opinion, people who buy CDs and DVDs in the first place will buy it even if there is a law for illegal downloads or not. It will not make the people who do not buy CDs to go out to the CD store."
928,I find it quite sad that some people cannot understand the value of artistic properties. Another thing shocked me was that victim planed to do such thing by having a painting brush ready to carry it out.
929,Everyone probably thought the same thing but I also think that the EU are worthy of the novel prize as theirs nothing special to it. They should not be any war in the first place.
930,"Being able to predict an earthquake should only be a reference so I find it harsh that the seismologist were blamed for not predicting an earthquake correctly. As it says in the article, this will lead to restricting scientists from expressing freely."
931,Having Obama as president is positive for both Japan and America. I thought this as everyone trusts him and is willing him to continue with his work towards world peace.
932,I am disappointed to hear that Sony has been downgraded by the rating agencies. I have been a huge fan of Sony's product since I was young so I hope they get their place back.
933,"I feel so sorry for the nurse who commit suicide as she must have been put under so much pressure. Even if the nurse did not commit suicide, I still think this is a stupid thing to do and it should not happen again."
934,I do not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. He was put down for a reason last time he was president. If Abe can change Japan he would have made it an even better place while he was president in the past.
935,"I am sad to read this news.Sony had been leader of this secter.These day,Samsung overcome Sony as the article says. Sony cannot join in the companies which make platforms...Sony has lost his way."
936,"I think having Obama as a president of America is good for America and Japan. And I think the way he talks has a lot of power to make people understand and convincing. Every time there is a election in U.S. I always think it is interesting how American citizens become very active because it is very different from Japan. I was surprised when I when to America right before election, there were lots of things that has Romney and Obama's print on them on sale every where. I think this difference of interests comes from the election system in America."
937,"This electing was a first time for me to vote and it was really confusing for me to vote because there weren't a person who I strongly felt that I want to vote. I hope that Abe can do something that will make Japan a better place but I'm not really positive about that because his work as a president before was not really good. I hope that Japanese government settle down once to think what should be really done to Japan, not changing prime minister so many times."
943,"I think these two radio hosts are so sinful that they should be judged by the law. First, the phone call they had made forced the nurse to die. I think their behaviors are equal to murder. And more, Mel Greig told the nurse that she was Queen Erizabeth.It is perjury. Maybe they thought it is only a prank call, but their frivolous behaviors cause a serious matter. We have to think a dividing line between prank and crime seriously."
944,"I do not agree with ID1259's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again.Of course it is a serious problem that Mr.Abe resigned from president because he had a disease.However,according to William Saroyan,a man of ability can learn a lot from failures.This statement apply to Mr.Yoshida.After he resigned from president,he had been president again.Eventually,he took Japanese independence back.He learned a lot from failures.This example will apply to Mr.Abe.I believe that he will do good job.I hope Japanese people believe that too."
945,I think so for your thought.SONY should fight the world in technology.I believe in Japanese technology is best in the world and Japanese company would make an effort to will be best company.Go for it SONY and Japanese company!
946,"First,I think this problem is easy to understand and two DJs committed a crime.But,is that true?We should think the mass media's crime,too.The mass media gives us many amusements and knowledge,so we think it is useful and safe. However ,it is able to kill people easily by disinformation like this case. It is easy to finish this case by blaming two DJs.Though,we must think the mass media again from this case."
951,"I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout,not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required."
955,"In my opinion,biggest difference between Sony and the five companies in the article is the 'contents' It is absolutely true that Sony's products are high quality and durable. And,needless to say,quality and durability of products is very important. However,contents of devices is also pretty important to customers. For example,Apple makes IT products:iPod,iPhone,iPad. And also Apple makes applications(app) for that and sells apps other companies develop. This is what customers are attracted to. For this reason,Sony should make more efforts to develop contents to catch up leading companies in the IT field."
960,"Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11.They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call 'Abenomics'. I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and south Korea. We must compare territorial problem with east Asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation,and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own."
961,"This news makes me very sad. First of all, the hoax call that the DJs did should not be overlooked. I think the media do not care about the method they use for obtaining information, and their actions might cause Jacintha Saldanha's death. In addition, her family and friends must be very sad. Even if their action have nothing to do with her death, those who around her condemn their actions. This news make me recognize that I should not do tease others lightly. I hope they make the same mistake."
965,"Reading this article made me really ashamed because I didn't tried to learn how people damaged by the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan after hearing the news. Also I didn't even pay attention to the car bomb in Iraq. Of course the terrorist attack in Boston was a serious incident and it was natural that media all over the world focused on it. However, the value of people's lives must be equal regardless of economic influence of their countries. We should remember that the press do not necessarily report all the news equally, and should attempt to learn what happen in the world by ourselves."
966,"I was shocked by this news.I think ,actually, there're gap in news.Relatively,Europe and US news are picked up largely.That's because,I think,US and European country such as France,Britain have authority all over the world."
968,"I have received unquestioningly the news given.Therefore,this article get me thinking.If the value of life was estimated unequal,that may be problem. But,I also think that it is natural the mass media take priority to report their own country and related country."
970,I got a feeling of wrongness. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorism must be perished from the world.But there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily.So the mass medias should spread the world's journalism to make our knowledge wider.
971,"I didn't know the bomb accident in Iraq so far. I'm sure it is caused by the media. We always receive a lot of informations all over the world through the media. It is natural that the media tends to pick up the article which has great impact. But we should try to know more aggressive. To accomplish it, quit depending on the media."
974,"Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-Defence Forces to be National-Defence Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time."
975,"I don't think that world's media which failed to report a case of Iran and Pakistan consider American lives to be more important than that of the people who live in developing countries. The reason is that the people who report news as business have to announce the matter which citizens are interested in. The cause is attitude of recipients of news. With this article, I realize own narrow field of vision, so I want to have a wide one. And then,I hope to end the vicious cycle : our indifference bring upon a gap in news coverage and we don't have much interests in developing countries because journalists don't inform about them."
976,"In fact,I've never seen the news of Iraq,Iran and Pakistan,so this article convinced me so much.This'discrimination'by media I very often think about. Its sure that since the terrorist incidents in the developed countries like USA,UK,Japan and so far are very rare and these in developing countries are very common,the shock of the former is much stronger. But the life is equal. The death of all people on this planet must be treated equally. 'another less comfortable explanation is that for much of the world's media, American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world.',this part of the article made me burn with anger.We must confront TV and newspaper with the feeling that the one death by homicide in Japan and one death by terrorism in Iraq are altogether the same loss."
979,"When I heard this news, I was so sad! But I think it's wrong to connect this murder case with the argument that the death penalty should be abolished. I think there are problems about the system of the prison of Japan. It is only several weeks later that he took their lives after he is discharged from prison.I think the prison of Japan don't have the system which let the criminals reflect on their past behavior deeply."
980,"When I heard news of Boston, I was very surprised. I could not believe that heavy damage was given by bomb terrorism in America. However, I never surprised when I read this article and knew bomb terrorism in Iraq. Just thought 'a similar trouble happened in Iraq again'. I was very shocked such my way of thinking. Because maybe many people think in the same way, I think it is not to be helped that world media focuses attention on Boston. I hope to decrease trouble in Middle East, and want to be a person who understand that the value of the life is equal."
983,"I also felt quite strange because the media didn't report much about other sad events of the world.But since the people who work for the press have to earn living,I think it is so reasonable that they choose the news which attracts the interests of people more and cannot perfectly report based on moral perspectives.And whatever we said to them,they would never change their way of reporting. I think it important for us,who enjoy the media,to be conscious of inequality of the media,to pay attention voluntarily to the news which are not picked up especially,and to find them not less important."
986,I think that mass media treated American people and developing countries people unequally. I am actually likely to forget the blasting terror attack of Iraq and the earthquake of Iran and Pakistan in response to the influence of mass media. Also the earthquake of Sichuan was reported smaller than Boston news. I would like to have the media literacy and my opinion about the news.
987,I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr.Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.
988,I was shocked by this article. Why the mass media reported the Iraqi terrorism smaller than the American? Maybe people think that the Iraqi terrorism on 15/4 is less surprising than the American.So mass media reported American bigger depending on the interest of the viewer. The biased view is not mass media's but is ours. I should be more interested in the accident of the world without biased view.
989,"It is very interesting that we can see people's sense of values from headlines.I was surprised how uniform the choices by the media around the world are. Frankly speaking,I felt the explosions in Boston is more remarkable incident for me than car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake in Iran and Pakistan.But it is true that the latter incidents are also matters which we should know because they are very sad events. We must keep in mind that news don't tell us all the incidents around the world and have will to find as many remarkable matters as possible by ourselves."
991,"I think this news is really sad. I think what those two journalists do are not so good. In my opinion , journalists should know their position well and behave correctly."
992,"I was shocked by hearing the news. Because there are no tragedies like terrorism in Japan. But I think this is broadcast exaggeratedly. If this kind of matter happened in Africa , few reports were broadcast. From this news , I think the importance of life varies with the region."
993,"The mass media have a powerful influence on private citizens,so unless they stop the gaps in news we can never achieve a harmonious and multicultural society. Also We should try to know voluntarily what is happening now all over the world.Only accepting something provided is dangerous for us and the future society ."
994,"When I read this news, I was really shocked. This is because I can expect Mrs Saldanha is an excellent nurse and well-respected and popular with all of her colleagues as chief of the hospital said. Also I feel anger for the DJ. Things what they did were unforgivable."
995,"When I heard this terrible news,It reminded of me the terrorism of 9.11 in USA. The explosion took the lives of general public so I hope the terrible trouble such this is never happened. And I want the news organizations to report the world news not only the famed cities but also small cities."
997,"Although I think this accident is so important that media should cover this closely,this column implies that the media do not play the original part. The media should inform people of a news which happens all over the world equally. I think the management of the press is the main cause of this case,so we should reconsider about the interests of people who work for media."
999,"When I heard the news, I couldn't believe my eyes. The scene was awful. Actually, the explosions caused a great deal of damage. Three people were killed and around 183 people were injured. It was the sad news. I was also surprised when I knew who the terrorists were. They were about as old as I was. I don't know what made them to do the act of terrorism, but only I can say is that innocent people died, even a boy of eight. I wonder if there is any other way to change the world. In addition, I got another impression when I read this news item. To tell the truth, I didn't know much about car bombs in Iraq and the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. One of the reason is that some media organisations failed to mention them at all. To know about the world equally, I think we need to get information carefully."
1000,"I agree the last explanation, which is that much of the world's media lay more emphasis on American lives than on the lives of people living in the developing world. Humans are a dime a dozen. Even if someone thinks me as his only girl, my life is worthless at the same time for an utter stranger to me. In that theory, the more I influence the worthier my life becomes. America is the most influential and the richest country in the world. So, it's natural that American news has priority over all other country's news."
1001,"Abe lost election six years ago.I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do.But this time,he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted."
1002,"I was really surprised at this explosions.Because I live in Hiyoshi alone,I do not have TVs.I though that this world continued to be peace until I heard it at that class. I am more interested in one thing.It is that ''World media focuses attention on Boston after marathon explosions''.Of course Many people thought that the explosions in Boston were the first successful terrorist attack in the USA since 9-11, which made it a significant event.However,I think ''American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world''. I have good reasons to think so.For example,USA have the most powerful economic power and fighting power in the world.If one country was less interested in this thing,it would be hated by USA.USA is also controlling world medias. USA is the biggest state in the world!"
1003,"I heard this news, I thought who caused this incident.South Korean,American,or Islamic extremist.This incident's perpetrators were American.One of the criminal said that I have no friends of American. Recently,I've been heard coverage of they were Islamic extremists. I don't know why they caused incident. Reason is not simple. But if they had also one American friend,this incident may not have happened."
1004,"I've heard about the news in Boston because it was broadcast by Japanese media constantly. But I had not heard about the news in Iraq, Iran nor Pakistan. I think mass-media should report news equally to people all around the world."
1005,"When I heard this news, I thought we can't predict when we face incident and who cause terror.In this case, criminals are ordinary young boys, bombs are made by pressure cookers, there are everywhere in the U.S. How should we notice they are terrorist? How should we notice those are bombs? Probably citizens of Boston will become nervous, but I think they have to be friendly. Because, socially-isolated people will be terrorist."
1006,"When I read the article, I could not understand that media considered that American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world.And I think that the media should deal with the news of not only the United States but every country in the world. The media should especially determine the weight of a life by neither a race nor nationality."
1008,"I was so disappointed to read this article, because of the difference in media's treating between American lives and the lives in developing country. I think that the most important thing is not the place happened event, but contents of event. Therefore, the media should pay attention to what kind of event."
1009,"When I read this article, I felt so sad. This news reminded me of 9.11. I cannot understand why people kill someone. Terrorism kill innocent people. This terrorism is the first time in 12 years. I thought no more terrorism would happen in America but it happened. We should think about terrorism again because it can happen anytime in America,also in Japan."
1010,"I think it is natural that world media focuses attention more on marathon explosions in Boston, the USA, than on catastrophes happened in other countries. Since around WW1, the US have been the most powerful country economically and militarily in the world, so it is no surprise that American news is regarded as very important. In my opinion, it is not the problem of different degree on worthiness in lives between nationalities. Americans and non-Americans, especially people in the developing countries should be the same in that respect. The Charter of the United Nations insists that we all have fundamental human rights naturally. However, when it comes to the big news like explosions by terrorists, the one in the US may be the most noticeable. It is because it is unusual that big strong country is attacked by someone. People would find it interesting or devastating seeing that kind of incident. Particularly in Japan, the relationship with the US is so strong that the media may run constant updates of Boston and not much of any other news. It is sad for me not to be able to see other countries' catastrophes and I'm sorry for them, but it is the reality."
1011,I was shocked to hear this news. This terrorism is so terrible. I am terrified. But there are not only this terrorism but also other terrorism in the world. I think the problem is not the place where the terrorism happened. The most important thing is every terrorism are known by many people in the world. I want many media organizations report news in the world equally. I think every lives are worth equally.
1013,"When I heard this news,I thought two things. First of all,it was very regrettable that the sports event should be fun was a target of aiming indiscriminately citizens and tourists. However,I think we should review what coverage should be in future.Because focused on just this incident on the other hand, car bombs in Iraq and many casualties by an earthquake in Iran and Pakistan did not become major news. Certainly,this incident may be the case should be preferred,but tragedies happen allover the world. Second, not only we feel sad,but we should use lessons learned in order not to happen like this incident in Japan. In Japan, the sports event Tokyo Marathon' like 'Boston Marathon' is held every year. So I want so as not to inflict deep wound in the hearts of many people, we also Japanese review the security measures and share the information to be able to react to an emergency. At the time,I think not only authorities and guards,but we citizens should have the consciousness to cooperate is essential."
1014,"I was shocked by this news.But a lot of such cases happen in the world. I felt that Japan was very peaceful.However, it does not the reason why it does not need to know the world miserable news. We have to know the world event more. I think that the Japanese media should report more world news."
1015,I was very surprised at the news about two explanations in America. I am wondering why the culprit wounded an uninvolved third party. I want the culprit caught immediately. I also think there is a rift between developed countries and developing country. We should treat everybody in the world equally.
1016,I was surprised and ashamed of myself when I read the news and I found that many other sad events had happened in the world. I was also the one who paid much attention to the news of Boston bombing. I often hear there are no more safer countries than Japan around the world.But I think many developed countries are safe contrary to many developing countries.I suspect that many people also regard developed country as safe area. That is why I guess the accident in Boston shocked many people around the world. I think the preconception brought about the gap in news coverage.
1017,"The gap in news coverage is what I have been concerned about since around 10 Japanese people were killed in Algeria about 6 months ago, if I remember right. Japanese media paid great attention for that sad events and the media made too private reports too, such as how the casualties were adored be the people around them, how the trauma of the incident survived people have was going to be cured and videos of the friends of the casualties crying. On the other hand, the media made no reports of the reason why the peace is disturbed in Africa including Algeria nor the civil war taken place just 20 years ago that made more than 150,000 casualties. One reason why there is such a gap is that those events happen almost everyday in the Middle East and Africa so the media simply cannot follow them, but I think pretty much every person in 'developed countries' do not consider lives in 'developing countries' the same as theirs. I am not sure if I can say it is wrong, but I personally dislike the trend."
1018,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was surprised very much. And I thought that it was terrible if a similar case happened in Japan. We think unconsciously that such a case which happens at the place such as Iraq should not happens at the place where we live. I think this is the reason of the gap in news coverage."
1020,I got to know terrorism's occurrence and was very much surprised. I was not able to understand an offender. Why did the offender wake up terrorism? We must not waste people's lives. I was very sad for my having read this report to the last. That is because the media in the world have not made people's worth equal. It became impossible for a while for me to trust media.
1021,"I didn't know the sad incidents that happened all over the world except two explosions in Boston Marathon.To attract people's attention, the news media report the major news a little bit exaggeratedly. We should do not only to receive the information, but also to select and think of the information."
1022,"This news made me so sad when I see the news on TV.A spectacle which two bombs exploded together surprised me very much because it was so cruel. this article say that world media focused on this news excessively.I think too. There is reasons of this insistence. First,this tragedy happened in U.S.A. U.S.A is most major country.When terrorism is successful,it's influence is biggest in the world.So this news interest more people than other news which happened in The Middle East. I think media's reaction is natural.But I want medias to report various news. I want medias not to let people say 'American lives are worth more than the lives of people living in the developing world.'"
1023,"I was shocked at two things about the news. One is,of course,that many people were injured and several people were killed. The other thing that shocked me was the reaction against the news.Many newspapers failed to mention about the misfortune in the middle east and many people didn't know the news.I'm also one of them.I felt really ashamed and thought that we must always consider a problem from different angles. American people's reaction also shocked me.After the terrorist was arrested people gathered and keep on shouted 'USA' for a long time.They 'looked' really happy and cheerful.We often this scene in USA.But,you know,this event is a tragedy.Terrorism has occurred and many people were injured,also killed.We shouldn't behave cheerful.Also we should think the background of this terrorism,not just behaving thoughtlessly on a given occasion.Why did young ordinary man did such a thing?Because he was from Chechen?Because he was a Muslim(I don't think so)?There is always a reason behind such event.As long as people all over the world won't think carefully,and behave like part of American people we can't fight against terrorism in true sense."
1024,"I think this case is very difficult problem.Because,it contains two different problems. First problem is terrorism. As we know, terrorism is atrocity action.But,culprits may have something on their mind.After due consideration, we should take measures. Second problem is weight of life. I think weight of life is different depending on the person. For example, I think a useful man for everyone is heavy and culprit is light. But,it is not by nation,sex. This is just my idea. But,we should think many things from this case."
1025,"I became so sorry to hear this sad news. Many people are killed in the world every day, especially in developing countries. However, most of us ignore them. The explosion was occurred in America, the most powerful country all over the world, so the media broadcast this incident, I think. We have learn many things from this explosion."
1026,"I felt very sad to hear the terrifying news. Boston Marathon is one of the biggest sports events in the world, and so many people join it from all over the world. It is important and happy for us to connect with foreign people throughout sports if normally held. Therefore, I never forgive the culprits even if they have any reasons to commit a crime. However, there is a more serious problem behind this explosions. We all know the Boston bombing but do not know other terrible affairs happened at the same period of time. This is because world media organizations failed to mention them at all. After all, we general public are not given the chance to know them. Although some say there is priority in news coverage, I cannot agree with that because each affair always becomes the most significant to the relatives of victims. So, in my opinion, they should not completely ignore small scale matters around the world."
1027,"I was very sad to hear the news that many people was killed by this terrorism indiscriminately. To begin with, I became aware of this incident by watching TV, but I didn't know what other sad events happened in the developing countries. The U.S.A was so powerful developed country that the most mass media would report this incident. So I think the mass media is biased. However, I think that the mass media response is natural. The mass media usually have to select informations according to priority. So such a gap in news coverage always happen, in my opinion. Therefore, we must not only receive the information passively, but also get other information actively."
1028,"I think it's not about our respect for each life but about our interest. America is very influential over other countries because of business, politics and so on, and their culture such as their music and movies are popular to people all over the world. Above all, such a terrible terror hadn't happened in America since 9-11. On the other hand, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan are less influential for us. Furthermore, Iraq isn't a safe country originally, and earthquake is natural phenomenon. Therefore, the affair in America collects our interest more, and has more impact into us, so it's natural for media to put emphasis on that news. However, the news in those developing countries had to be known to people in the world. Then I think that media would show those news if we really cared about them. media is mirrors of what we think, so we have to consider about ourselves this time."
1030,"I did not know that the same day as this bombing had the automobile bombing in Iraq, either. However, more the incident of Iraq persons than a U.S. incident have passed away. We think that we need to consider this fact more earnestly. Even if the country is rich, the weight of a life should not become heavy, and the weight of a life should not become light even if poor. I hope people in the world recognize this problem in this incident."
1033,"I was surprised at the explosions because after 9.11 America has clearly improved the ability of guarding. And in my opinion,the width of the gap in news coverage depends on the number of affected people. Speaking of this case,the incident of America,the center of economy and the leader of developed countries,affects more people than one of a developing country does. But this isn't justice. We should cover various news around the world in point of ethical view."
1034,"When I first heard about this news, I was shocked at this miserable incident. Especially, it was sad thing that the child aged only eight was killed in the explosion.This event may have reminded American people of the fear that they felt on 3.11. Almost all of the media organisations around the world reported this news soon after the explosion.But, they did not report some news that happened on the very same day; for example, car bombs at market places in Iraq, which killed over 30 people. In my opinion, the reason why there is such a gap in news coverage is the powers of countries.In this case, U.S. has a great influence on the world because U.S. has a great economic and military power.In contrast, Iraq does not have much influence. However,I think media organisations in the world should report world events that have dead persons as much as possible.This is because we should value all human's life regardless of his or her nationality."
1035,"This news made my interest in world media. This is because I knew the news about marathon explosions in Boston, but I didn't know about earthquake in Iran and Pakistan and car bomb in Iraq. From this article I learned we only know the news which media was take up, so our knowledge about world news is only a little part. I feel ashamed about this, and I thought we need to be more greedy about world news."
1036,"I think it is safe all over the world, because I can't feel the danger in Japan. But this news made me remember, and so scary. People always fight terrorism, war, and so on. I am blessed, so I should feel the world more to go abroad. Terrorism at Boston Marathon made the citizen scary, because 9.11 happened at the building of the high position, but this time happened at the very near position. People felt the danger of the terrorism, so hard. I think terrorism should fade out, so people should think more about the terrorism!!!"
1037,"There was no way these media was to blame. In fact the U.S. is the world's economically biggest country. If such bombing accident should occur around the Wall Street, it will absolutely affect world's stock price, and a financial panic may occur. Also, since 9/11 happened, the U.S. has been trying to acts of terrorism. Thanks to this, some attempts are revealed in advance. However, this bombing accident in Boston did occur. Seen from this aspect, I think these media treated this accident properly."
1038,"USA is very influential all over the world and the connection among the countries is storong.Furthermore terrorism has big impact to us. So,I think it was natural that media took it seriously. In addition, not only the case of sad news but in the case of ordinary news, there are the gap in the news coverage. Therefore, I declare the phenomenon was not caused by the gap of worthiness of our lives but the difference of our concern. And, I heard the incredible story that the explosion may have been fabrication, in spite of it was attracted so much attention around the world . When I knew that , I don't know whether it is true or not, I think we should not depend on limited information sources,and accept it without question."
1039,"In my opinion, mainly, news broadcast on media is an emergency.For example, the explosion in Boston marathon is exactly an unusual incident. But it doesn't mean that other incidents aren't important. Ideally, all things happened in the world should be broadcast on media. In fact, many factors- time, information and attention by people- interrupt broadcasting. In this condition, we need actively pay attention to affairs which aren't broadcast on media.This may make us familiar with much international information."
1040,"After I red this article, I was angry at the idea of racial discrimination. However if I think about it, I have such a idea in some small measure . Of course I don't think that American (Japanese) lives are worth more than the lives of the people in the developing world, but I think Japanese and American and the like people are excel-er at bottom. So, I think the problem of racial discrimination are not easy problem. But, I wish the world really without racial discrimination, and we must make an effort to exclude racial discrimination."
1041,I think this is very important problem. America is one of the largest country. And many people are interested in matter of America. So media report news of America more than news of the developing world. But I think that not all the people think the news of America is more important than the news of the developing world. So media should report not only large country's news but also the developing country's news. I think that media must understand that the lives of people living in the developing world as important as American lives .
1043,"I think this media response shows the U.S.A. is the most powerful country in the world. If two explosions hadn't happened, other news would take attention. It is because those news are big news,too. However, because of the impact which the U.S. has, they were not in the spotlight. That's the way it goes. However, that doesn't mean that you should ignore those news. I think you must notice those news even if they are not in the spotlight."
1044,"I think it is complex to arise the gap. and the world media overlooked the possibility of developing country. There are the gap between developing countries and developed nations about news,too. As we know,the U.S is one of the most effective countries in the world. and this is the nation which incurred tragic terrorism. so I think there are compound reasons to occur the gap of broad cast. Moreover, the developing countries have the possibility to lead the world. That is why I think the media have to attention these countries,too."
1045,"I think the importance of life should not be different depending on region. But in fact, media intend to broadcast mainly about developed countries, for instance the U.S, the U.K, Germany, France and so on. On the other hand, developing countries in Africa, Middle-east, Asia are rarely broadcast. If accident like 9.11 happens in Africa, this accident may not spread worldwide. I think this wrong, but in reality, this may be true."
1046,"Actually,I saw news of accidents in America than Iraq and Pakistan on TV.Of course,we must understand that American lives are worth as well as the lives of people living in the developing world.There is no difference between them. On the other hand,I think many people are interested in American news more than the developing country because of the power of nation. Japan has strong relationship with U.N.,so American news have possibility of having an effect on Japan.This reason applies other countries.As a result,World media focuses attention on U.N. after developing countries."
1047,"I was surprised at reading this article.Because, gun was made by printer. This means that anyone will be able to make gun in near future.I think to own weapon for self defense is wrong. We have to reduce weapon in the world. So, we need rules of plastic gun. I hope that 3D printer useful for development of the world."
1048,"I think it is very dangerous to distribute the blueprints for the gun online. Getting the blueprints online means that lay public can make guns for themselves. Of course, gun is a dangerous substance, and there is a possibility to cause a horrible accident. I consider that 3D plastic printer is convenient, however, I think we have to think about how to use it over and over."
1049,"I thought this is a awful news. The reason is that a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone, so making guns will be very easy thing. If this happens, people in countries which ban gun use can get guns illegally. Illegal possession of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns before they are completely available online. I think regulations through the Internet is effective measure for example."
1050,"This news gave me a great impact.That is because guns can be produced by 3D printer.I think this new development will give us bad luck in the future.This reason to think so is that gun will be more easy to make and more popular than ever before.More people have guns than ever before. Murders happen because there are guns in our life.If you want to reduce the number of murders,you have to reduce the number of guns.However,the new development will increase the number of guns. In short,the news will produce bad luck,no good luck."
1051,"When i read this article, I was surprised. To tell the truth, I didn't even know much about the 3D printer. Of course, 3D printer is an epoch-making invention because it makes it possible to copy all kinds of things. However, according to the article, I also think that it causes serious trouble if you used it in the wrong way. If anyone can make his own gun easily, it will bring chaos. There is no need to get a gun easily. I hope the US government will make a new strict regulation about this situation early."
1052,"I was surprised that guns can be produced by 3D printer.I think that new invention may inflict damage on us in the future. If guns can manufacture easily, people can get them easily rather than before. However, if the government does not enact law, people may abuse them."
1053,So I think that the government should tighten up regulation.
1054,"I think the plastic guns are very dangerous. That cannot be detected by walk-through metal detectors, and that can kill people. People with the plastic gun can take a plane without being by the metal detector. I watched a news that a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. After all, we shouldn't have not only plastic guns, but also usual guns."
1055,"When I first know about the 3D printer, I was really amazed at its function .The invention of 3D printer is a great achievement, but I have a concern about the outcome of it. The 3D printer can produce guns. It means in the future everyone will be able to produce guns easily.This situation is really dangeress.So there should be some kind of regulations when we use the 3D printers."
1056,"I cannot see the handgun directly. Because I see the handgun via comic books and televisions, my image of it is the weapon just to kill people. After I read this article, I hit upon a question, 'Is there a need to improve the handgun?' If the handgun develops, such the plastic handgun which is undetectable like this article or further miniaturization, the number of people killed will increase. I think that it's wasteful and miserable to use human intelligence not on something to save people like medical science but on something to make people grieve like an atomic bomb. Developments of new products need much time and money. We had better invest our exertions into public happiness or utensils which make the society more convenient instead of something which is doubtful whether legal or illegal."
1057,"I have not known about 3D printer until I read this article and was very surprised at the function of 3D printer such as making the plastic handgun. I think that invention of 3D printer in itself is so amazing, but spread of 3D printer is dangerous, because everyone can get weapon such as plastic handgun. Therefore, I suggest that government of each nation should regulate using 3D printer to keep safety in future."
1058,"First of all,I was surprised at this news by knowing that I thought that it would be in the future and have already realized. But I felt awful simultaneously. The blueprints of the gun can download online that written in this article, it seems that peoples who downloaded it are more than 60,000 peoples in Japan. That is,it can be said that is theoretically possible for peoples in japan able to print the gun from data. And if 3D-printed gun were to spread widely,anyone would be able to make gun,and no customer buying history and no criminal record of the gun couldn't help spreading. In this way, there are many risk when 3D printers spread to home,but also said that may cause a revolution in relation to design and manufacturing. If we can get design like the gun, we may be able to print things at home without bothering to go shopping. When it becomes so,our lives probably will become convenient more than expected."
1059,"When I read this article, I was simply impressed by the advance in technology. Not long ago, we could not print something in various colors but only in black and white. Now we can compose guns by 3D printers! How cool is that? Of course it is not appropriate for ordinary people to make guns. However, I think plastic guns should be allowed by laying down some rules. The reason is that the advance in technology is a result of improvement in human intelligence, and we should approve and admire that. To consider plastic guns as a symbol of the human intelligence, we had better think of the way they can be used peacefully. First, the government should ban putting blueprints of guns online so that ordinary people cannot easily make them. Second, police authorities should arrest people who are having guns with no permission as soon as they found them. For now, I can only think of these rules, but I am sure there are many other rules to be set."
1060,"'Guns are only instrument that injure person', this is my opinion. I think that we should not produce guns because this behavior falls far short of a peaceful world and using these weapons is gangsterism. But it is also a fact that it has been taking a long time and a great effort for producing guns, and it curb a useless war. I accept this fact and think of gun this after time."
1061,"Many people say that the guns made from plastic are really dangerous because they cannot be noticed with metal detecters.These guns would make terrorism and crimes easier to be performed,but probably we can't create the perfect regulations to prevent them from being spread across the world. People developed technology so highly and rapidly that our moral standards don't keep up with it.I'm afraid that someday we'll be killed,or now we might be being killed,by our own technology,which has been out of our hands."
1062,"Why Cody Wilson developed 3D-printed handgun?To self-defense of civilian?Just a curiosity?I think he should not have to developed and to published blueprint on the web all the more, because in the U.S,the accident by gun for children become a issue. By the way, I recall the terrorism in Boston.I thought we can't notice who is a terrorist, if 3D-printed handgun will be made in standard home, it's become more difficult to find dangerous person.So I propose exploit 3D-printed bulletproof vest."
1063,"This news clearly showed us that a 3D plastic printer had an enough ability to copy such a complicated product accurately. It means that 3D printers would play a very important role in the manufacture of industrial products in the near future, since they could help people who don't have special facilities make products or develop their inventions. On the other hand, I strongly disagree with the idea of publishing the blueprints for the gun online, because it will allow everyone to make guns. This makes it easier for terrorists and radical criminals around the world to get arms instead of smuggling. Cody Wilson should make use of the great skills of 3D printers in a peaceful way."
1064,"I think it is a bad news because people should not use force easily.3D-printed handgun must change our ideas about force.Perhaps,we will regard 3D-printed handgun as a toy even though we can kill a man by it. If we have a strong power,we must take on responsibility for it.But,3D-printed handgun may make us forget the responsibility by getting easily. So,I oppose 3D-printed handgun."
1065,"At first, this news sounded interesting to me because we can make anything easily by using 3D-printer. However, it means anyone can make weapons like this article. It is so dangerous. I think 3D-printer is good thing and I want to use this for fun but I never want to use this for fighting or making weapons. So we should think about this problem and make some rules to use 3D-printer for example, 'Making weapons by using 3D-printer is prohibited.'"
1066,"In my opinion,all guns should be banned by the low.So if this 3D-printed handgun has destructive power as equal as normal gun,this gun is also had to be regulated.But The United States does not even have sufficient 'normal' gun control.I doubt this gun is banned in real."
1067,I was surprised that guns are produced by 3D printer. I think 3D printer is the very useful instrument. A great achievement of technology such as 3D printer can produce guns. It is full of inconsistencies. I think the gun is one of the most dangerous instruments. The guns can kill people. The guns cause dangerous matters. I hope that the guns are banned in the world.
1068,"I feel that I'm very terrible about this news while I admired innovation. Now, 3D plastic printer has not yet become a common sight , however, some other time, it will be spread to the general public. When it became so, on the one hand, we get convenience and originality. On the other hand, we will have the risk. The risk is very serious. It means that a terrorist brings in a gun in secret and is usable to hijack an airplane.The gun which is not discovered in a metal detector makes it easy that someone perform terrorism. For reasons of the above, I think this technique is splendid, but it must be prohibited from making a gun by using a 3D printer."
1069,"When I read this article, I remembered how I was not good at learning vocabularies. I know there are many ways to learn English. I had used the first, second and third example style of vocabulary notes. Personally, the second example style was good for me because writing example sentences made it possible for me to remember vocabularies easily. On the other hand, I didn't know the fourth and final example style of vocabulary notes. Though I'm not sure if those style of vocabulary notes are fit for me, I want to use them next time."
1070,"I also think vocabulary notebooks are one of the most useful tools for learning a language. But in my case, I get a feeling of satisfaction by only writing vocabulary at notes,so I do not review. For example, I only listen to classes absentmindedly during writing vocabulary at notes. If I do not listen to classes because I write notes, it is all over for both of me. So I think that that is not necessarily useful tools to learning a language by using vocabulary notebooks."
1071,"When I watched this news for the first time, I was surprised very much.Why he would show a figure of setting of the gun? He has got rid of value of one invention.The new technique has turned into the weapon. I think that 'the technological change' is synonymous with 'the evolution of the weapon'. The science does the life of people usefully, but makes danger at the same time.It is sad that the invention such as the 3D printer is applied to a weapon."
1072,"I didn't know anything about 3D-printed handgun, and I am surprised to know that there is such a thing. The fact that handguns can easily be made is too dangerous. There are many shooting incidents happening in America and it will only encourage these affairs. It is necessary for people in America to think about the meaning of guns ownership."
1073,"This article is very helpful for me in learning language. I have used only the first example style of vocabulary notes when I make it. In addition, I sometimes missed information of word without Japanese meanings. Therefore, I will adopt second, third, fourth and final example style of vocabulary notes in my way of learning language to improve my vocabulary skills."
1074,"I made flash cards to learn vocabulary or words. This is quick and easy way to remember but is not the most effective method. I never used word maps like the fourth or the fifth example. However, these ways are good ways to study vocabulary that I want to use actively in speaking and writing. So I will use word map to learn vocabulary."
1075,"When I finished reading this article, I was surprised to know that there are a lot of ways to learn new words. Until now I always used only the first or second examples. I think it is important to be able to use English practically,such as speaking fluently or writing clearly. So I decided to use other three ways to learn new words. Now I want to learn as many collocations as possible in order to use easy words practically. I also thought that example sentences are useful to learn new words easily."
1076,"I was so surprised to watch this news that Cody Wilson innovated 3D-handgun. 3D-handgun can be made easily, cheaply,so it means handgun is more familiar to us. It is true that Cody Wilson is the great inventor,but he cannot contribute to the world and his invention may make the world worse. Especially, in the U.S.A, as it's law permit people in the U.S.A to have handgun, the invention of the 3D-handgun will let them get and use handgun more easily, and may cause a lot of shooting incidents, in my opinion. So I agree Charles Schumer's opinion that 3D-handgun should be banned. In Japan, it's law prevent people in Japan from having handgun. However, the invention of weapon, such as 3D-handgun, may invite shooting trouble in Japan. I think that we have to think about the danger of having weapon,in order to avoid the damage of weapon."
1077,"Honestly speaking, I do not really like listing new words in vocabulary notes. I can't be bothered making time for it. When I was in junior high school, I tried to make special English vocabulary notes, but gave up for it soon. It was so time-taking that I had no choice but that. I wasn't satisfied just to list Japanese meanings, and wanted to write almost everything written in a dictionary. Instead of making vocabulary notes, I always try to remember and save vocabularies in my brain. In order to do so, I read many passages aloud again and again. After that, vocabularies and collocations are naturally memorized in my brain. I recommend everyone to have a try at this method because it really works!"
1078,"When I read this article, I found that there were a lot of ways to learn English. Until now, I usually used the first example of vocabulary notes. In addition to, I'd like to use the third example of vocabulary notes. However,I don't like the second, fourth and final example of vocabulary notes, because I can do without Japanese language. Before I speak, use and write English, I involuntarily think the content in my brain by Japanese language. So I can't think things by English. In my opinion, English is tool for telling foreigner what I think."
1079,"I do not like studying English because memorizing English vocabulary is not easy for me.But,I think my way of memorizing vocabulary may be bad after reading this article.Especially, word map is very devastating.If I change the way of studying English,I may be good at English.So,I decide to use many ways to study English because I believe Try and Error is important for everything."
1080,"When I learn English, it is the hardest that I learn a word. I remembered a word by the first method so far. However, I noticed that the way was non-efficiency by having read this sentence.I cannot make English sentences even if I remember the meaning of the word in Japanese. However,if I am going to learn all in English like second instance,my burden becomes big.Therefore I think that the vocabulary notebook which added Japanese to the fourth example and the fifth example is good.I think that 'word map' is the most helpful for myself."
1081,"I think to make vocabulary notebook is important, but I'm satisfied with just build up word book. So I rarely read word book. I study English, especially vocabulary only before the exam. Method is just read vocabulary few times. I couldn't memorize any words and I often got terrible score. Recently, I think it's important use and talk English as much as possible, so I'll try to talk in English with my friends who live in U.K."
1082,"I strongly criticize the 3D-printed handgun.This is because the development has very dangerous effects on all the countries of the world.If the plastic gun is permitted, anyone who has a 3D printer and plan of the gun can get power to kill others.Moreover, the gun is not detectable by metal detectors, and so the police cannot determine who has the gun.As a result, not only in America,but also in all countries of the world, the number of murders will sharply rise.From these reasons, the 3D-printed handgun should be banned in the world."
1083,"I usually used the vocabulary notebooks like the first example, because it is the clearest and easy to make. But I try to write the meanings of the words in English since my English teacher of high school used the dictionary of English which definitions are given all in English. In fact, I realized the enrichment of my vocabulary. Personally, writing the words which I made mistakes by the blue ball point pen is also effective for memorize. I think the ideal vocabulary notebook is different with each person. Exchanging the vocabulary notebooks with friends seems pleasant."
1084,"This articles is very interesting for me. Because, I thought that style of vocabulary note is only one. It is just the first example. It is very useful for examination. But I read this article, I thought this way was wrong. Most interesting method for me is collocations. Immediately, I think that want to try it to next examination."
1085,"When I read this article, I felt very scared of the fact making handguns by 3D printer. I think we have the familiar image of the printer. Nowadays, almost families have the printers and often use them. So I am afraid that we can be easy to create handguns in the near future.though it is not illegal for people to have them in U.S, I think making them by ourselves is more dangerous than that. The government should pay attention not to make them easily and spread them illegally."
1086,"I was surprised at this article, when I first read it. Because it is easy to make the gun. If we can really make it, I can't sleep deeply. Because a person may sight me. I think to make it is very dangerous, so the government should prohibit to make new gun with 3D printer. In the world, people invented the useful things, but is it OK!? People maybe surpass the line which God allow people do. We should think about the moral range!!"
1087,"My vocabulary notebook is similar to the first example introduced in the second paragraph, but I usually add parts of speech and phonetic symbols for the purpose of making sure the pronunciation of the words. This way is easy to check whether I remember all the listed words over and over, but is not helpful to learn how to use them in real situations. In this article, there are many ways which I have never tried such as word maps and collocations. They seem to be very efficient ways to increase your English vocabulary and to enrich your English expressions at the same time. For learners of English and other languages, it is most important to try many ways of vocabulary notes and find out the fittest one for each of them."
1088,"When I read the article, I was surprised at the technology of 3D-printed handgun and at the progress of technology.However,I felt danger at the same time.Permitting everyone to hold the gun means that everybody has the power to kill persons.This will make it easy for the people such as terrorists to get their arm strong.Once the blueprints for the gun is published online, it is difficult to delete it.So I think that we should think about it again and again."
1089,"Well,I don't understand why they've made a new type of gun today.These days there are many controversy about gun regulation in the U.S because of the unstoppable occurrence of gun tragedy.President Obama has mentioned the reinforcement of the regulation.The U.S is at the turning point.Therefore the development of the plastic gun is out of the step with the times.Plastic gun may worsen the situation. Why do you have to make a new type of gun?To save your life?For what you call 'a self-defense'?Why does it has to be plastic?To pass metal detector test?It really sucks.No matter how they might think,I don't think those guns will make us happy."
1090,"I especially agree with the writer's opinion at 'first example'.I've seen many Japanese students do this way of vocabulary learning.But many of them can't use those words in the test and in English conversation because their memories and knowledge monotonous and unstable.English vocabulary can only be acquired from sentences,documents,and actual practice,i think.So I often use the method which is close to 'second example'. But I don't usually use 'fourth example',the collocation method,so I would like to try on that."
1091,"First of all, I was surprised at the news in two ways. One is the existence of an 3D printer and its technology that can even make handguns. The other is to have a handgun is common for people in America although the matter is now controversial. I cannot understand why Americans feel such great interest in guns. Also, I wonder if they don't get satisfaction from an air gun. I think a gun made from plastic is very dangerous because the general public will be able to own it easily. In my opinion, guns only become tools to hurt people or to bring chaos to the society, having a plastic gun should not be allowed. In conclusion, I hope legislation immediately to make a gun with a 3D printer illegal."
1092,"I'm sure that each style has both merits and demerits. The first,Japanese meanings, is the simplest way to learn a language and most of Japanese students should start with this way. This is because they want to get a good score on the very test, that is to say, the way is the most useful to look only for the result on a test. However, the higher the learning advances, the less it can be widely applicable. Therefore, we have to change the way for vocabulary note into the others gradually. Personally I regard synonyms as the most important element for vocabulary notes. Actually I make it a rule to write synonyms in free spaces as much as possible because acquiring synonyms are an essential skill when we express our opinions in details or write an essay. But I haven't got enough collocations yet, so I am going to try other different ways such as word maps or word families."
1093,I was really surprised when I read this article. I did not even know about 3D printer until I read this news. I think it is amazing that we found many kinds of new technologies but we need to be careful how to use them. I think it is really dangerous if anyone can make their own guns easily. It will bring us chaos. I think the US' government should be more careful about guns and should make more strict rules.
1094,"Surely it makes me feel anxious about plastic-made handguns, but it's difficult to restrict these guns, because, in the U.S., people have the right to have guns legally. In fact, Obama is having a hard time to make a gun control law. Rather, what I concern is that the Government makes the 3-D printer illegal thanks to this affair. The printer itself is so hopeful that NASA has bestowed a $125,000 grant on a research corporation to pursue the development of 3D-printable food(according to http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/05/3d-printable-food-NASA-wants-a-taste/). We shouldn't see this problem in a single aspect."
1095,"I used vocabulary book like first example, so this article sounds interesting for me. And I found from this article that the way to learn English is various. For me, the most interesting way to learn English is using collocations. So I want to try to learn English by using collocations."
1096,"I think gun made by 3d printer should be banned because it is copy but it can be used as a gun.3d printer is epoch-making but has a lot of dangerous sides.However , if we use it in a true way, we will feel it is very convenient machine."
1097,"Surely, 3D printer makes the standard of living because anyone can create whatever they want to create. But, creating the matter that can be harmful for other people or unlawful like gun is probable. So creating like this must be banned, and it will be excellent if that can."
1098,"When I was a high school student, I used to make vocabulary notebooks like second and third example. I tried not to use Japanese except translation of technical words and added synonyms, example sentences and collocations. Those notebooks actually helped me to learn English a lot. To learn a foreign language, it is effective to try to think in the language you are learning to improve your language skill."
1099,"I don't see why 3D-printer handgun issue is so controversial. Of course it seems to be dangerous that anybody can make handguns easily by using 3D-printer, but there are so many dangerous things,which can kill people, around us. For example you can make poison gas by mixing dish washing liquid or whatever. I think this 3D-printer issue has given us a vivid impression and that is all. I mean our daily life will not change even if 3D-printed handguns spread."
1100,"He is incredible. Also this news will give old people new power. Japanese society is aging. Because of this young Japanese people will be imposed burdens on.However,like this news,if old people do more for the society, burdens on young people is gonna be lighter."
1101,"It's really surprising for me that the technology of 3D printer has been available in such a way. And in my opinion,from the point of view of safety,the gun should be banned despite it includes the parts of steel."
1102,This should be illegal. Because people can make weapon which can kill people very easily. More important is this gun is made by plastic. Because of this a metal detector becomes useless. So it becomes very hard to find guns.
1103,"Until recently I used vocabulary notebooks like first example, because it was easy to write only English words and Japanese meanings.However, this type depends on only memory.Therefore, when I tried to write an English essay, I could not express my thoughts well.It was not until then that I realized that learning a language should be active.So,now, I use vocabulary notebooks like second example."
1104,"When I read new sentences or articles,I don't know words are the more, I carefully read them again and again. Although I check the words,at this time I have doubts making a vocabulary notebook whether the really effective to improve English skills. Because I think learning new words should learn them in the text. Certainly,I can see new words at a glance by listing up them and deeply understand as to them by writing their meaning and so on. But vocabulary is one of the sentence,so I think learning vocabulary in the sentence is hard to forget. In case of making a vocabulary notebook,I think the second example in the article is effective."
1105,"In the US, it is impossible to ban using guns because guns are too common to ban. But I think if the guns become more available, people will get less attention to human's life. So, I think spreading 3D-printed handgun may make more amount of terrible or criminal cases. Of course, guns are useful to protect owner's body from something dangerous. But they must know they all can be criminal by using it and regulate within bounds."
1106,"I was trying to memorize English words the way like the first examples when I was a student preparing for an entrance examination,for I was too busy to write other things on my vocabulary notebooks. And actually,it's effective to only read English texts. But now we need not only to read them but also to express our opinions clearly,so I want to try the fourth example,a good way to study vocabulary that I want to use actively in speaking and writing."
1107,"The most attractive example for me is the second example after reading this article. Because the second one is a vocabulary notebook for remembering words and to enable using words in real life. I was too busy memorizing vocabularies but now, I want to study learning vocabularies for practical use."
1108,"I had often tried to memorize words with the first example. But I have avoided other cases because whenever I tried such examples, it made me more confused. But after reading this blog, I knew that it has many missing points. I thought that I should try other methods to brush up my skill. By the way, looking the poll questions, I found that many students voted the first example like I had tried. I was relieved."
1109,"I watched 3D printer also on television immediately after reading this report. I think it dangerous that a gun can be made also from whom if I use this printer. However, I think that 3D printer is uncanny and useful. I think that it is necessary to make law so that 3D printer cannot be abused. Then, I think that everybody can use 3D printer in comfort."
1110,"I've been studying method that remember the word that appears in reading the text until now. I also tried first and second example to learn a word pledge, but I feel it was hard to remember the word without any related. But I know third,fourth and final example this time, I think relating the meaning of the word with each other may be effective. I'd like to try these methods."
1111,I already knew that there is the technique of the 3Dprinter. However I was surprised to know that this technique can make a gun. Because I did not think that it could make the thing which a strong shock hung like a gun. This technology is very convenient. But it is clear to become the big problem when people can easily make a gun in this way. I think that legal regulation is ineffective. I hope that the system which people can't produce the dangerous material is made.
1112,"I was surprised to hear this news very much. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. It is awful!! I hope that the casualties case using this gun does not happen."
1113,"I have studied English by the wordbook. However, I had done only the first example. It got to know that I read this report and there were the various studying methods. I think that I will learn using the studying method different from usual from next time."
1114,"When I study vocabulary, I often use the first,second and third example style of vocabulary notes.Reading this article, I found that there were many styles of vocabulary notes for learning a language.Now I would like to use the forth example style using word maps and collocations,for I want to use vocabulary actively in especially speaking and writing.Moreover I think that I would like to find the style that is more suitable for my aim of using the notes."
1115,"If the blueprints of the gun would be published online,we would be able to make guns ourselves by 3D printer.I think this easiness is terrible. The easier we can get guns , the more accident or criminal happen. 3D printer is probably convenient but we should restrict carefully what is allowed to make by the printer and what is not. Otherwise, our safety would be endangered."
1116,"I was surprised at this news,and I was also don't know about car bombs at market places in Iraq, there were many casualties after an earthquake struck Iran and Pakistan. It cannot exist a discrimination. Lives of each people are equal."
1117,"I usually used vocabulary book like first example. I thought this way was most useful to learn English. After I read this article, I change that thought. I think the most effective way to learn English is using example sentence. I think I can use English in real situation by using this way. I decide to learn English by using example sentence."
1118,"When I was a high school student,I used first and second style and didn't notice the other styles.I learned by this article that the style of studying is abundant and I should try to find the best style suit to a goal. Now I want to brush up my English writing skills,so I want to try the fourth style."
1119,Guns are shouldn't made easily. We have to ban the plastic guns;otherwise we will live in a dangerous world in the future.
1120,"After I read this article, I was really surprised about handguns can make by 3D printer. Also I felt scare about the news. This is because near the future, if 3D printer will spread to the public, a lot of people are able to get handguns easily. In Japan, there is a law of control guns strictly, but if 3D printer guns were spread, that law will not able to work anymore. I think this situation will bring more crime. So I think we need some laws about 3D printer which control weapons strictly."
1121,"Vocabulary notes are certainly important for learning languages. I'm using the first example of vocabulary notes. I read this article, I found some hints to improve my notes. I will try new ways."
1122,"I always used the vocabulary notebooks like the first example, because it is easy to learn it very much and is easy to make it. However I forget the meaning of the word immediately even if I can learn it, and can't learn right pronunciation by this method. I can't talk using English in such a state. Therefore, I thought the method that could learn meaning of the word and right pronunciation like the third example is wonderful. When I make vocabulary note next, I want to make it with this method."
1123,"After I read this article I knew how vocabulary note are good tool to study vocabulary. I'm not good at vocabulary, Then I realized my way of study vocabulary was not good, so that I will try first, second and third example of vocabulary note."
1124,"Vocabulary Notebook is very familiar with me, in particular ,when I studied for exam to enroll Keio univarsity.So I have own preference with it. It may be categorized in the first example on this article.However,I add part of speech to my notebook.And I would like Vocabulary Notebook to be compact to bring around in any time.That is because, I use very small notebook. As a result, I can see it on train with full people in morning. Finally, I want to conclude as this.'The best style is what you like.'"
1125,"I think example sentences are the most important of all. If I don't know the mean of the word, I can look up it in a dictionary. But it is only to know the mean of the word. The most important thing is understanding the way of using the word. We tend to be satisfied only to search the means, but we have to how to use and make example sentences after searching. I think there's no perfect method because all method doesn't include example sentences , but I have to choice one. So I choose word senses because it's the simplest method so it is quick and easy to do. But it also misses important information 'how to use'. So if I make vocabulary notebooks, I add not only means but also how to use. After looking up means, I try to make example sentences."
1126,"I think that we should learn example sentences together when we learn words. We may not understand how to use if we learn only a word. I think It has a meaning that we learned a word only after we can use it for a conversation. And then, I think that if we learn the same word of the meaning of a word, It is hard to forget the meaning and the method is efficient."
1127,I was surprised when I read this news. Plastic handgun can be made by 3D printer. So everyone can get plastic handgun easily if everyone become to use 3D printer. But plastic handgun is very dangerous and it can kill someone. So I think that government should not allow to make plastic handgun by 3D printer.
1128,I think after reading this topic that there are many way of leaning language. I had not thought way of leaning. And I remember that my English teacher told us to remember English words with sentence. I think that it is very important for me to lean English words with sentence. So I want to become to lean English words with sentence.
1129,"I think the news that the world's first gun made almost entirely by a 3D plastic printer has been successfully fired in Texas is very serious problem in the world. It is because plastic guns are cheaper than metal one. And also, you can make them easily if you have a 3D printer. So the peace might be broken by gangsters who have plastic guns. It is true that plastic guns are not as powerful as metal one because of the difference between raw materials. However, they would be powerful weapons because of technical innovation. Governments in the world should make building a gun with a 3D printer illegal."
1130,"This article is really interesting for me.When I was a high school student,I would often use Vocabulary Notebooks to pass university entrance exams.They are constituted by Japanese forms.However,this article insist that this forms are not efficient.Here,I think this is not true.Why? Because I have got the ability to write and read English by this Vocabulary Notebooks."
1131,"When I was candidate, I often made vocabulary notebooks. And my vocabulary notebooks are like the third example. I made much of word family when I made vocabulary notebooks. I think word family is one of the most important things when you make a vocabulary notebook. It is because you can learn a lot of expressions. So you can avoid using same expressions."
1132,"When I was studying English for entrance exams,I made my own vocabulary notebooks instead of using a wordbook on the market . I tried almost all of the styles that Mr.Marchand suggests on the article and incorporated all of them into my notebook. Naturally,it made me confused when reviewing the words because there were too much information.So from now on,I will try to make a simple but efficient word book like the examples and focus on the forth example in particular. Being too greedy is not good for learning words,I suppose."
1133,"I can't memorize many vocabulary. I always do to write the English words at the front, the Japanese words at the back. This way is the most famous way in Japan. But today I can study the a lot of way to learn vocabulary. I don't know the way of word map. I want to try it!!!"
1134,"I was impressed very much, when 3D printer was made. It is because 3D printer can make various things if a plan is got. However, 3D printer will also make a dangerous thing to us. This occurrence will give us fear. We should eliminate a dangerous plan from the Internet. And we would like to use wonderful 3D printer safely."
1135,"After I red this article except the last paragraph, I was surprised at the 3D plastic printer gun, and I think it will become very strong and portable weapon. But I red the last paragraph, I was angry that it became illegal. Of course The Undetectable Firearms Act is good law because any guns which cannot be found by metal detectors enable us to do an act of terrorism. So any guns which are not made of any metal is illegal. But the gun of Wilson is inserted metals, so metal detectors can find out it. In addition, 3D plastic printer gun has been successfully fired in test. So it has no problem about security. So I think it should be legal, and Undetectable Firearms Modernisation Act are illegal."
1136,"I think that printed handgun shouldn't be permitted. I don't intend to criticize American Gun Culture. But I think that gun should be use by adults who use for protecting themselves and their family. If printed handgun is spread,children can get handguns easily and children who don't know meaning and usage of gun have accidents. And simply,easier Americans get guns, more accidents are connected with guns happen. So I think printed handgun shouldn't be permitted."
1137,"There are various examples about the note of a vocabulary. I thought that it was very interesting. I was using the first method. It writes the meaning of a word and Japanese to a note. I have understood the meaning of the word. However, I cannot use a word well. I write the method of using a word to the note of a vocabulary. I thought that it was good for me."
1138,"It is wonderful technology to develop 3D-printed handgun.Many people probably don't imagine this new gun.We can make gun more easily with low material cost. However,this gun also have a lot of risks.Recently,the accident related with gun happened in U.N.More and more people think the gun should be regulated strictly than now.On the other hand,many people still think we should have guns for protection of own life.So the demand of the gun is high even now.Under this condition,it is difficult that we regulate illegal gun with 3D printer completely.We should know how to live safely in gun politics."
1139,"I made vocabulary notebook like the first example.I tried to write English meanings,but I was tired of writing them and it took much time.Finally,I wrote only Japanese meanings.I thought the second example was ideal but actually,if I made notebook by myself,I could memorize vocabularies. In conclude,I think we can learn vocabularies speedy and easily if we find own favorite way of making notebooks.To make it,we should try some examples and adopt an efficient idea."
1140,"I think that keeping vocabulary notebook is necessary to improve our English skill, because we may forget the words unless we review them a few times. However, I don't do it. whenever I encounter the word which I don't know or don't remember, I just search them in dictionary. It's because I think taking much time to make vocabulary notes is not good, while I think it's important. but, it's true that I don't know where to study for English vocabulary, though I need to them, because I didn't keep them. Therefore, I must begin keeping vocabulary notes with thinking how I don't waste time, and now one way has occurred to me. It's writing nothing but words I don't know. when I write on note, I search them in English- English dictionary, and check example sentences and listen to the pronunciations. When I study with the notebooks, I search it in the dictionary if I find the word I has already forgot. It's the best in the way to save time; I can take much time for the words which are difficult for me to memorize and I don't to have to spend time for the word which are easy for me to remember. Anyway, I think that each one has different character, must create the original way to keep vocabulary notes, and should continue amending it."
1141,"I read this article both comfortably and uneasily. Of course its very exciting that we'll be able to make 3D-printed gun far more easily and with less cost. But simultaneously this technology will be very very dangerous. A dangerous thing like this gun will be made too much easily by the normal people who buy this 3D-printer. Recently lots of incident have been led by gun in the U.S. for example. In even Japan,this sort of incident will be likely to increase by these technology. We must be cautious for this news."
1142,"Last year I studied English a lot for entrance exams.I used vocabulary notebooks example1.By reading this article,I think that I should use the second example type because I wanted to improve my reading skills.Also,I'd like to use other vocabulary notebooks."
1143,"It was really surprising to read this article. I got some knowledge about 3D printer at a museum in London, but I didn't know that even handgun can be made by it and 3D printer is so practical now. Of course, I agree with making 3D-printed handgun illegal. If handgun become available so easily, the number of killed people must increase much. I can't imagine the world people can acquire such a terrible one. However, I think it means that current technology are advancing highly, and we can apply in many place. For example, if we have a 3D printer at home, we can try shoes on, and it will make more common to buy something online."
1144,"I used to learn vocabulary by using Japanese meaning when I was high school student. And I still think that the most important element is Japanese meaning. But after reading this page,I began to think that it's good idea to learn English meaning at the same time. So I'm planning to do it from now on."
1145,"I used the vocabulary note like the first example. It isn't the best way to learn English vocabulary, but it's necessary to do so. In fact, English meaning of English word is necessary for English writing, but Majority of us need not study English writing well. Now, I study English to communicate with English people. To do so, it's more necessary to learn word's collocation, pronunciation. I'm going to use these ways."
1146,"When I read this article,I remembered that I used to made flash cards. But this way learning English vocabulary or words is not useful when I talk with people in English. So I think learned word's collocation is necessary!"
1147,"Come to think of it, I used the many kinds of methods to memory English vocabulary. At first, I made use of flash cards, but this way didn't fit me. As soon as I found out the fact, changed the way. Now, I think everyone should know the way which suits themselves."
1148,"I think we should make the international law about 3D-printed handgun. I thought it's very interesting to make handgun by 3D printer but it is also dangerous when I read this article . Furthermore, if technology progresses, a gun without metal will be made.I think. Then,what do we do? The gun is undetectable when it is tested by metal detectors. We cannot deal with the situation... In addition, American president, Mr.Obama, asserts to regulate to have gun in a whole nation. So,now I think we should make the international law about the gun and we will make safe using 3D printer."
1149,"Now, in America, the gun is illegal and most of people have it to protect themselves. It is no doubt the innovation will be the cause of encouraging the 'gun politics'. people would be able to get it cheaper and easier. Certainly, the technology is really amazing and surprising, but I'm afraid it would be abused by someone."
1150,"I was so scared hearing the news.It is like dynamite produced by Einstein which is used for war against his view. I think technology should be used for the purpose of improving our lives and affording us happiness. I know it is said that 3D printer has many worthless points. By using it, you can reduce the cost of trial manufacture,and you can produce easily an unique, only one thing in the world,such as private memorial things and so on. It is clear that it is never anything frightening us. Therefore,I agree with making building a gun with 3D printer illegal. I think the legislations should be introduced rapidly. In addition, I think that some function of 3D printer, which make it impossible to produce every arms, should be developed. we can't completely control lawbreaker, but we can lose the root."
1151,"If the 3-D printer prevail among public citizens,this type of guns will be easily available to anyone.For sure,we should strengthen the current law to prevent it.Laws,however,never have a power to stop crimes perfectly:in fact,laws against murder do not necessarily prevent it.So we have to come up with new effective measures that reinforce the laws as soon as we can;otherwise the crime rate will be assumed to be even higher in the near future and the tragedies like the terrorist attack in Boston will increase."
1152,"My way of making a vocabulary notebook is the first one. And when I was in high school, I used vocabulary note on the market. These are the easiest way and not troublesome. However, world map attracted me because it appeared to be a enjoyable way. Just remembering words is boring for me so word map might give me some new driving forces to study :)"
1153,"I like to learn how to study efficiently .So this article is very useful for me. When I was 'JYUKENSEI',I hoped to memorize new words as easy as possible.So if I had known contents of this article,I have been more intelligent."
1154,"When I read this article, I was surprised at the 80-year old Japanese mauntaineer.These days our life span is getting so long and Japanese people are getting aging.There are many elderly people who need nursing.I think that this article will encourage not only elderly people but also young people.Having read the news,I was stimulated by his action and statement. So I came to think that I would like to challenge and try things confronting with me,doing my best ,and to finish a full marathon race when I am 80 years old in the future.If many people including the elderly and young are stimulated or encouraged like I was,our society will be full of vitality."
1155,"I am proud of this great achievement because we Japanese get the position as the record holder of the world. I think climbing is a reason for living for Mr. Miura,and he seems to be enjoying climbing,so I want to have one thing which I can challenge my limits,too. Now I have a hobby of table tennis which I played through my junior high school and high school days. Therefore, I decided to challenge my limits through playing it and improving its skills. I also want to find more hobbies which make me so eager that make me quite well even when I get older."
1156,"His achievement was so amazing. I have never imagined such an old person could conquer a mountain. I respect his great challenging spirit and also be proud of him as a Japanese. Though he had hardship that he broke his pelvis and left thigh in 2009 and has also had a number of operations on his heart, he never gave up. It is admirable. At the same time, I am surprised that Mr Sherchan, now 81, is set to tackle the mountain again next week. They must be good friends as the competition because they spur each other. I think their friendship is wonderful, so I hope I will have such friends and live actively when I'm a octogenarian."
1157,"I was really surprised to hear that Japanese 80-year-old claimed Everest record.According to this article,'he said scaling Everest was about challenging his limits'.Challenging limits is important when you try to achieve your goal.You should fight you,not others.He taught us this idea by claiming Everest.I want to challenge my limits like him.However,I have already challenged my limits though university entrance exams.So,I should find a new goal.Eventually,my small goal is not to forget things now."
1158,"I have an 80-year old grandfather. He had practiced kendo and aikido in his school days. He's awfully good at doing kendo and aikido. In fact, he was the captain of the kendo club in University. But, in these years he has been bedridden. He becomes less energetic. After reading this article, I thought that Mr. Yuichiro is lucky and envied him. I want my grandfather to have the world's best feeling like Mr. Yuichiro. I am going to visit my grandfather this weekend, so I will tell him this story about Mr. Yuichiro. Mr. Yuichiro's achievements stimulate a competitive spirit. I hope this story bring my grandfather his vitality again."
1159,"I wrote the meaning of the word in the article in many cases. However, I thought that I would make a vocabulary note after reading this article. It is the important to collect after all the words which I do not understand."
1160,"When I read this article,I was very surprised and I thought we can make our dream come true unless we give it up. And his challenge that is very hard even if he is young so he should praise. I have ever climb the mountain is quarter as high as Everest but I took many hours to reach the top of this mountain so I remember to climb with desperately. That he achieves the feat like this is suppose to give much courage and many dreams to many Japanese elderly people. Japanese society is said that decreasing birthrate and aging population. By increasing elderly people,Japanese society may look like an exhausted condition. But,if this opportunity will make elderly people fine and activate society ,Japanese future will be bright."
1161,"When I was junior high school student, my teacher said 'We don't have to give up because of our age. I think 'I was too young to...' or 'I'm too old to...' are not the reason to don't difficult thing.' I was impressed. However Mr. Miura is fantastic, I wonder what makes climb the mountain him. By the way I think he has young and stout mind. I want to be the old man who has kiddy heart and keep challenging something. Congratulations Mr. Yuichiro Miura!"
1162,"I was very impressed by reading this article. I hadn't known that there is such a brave man like Mr. Miura in the world. Even though I am young and healthy, I would not try to reach the summit of Mount Everest now. I am too afraid to be in a situation which is dangerous, thrilling and tiring. Of course what Mr. Miura has done is rewarding. What I am proud of him the most is the fact that he has a great hobby at age 80! He thinks that he cannot be happier to be at the summit of Everest than anywhere else. I think it is wonderful for an elderly man to say so. I would like him to keep having a hope of going for a climb again and again in the future. His enthusiasm for mountaineering will have probably been giving many people motivation to live."
1163,"I was surprised at the news. If I were eighty, I would not think that I try to climb the mountain because I would not think that I want to take on my limits. So I respect him. Now, I do not know how person I will be when I will eighty, but I want to have challenging mind."
1164,"I think he is a great person and I respect him. However, I don't want to climb Mt.Everest. The reason why I don't want to climb Mt.Everest is I still don't want to die. Climbing is very dangerous. There is a possibility that a snow slide happen and there is little oxygen. What we can do is different each other. So I think we should do best on something.It's worth climbing Mt.Everest and it's enough."
1165,"I was so impressed by Yuichiro Miura's great achievement. I have not climbed high mountain. However, I understand climbing Everest is unimaginable hard and there is low possibility that healthy and young man achieve climbing Everest. Therefore, climbing Everest by Yuichiro Miura who is 80 years old and decline of his strength is unbelievable thing. I want to follow a his example and go over my limit."
1166,"When I heard this news for the first time, I can't believe it. Generally speaking, those who are 80 years old can't climb the mountains. However, Mr.Miura could climb Mt.Everest which is the highest mountain all over the world at age 80. Of course, his efforts brought him the remarkable feat of conquering Everest at age 80, but it is more important to keep having challenging spirit by age 80, in my opinion. Challenging spirit means that we have to make a great effort to try our limits. Maybe, it is more easy to think that there is a limit to what one person can do,but challenging limit is really difficult and too hard. So Mr.Miura is one of the great people in the world. When I am 80 years old, II want to be a challenging man, such as Mr.Miura."
1167,"I really respect Mr. Miura, who has kept challenging regardless of his age. In addition, he didn't give up scaling Everest though he broke pelvis and thigh and had a number of operations on his heart. Unlike him, most people, including me, generally don't challenge their limit, giving a plausible excuse. Mr. Miura's great achievement strongly showed that it is never too late to challenging your limit. I believe that his challenging spirit inspired not only elderly people yet young people to challenge their limit. I would like to study harder toward my goal in the future, and also would like to keep challenging at the age of 80."
1168,"First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miura for his great achievement. I can't believe an 80-year old man scaled the highest mountain in the world. Moreover, I have to take my hat off to him for challenging spirit or motivation. Although it seems to be broken his record soon again, I feel like Mr. Miura will try it several years later. Also, in my opinion, the record is only a by-product of his effort,"
1169,"Also, in my opinion, the record is only a by-product of his effort, the most important thing about his various achievements is to encourage people to do anything irrespective of one's age. Probably he himself also has such a mind. I can't understand old people's distress very well because I am still young. However his activity and behavior undoubtedly inspired me to greater effort and energy."
1170,"I was surprised at this news and I think he is a great person and I respect him.However, I don't want to climb Mt.Everest. Because I still don't want to die.Climbing is very dangerous. There is a possibility that a snow slide happen and there is little oxygen.But Mr.Miura is one of the great people in the world. When I am 80 years old, I eager to be a challenging man, such as Mr.Miura."
1171,"when I heard that an 80-year old Japanese mountaineer has reached the summit of Mount Everest, I was very surprised.And I got courage from him. He taught me to continue challenging his dream irrespective of age. However, I cannot believe his physical strength or efforts which are 80 years old."
1172,"I was surprised to hear that news. His achievement encourage many people in the world. Mr. Miura tried difficult thing. If I were him,I could not think such a thing.I think everybody should have courage to try things like Mr.Miura. I hope the world will be filled with dream."
1173,"I respect Mr.Miura for his spirit to never stop challenging. Generally, old people stop challenging for their age and only tell and yearning for their heroic episodes which they made when they were young. I don't say their habits are bad, but Mr.Miura's positive attitude is wonderful and I want to follow his example."
1174,"I was so surprised when I watched this news on TV first time.I doubt it is possible for 80 years old man to climb Mt.Everest. But Mr.Miura did!! I am proud of him because he gave hope to many people, of course he gave it to me also. I want to be a man like him and would do some great thing in the future."
1175,"This new makes me excited very much. There is many bad news in Japan recently. But,this news will encourage many people. And I understand the importance of 'Challenge'. I am not good at playing sports and can not do things like Yuichiro Miura . But I want to challenge many things from now. First ,I must study English harder."
1176,"It is incredible that the man 80-year-old climbed Everest. I think his courageous challenge cheer many old man. In that sense,there is opinion that he can get a People's Honor Award. I also agree with that opinion,and think his feat deserves that."
1177,"I am surprised at his stamina. If I am same his age, I would only spend every day watching TV at home. So his challenge is not easy task. I was encouraged to it! I thought I want to live in active everyday as I would not regret everyday!"
1178,"I was so surprised and excited at this news.Mr. Miura broke our fixed ideas that the elderly cannot always do whatever they like.Moreover, he showed us the idea that we can do anything when we try it in earnest.The age, gender, or nationality are entirely not related to your challenge.If you want to make it, you only do it at your best.He set a personal example about it."
1179,"I think Mr.Miura is the proud of Japan. He had bore many hardships and finally made his dream come true. Surprisingly, he is now 80! I'm much more younger than him, but I have never dreamed of climbing Mt.Fuji, much less Mt.Evelest! We can learn many things from his challenge to Mt.Evelest."
1180,"Just amazing!I can hardly imagine that an old man older than me by 50,60 years old not only tried climbing mt. Everest but also reached the top!He is a man of strong will .I think I should learn from him and try many things and won't give up. I must live my life more preciously,exert all my strength to live."
1181,"I'm proud of him as a Japanese. He showed the fact that effort lets us conquer everything. And I praise him especially for having tried to go beyond his own records and having said scaling Everest was honouring 'the great Mother Nature'. This spirit is needed now,the time human beings aim to defeat nature,by developing science technology."
1182,"I do not like mountain climbing very much. Therefore think that that he intends to climb the mountain is great beside he is 80 years old. Probably his record would can blunder immediately, but his action taught a Japanese the importance of 'a challenge' and 'the effort'. when I read this sentence, I think that I wanted to do many sports when I'll become an old man.It is important for all age to challenge and to effort. I wanted to challenge something with every effort, too."
1183,"I was surprised at this news and I think his achievement is amazing. This news gave huge power to the old people. Not so many people have ever imagined that such an old people could claim Mt.Everest. He should be proud of himself. I think it is amazing that he has a great life even he gets so old. A lot of old people have no energy to try something big. After I read this article, I thought that I want to keep trying something new even after I get so old."
1184,"I can't believe that the old man reached the world's highest peak , nevertheless it is difficult for the young and powerful people. Furthermore he accomplished three times! I was also surprised that not only he but Nepali man challenged a such a crazy thing. their tough body and challenging spirit are so amazing. I was impressed so much.The news would motivate many people. In fact, I understand what Mr.miura says,but, I would like to spend time leisurely with my lovely grandchildren at the peaceful and safe place,not at the peak of mountain, in my old age:)"
1185,"I believed that people have an impossible thing. But this news made me think about possibility of human! I think to climb needs a lot of physical strength, so an old man can't do it, and I have never doubt such a thing. This maybe made people the wall of impossibility. But today this wall was broken! I can try a lot of thing not to make the wall. Today, people have a wall of impossibility, But I suggest 'Try something before to think!"
1186,"I was very surprised at his vitality. When I heard the news, I couldn't believe that Mr.Miura really climbed Mount Everest even though he was 80 years old. I respect him very much. If I come to be his age, I want to have vitality as he has. I like cycling. So if I have vitality when I'm old, I could enjoy cycling through my life. I think such life must be very fun. I want to enjoy my life like him."
1187,"When I read this article, I think that he is superhuman for his age. Because I can not imagine that old person like 80 years old will do such a hard thing. And if I were 80 years old, I would not do so. If anything, his challenge should be honored.I strongly think that he is great."
1188,This article made me encouraged. What would I be doing at age of 80. I want to enrich the college to become cool old man. And I want to be enrich the life. Therefore I have to have sense of purpose always. By doing so I able to get a sense of satisfaction when I'm 80 years old.
1189,"I can't image when I am 80. I was surprised at this news. I thought Yuichiro Miura is a great Japanese. But actually,I can't know true value of his great achievement. Because I am 18 yet. I can't know how person's 80s is. So I can't image what become of my body and mind when I am 80. I hope to be like Yuichiro Miura when I am 80."
1190,"When I was a junior high school student, I belonged to the hiking club. So I climbed many mountains and know how hard we climbing. Though he is 80-year-old, he challenged the world's highest peak. I am surprised at his challenging spirit. I follow a his spirit and want to keep my challenging spirit like his."
1191,I think that it is not easy for man who is 80 years old to climb mountain. Because climbing a mountain needs effort and training. And old man does not have physical strength. So it is difficult for old man to continue to train. But Mr. MIURA climbed mountain. So I think that he continued to strive every day. I don't keep working hard now. So I want to be a man like Mr. MIURA.
1192,"I respect Mr. Miura. I think that it is very difficult to train the body even if it becomes advanced age. I think that I continue wanting him to continue to challenge. Even if a world record is broken, I would gain the summit once again and would like you to break record."
1193,"Mr. Miura is a wonderful person. I have climbed a mountain. I think that it was serious for 80 year old Mr. Miura to climb Mount Everest. However, probably, Mr. Miura looked at the scene from a very beautiful scenery. It could also be said that the spectacle is equivalent to a life for Mr. Miura surely."
1194,"I think Mr. Miura is great because he is not satisfied after his dreams come true and he has continued challenging. However, I felt that not only he but also his son was great. Ordinary, if own old father challenges a dangerous thing,son and daughter persuade him to stop challenging, but he support his parent and climbed together putting himself to danger. I think he is an understanding son. I think this great achievement was accomplished thanks to the son's support as well as his perseverance."
1195,I was so surprised at his achievement. He said 'scaling Everest was about challenging his limits and honoring.' I think his courage is modeled by not only old people but also young people. He teach us that the efforts would pay off.
1196,"When I read this article, I couldn't believe Mr. Miura's action. I don't like mountain climbing because it is very dangerous and there is a possibility of death. However he climbs mountain at 80 years old. When the human gets older, a physical ability and a judgment ability decrease. He climbs the highest mountain in the world in spite of this fact. That's suicidal! It is surely good that there are a dream and an aim. However, I do not want to do only the dangerous thing such as the his action. I want to live long"
1197,"I believe that challenging our limit is great thing, so I respect Yuichiro Miura. It was really surprising that an 80-year old man scaled Mt Everest. However, I don't think that holding record such as height and age are not so important. each should consider about what can be his limit and don't have to do too dangerous thing for him. Despite his body problem, Mr. Miura achieved it, but I think he was just lucky. It was possible for him to die. Therefore, I think that challenging something is good, but It will involve some risks, so each should make own goal, and try it."
1198,"It is true that gun made by 3D printer is very useful, especially we can make it with low cost and easily.But if it is spread in the world,we can't sleep comfortably and even go around own house. We never allow it."
1199,"I think his challenge gave us big brave. We will naturally be old. It is general phenomenon. But even if we are old, whether we challenge actively or not is depend on us. Mr. Shimomura did challenge difficult thing actively. We can follow his example after this."
1200,"I was really surprised about this news. This I's because I have 80 years old grandfather, but he can't even climb steep slope. So that 80 years old man claim Everest is unbelievable news. I was also glad to hear this news because it shows how Japanese old people are healthy and vigorous. This news led to Japan's good image. So I think his achievement is really great."
1201,"I was really surprised to hear this news.When I will become 80 years old, I cannot climb Everest . So I think that he got himself into shape everyday.I respect his sportsmanship!!I follow his example,I also work harder. I am young now,I would like to climb Everest only once."
1202,"I don't like making tool for memorize or study because I think it is a waste of time .So I seldom make a word list. But I think it would be good to make a word list.'word families' and 'English meanings' are important to know a lot of English word.Maybe another elements are also important to be a good English speaker,I think."
1203,"After I red this article, I was surprised at that the man whose age is 80 can climb Mount Everest. I imagine when I am 80 years old, the exercise hardest of what I can do is only walking. So I think it is too hard for old man to climb mountain. In addition the mountain which he climbed is highest all over the world! But it is not only his effort but also his family's support. If I am his fall, I may stop him. So his family's trust made the challenge possible. Recently we can hear 'family's ties' example for example the story of earthquake in Fukushima. But this story is the most impressing story for me."
1204,I was so much impressed by his success. It is the miracle that a 80-year-old man is strong and brave like him. I wish I would be such a strong man when I am 80-year-old.
1205,"Even Naomi Uemura, who was one of the best climber in the world, reached the summit of Mt.Everest when he was about 30 years old and the summit of Mt. McKinley when he was 43 years old (and disappeared). Yuichiro MIura is NOW 80 years old and reached the summit of Mt.Everest. This accomplishment is utterly above the ordinary. If he was questioned 'why you climb mountains?', there was no wonder he will answer like this: 'Because it is there' ."
1206,"This news is so amazing because such a old man can climb the highest mountain. His challenge was on TV and I was moved by his brave. I'm sure that his success must energize many people.Moreover, after his summit, he said that he wants to skiing next climbing."
1207,I think he is the greatest man in Japan. His achievement gave me brave and hope. There is nothing too late to do. We should try to something forever.
1208,"I saw this news many times on TV.I was really surprised at his challenge.I thought that his record encourage elderly people to try something new.He also makes me change my image of life of after retire.I think i will not do same dangerous thing,but I want to have curiosity as well as him."
1209,"I made vocabulary notes when I was a high school student. That note concluded Japanese meanings, accent and pronunciation. I read this news and thought I should have written collocations on that note. However, I hardly had reviewed the note. I used 'TARGET 1900' to memorize English word. I don't know whether it is good or not."
1210,"It was shocking for me to hear that more and more people are complaining about the noise of children, as Japanese society ages. However, it was interesting to know the reason why compliments are increasing: aging society makes people less accustomed to hearing and tolerating the noise of children. This should be taken seriously in Japan today, because declining birth rates could be worsened by the problem. If many people keep the stance, young women will not have a choice but to give up child-bearing. Then, the number of taxpayers who have to pay for social security will decrease, while the number of elderly people is increasing rapidly. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi mentioned in the passage. We really have to push child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda to make people think more and more children are needed for future Japan. I would also like them to notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises."
1211,"Japan has a problem now.It is aging Japan.These days the number of children is decreasing and the number of older people is increasing.The number of labors in Japan will be decreasing in the future if this situation is continuing.It is high time we started to take steps against this problem. However,'aging Japan complains over the noise of children'.In other words,'As Japan's population declines, intolerance of children and the noise they make is increasing in a society getting less accustomed to hearing them'.This is a serious problem.We should have a wider mind. If we cannot do that,Japan will not continue to stay superpower in the world.Why? Because old people play by money,but they cannot make money.Young people can make money and support old people.So,now young people is needed.Consequently,we must be tolerant of the noise of children."
1212,"Several years ago, I saw a news about him but he was 75 years old. Although, he was known as the oldest climber to the Mount Everest. So I was so surprised at this age. I can't imagine the spirit to keep No.1 at any place. On the other hand, I read about Mr Sherchan's article. He had won the record until Mr Miura won the newest record. According to the article, he couldn't get any sponsors and he was forced to give up his challenge. I felt that it is so severe that unless he is No.1, to get sponsors becomes harder."
1213,"I got angry about the complainers. Children are noisy by nature, and they learn many things by playing and romping. I think declining birthrate seem to make less interest in children. I realized why the declining birthrate is becoming a big issue. Japanese people pay too much attention to their businesses and less attention to their kindnesses. And the national character caused the results. Should we demand reparation for child's growth? Should we require fines when we are disturbed our silence? If people have a little wider mind, the troubles will decrease and Japanese birthrate may increase."
1214,"To tell the truth, I was often uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and because of that they should be noisy. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. I think the number of children who are noisy because they try to get their own way is increasing recently. That's I was upset about those noisy children. However, after read this news story, I thought there was some truth in what it said. I agreed with Maeda, who said fewer children makes people less accustomed to hearing the noise they naturally make. I also agreed with Hosaka, who said, 'Of course we need to be considerate towards people living in the neighborhood, but it is impossible to make places where children play in total silence.' So, it's may be important that we come in contact with children and give more chance or place for them to play actively."
1215,"I agree that children are not a social nuisance. Children betray their straight feelings, that's why they are vigor and noisy. But we adult no longer have that candidness. If children became keeping quiet like a doll, the world would lose energy. I think the noise which youngsters make have a power to make people cheerful. In additional, the housings nearby school or daycare center must be reduced the price. So people living in the neighborhood should tolerate some noise."
1216,"I also think that it is true that it is impossible to ask children to sit still all day long so they do not make noise. I do not like children because they always make noise.But I understand it is what cannot be helped. So,parents should discipline a child so as to children will not be put to shame in the future. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of children depend on the disciplining of children by parents."
1217,"It is natural that children make some noise when playing outside. Those who complain about the noise children make definitely used to make noise and sometimes used to bother their neighbors when they were children. In addition, I think people should realize that not just parents but all the people in a whole society are responsible for education of children. When I was an elementary school student, I played outside with my friends living nearby my house every day. Their parents and elderly neighbors always greeted playing children and made us greet them back. Moreover, sometimes they told us to be careful of cars and bicycles, not to damage walls and flower beds, and not to make too much noise. Through these kinds of communication with neighbors, my friends and I learned manners in a society. I really appreciate my neighbors who brought me up in a different way from my parents' or school's ones. Recently, it has come to be difficult to help young parents and bring up children by a whole society. However, people have to understand how hard taking care of children is, and afford to worry about young parents and children. I hope that people keep a warm eye on them and communicate with them more frequently so that the number of complaints will decrease."
1218,"I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and,should be allowed. First,It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children ,and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birthrate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood when , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan."
1219,"This might sound 'incorrect' but I am rather a person who complains about the noise of children. Those noises are simply annoying especially in crowded places. Moreover, I dislike a sort of common sense that everybody should like children and be kind to them. If I say that I don't like kids, many people will think that I'm a cold-hearted person. It is obvious that the declining birthrate problem is serious, tho. To solve the problem, a fundamental reform for the overpopulation in the metropolitan cities, such as Tokyo, is needed. The government cannot force its citizens to be tolerate of the noise children make, but it can lead them by reducing the stress of their life in overcrowded cities."
1220,"I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and,should be allowed. First,It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully.

Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birthrate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan."
1221,"I also feel uncomforted because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children is natural things, so I can allow it and it is unbelievable that a lot of people complain about the noise of children. Therefore, I want many people who complain about it to remind of their childhood and kindness of neighborhood."
1222,"I think the government, daycare centers and the neighbors should make every effort to overcome this issue. The government should inform more neighbors and other people of the risks that low birthrate and aging society brings such as problems of pensions or decline of the laboring population. And the daycare centers should take measures to avoid the conflict. For example, they should more often take children to remote parks where children can play without caring others. And the neighbors should find some hobbies they can enjoy outside the houses where they do not feel unpleasant. The noise causes mainly in the daytime, so the neighbors should go out actively."
1223,"I think that the noise children make should be allowed. It is unfair of people to take children to task for their noise, because most people make noise when they are children. In fact, it is natural that children make noise, so it is impossible to ask children not to make noise. In my opinion, the noise is important for children. When children play with their friends, they are sure to make noise. In other words, the noise is their means of communication that they can express their feelings. Therefore the noise is indispensable for growing up. Of course, their parents need to pay attention to their noise, but it is quite wrong for their neighborhoods to sue them. We don't think the method of decreasing the noise, but we ourselves have to be more tolerant of their noise. If Japan is more broad-minded toward children and their parents, its birthrate will be increasing."
1224,"I think the noise of children is natural things. We should be tolerant for the noise of children because everyone made noise when they were children.In the first place,a man who is not able to allow this noise must cause trouble for someone in no small way. To allow each other is important."
1225,"It's true that people feel it noisy if children play outside. And it often happens to me when I study at home and It is disturbing, but I think we have to bear their noise because it's natural and everyone used to be like this. On the other hand, people have to care their children not to disturb neighborhood at night and in early morning. According to this article, there are many complaints about children's noise now. I think it is problem about not only low birthrate but also weak neighborhood's bond. In old days, people can be tolerant to the noise maybe because they know about each other. children are more noisy but much purer than usual people. And If people spend a few minutes with children and know their purity, they can put up with their noise."
1226,"I was shocked by having got to know this fact. 'We were once told not to take the children for a walk' because they make too much noise',said Ms.Maeda.I thought that it was amusing. Naturally it is things that a child frolics. And it is because it is wrong to consider that it is noise. However, although Japan has various problems therefore, it is such a situation. I think that there is probably the necessity that a child understands that it is not social trouble."
1227,"Come to think of it, in my childhood, my parents told me 'go outside rather than stay home'. I used to had a lot of time near my house. The neighborhood maybe felt so noisy, but My neighborhood have never got angry with me For the children, playing with their friends are essential for their mental or physical growth. Certainly, they sometimes don't notice their wrongdoing. At that time, people should point out to them. I'm sure such a tolerance of children is necessary in our society."
1228,"Recently the number of people who cannot tolerate something has been increasing. I'm from Wakayama, where is not so dense with people.Therefore the number of people who complain about the noise that children make is small. When I was an elementary schoolchild, I played in the school ground, but residents near the school didn't complain. I think this problem is not only because a declining birthrate but also a population density."
1229,"I'm sad to know such a complaints get increasing in Japan. As far as the idea is majority in our society, we cannot stop Japan's bad progress for more aged country and we can never re-improve the birthrate. Of course, some complaints are unreasonable and others are reasonable, so I am not going to deny all their criticism about the noise children often make. Still, I insist people should permit children to play outside merrily at least during the daytime because it is the most important activity for children to grow up soundly. Maybe different from many parents' opinion, it is not the most significant education to force their child to study hard from early age. This is because a toddler learns surprisingly numerous things voluntarily. Therefore we had better not restrict children's spontaneity."
1230,"When I read this article, I never believe there are people who accuse about noise at the court. It is natural that children make a noise. When people who hate a noise are childhood, did they not make the noise at all? Such a thing is impossible. When I was young, I made noise at a house, a kindergarten, a road, a shop, a train too. I think that children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly"
1231,"I thinks that there is no help for it that a child is noisy. It is recognition to raise a child in Great Society not to be enough in present Japan. We should be gentle for the noise of the child more. However, I can understand the feeling of a person thinking that child is noisy. It is that a parent warns a child with moderate condition to be important. It is wrong to complain for a parent making an effort."
1232,"When I read this article,I was shocked to know there are complains about the noise of children. But thinking carefully,I have also complains over it and do not like children because they are so noisy.Calmly thinking, I realized I should change my idea.Children go through so many and various things outside.In that way,they develop their senses and grow up robustly.The complain will put pressure on people having children .However, Japan has the lowest rate of children in the world.Accoding to this article,Japan will be aging and will get less used to hearing children.I am afraid of the future of my country.Children make the future of the country.Considering this problem,I agree with the idea of Kuniko Inoguchi. I thought people should think about the complain over once more and understand that children are not a social nuisance.By pushing child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda, we need to decline the number of the people who think the complain are acceptable and to form a society filled with hope."
1233,"When I read this article,I felt that modern society has lost tolerance,so I felt disappointed. Everyone was a child and everyone has experience that plays outside and speaks in a loud voice.In spite of this,as they become adults,so they lose their memories of childhood. That there are many adults are uncomfortable with the noise of children is real. I think society like this accelerate more and more aging society with fewer children. Because young people loses the feeling that wants to give birth to and bring up children. Therefore if we can remember our childhood just a little bit,the noise of children may not become a social problem like this. To continue Japanese society we should have tolerance and it is necessary to make the environment people easy to bring up children."
1234,"First,I'm surprised at the expression of 'noise'. I have never thought the sound children make outside noisy,so I have never call it noise. And it is unbelievable that people complain over it just because they aren't used to it. In my opinion,children are precious for all Japanese people,facing aging society,so we should be more tolerant toward their voice and sound."
1235,"Reading this article, I feel that Japanese people have become to lose their tempers easily not only for the noise of children.For example, on the jam packed train, some people get angry for others' hand touching his body with strong.Moreover, other people get angry even for bumping others on the street.As for the noise of children, they get more angry than usual. As the article says, one of the reasons for these situations is the law birthrate.It seems to me that this problem is one of the most important problems that Japan has to solve as early as possible.The law birthrate means the small labor force in the future.As a result, Japan will get less revenue than now, and be obliged to reduce the scale of market. To solve this problem, we should promote the nation's welfare, especially child welfare.Concretely, we should increase the number of nursery schools and admit the childcare leave.Furthermore, to allow children to play to their hearts' contents, each of us should overlook the noise of children."
1236,"Compared with other noises,it is easy to make a complaint to the noise of children. I think it is necessary to generate the atmosphere that we should cherish the children foe an investment for the future . So,I want the justice to rule in favor of children."
1237,"When I read this article, I was surprised by the intolerance of the complainer. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot.Maybe, my and my friend's voice were noisy,but I hadn't be scolded for the noisy. Furthermore, we were praised that 'You are cheerful.Children should be so.' These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience."
1238,"I think those opinions in the article are kind of extreme arguments. I don't think low birthrate and feeling of young people that they don't want to have a child are caused by only this noise problem. Although the number of waiting children for day care centers became zero in Yokohama these days,it is not enough yet in Japan. The number of childcare workers and public facilities like parks are also not enough. The social system that women can feel easy to work hasn't be established yet. Therefore, I think it's not Just about intolerance and just saying children are not social nuisance won't solve the condition.Tough I understand that people who can't tolerate noises and sue are not ordinary and normal, and that it is natural for children to make din, of course. To tell the truth,I can also agree with their feelings,I can't help to be irritated if I always have to hear the bit. I think where the day care center is opened is clue to solve the problem. In my living city,elementary school and kindergarten are next-door and house are away from there. I know,in sprawling city it is difficult to do.... To sum up, it is so complicated that I can't say high-sounding ideas like we should tolerate for the future!"
1239,↑ ×bit ○din or noise
1240,"In Japan , the number of children is decreasing yearly. That is why people tend not to bear the noise of children. But, it is wrong that being intolerance about the noise of children. Because all the people used to be children and make a noise. In spite of this fact , complaining over the noise of children is somewhat strange. To solve this problem , the way to co-exist between children and the others should be thought."
1241,"I can understand children's feeling to play outside and make some noise because I used to be like them and do like them. Every adults was a child and they shouted more than children who live now. I cannot understand why they complain children. As Japan's population declines, we should be kind to children and their parents. If more people don't want to have their kids, Japan would become weaker."
1242,"I think that noisy children is better than quiet children.Of course,romp is not good. Children can become noisy because they are healthy and obedient. If too pay attention to others when childhood, will save a stress. Anyway, parents have to pay attention to neighbors for good relations of neighbors. It should be happening never that children are accused."
1243,I think why the noise of children attracts somebody's attentions now. I want to question how was the old days! I think nothing can be done about it. Children are such creatures as making a noise. It is a process in which all people has passed. We should endure it more. Because children set a limit to play outside. I think the government should make the society more livable for children. And then population that children aged between 0 and 14 years old will increase.
1244,"It is common that the children are noisy. I think most children cannot sit still for a long time. It is also common that many people dislike noise of children. I like children and I cannot understand people who dislike children, but they are not ill-natured. I hope that all people come to understand children."
1245,"The place I'm living has many children, so we can hear voice of children playing and baby's crying voice. Those sound let me be warm feeling and make my smile. Neighbor's baby is so cute and kids are so funny, so I like this place. When I was elementary school student, I was a member of the club of baseball, so I played baseball every weekend and I played in the park with my friends.We run in the park, throw the ball, ride on a swing and climb a tree.There are my cherished memory. I learned 'what is friendship' by playing with my friends. But now, many park ban ball playing, and we have few place to play baseball or football. Where can children play? A decade ago, children can play on the road, and they had a conversation with neighbors.At the time, people helped each other, and town was peace. By contrast, we don't greet with neighbors. I think it is not just a problem between children and neighborhood, it is serious issue of society as a whole. Old man in Japan increase future, many aged person need assistance, so we have to help to each other in the neighborhood. And I want to ask the person who complaining to children's voice sounds, when you will be old, who help you? It is a young man isn't it? They are kids now, so we have to make a environment that is easy to child rearing."
1246,I think that everyone knows and understands that children make noise. But this noise is like the evidence that they live and it is no use complaining. So I am very surprised at the content of this article. The people who are complaining about this forget to be brought freely with making noise and be watched by adults who didn't feel angry or stress. They should recall their childhood and tolerate.
1247,"I was surprised when I read this article. I do understand why people complain about the noise of kids but I think they should be a little bit more tolerant. Kids make noise by nature and they learn a lot of things by playing outside cheerfully. I think most of the people have the same experiences. I agree with the statement 'As society has fewer and fewer children, people get less used to hearing them. It's a vicious circle.' I think the society is making the situation worse. If there will be less children, there will be less taxpayers in the future. We need to take this problem seriously to make our future better."
1248,"I think that low birthrate and longevity are a problem which must be solved. However, they are not easy problems. It is necessary to fight against this problem not only by the party concerned but by a society as a whole. Japan is not in the environment which child-rearing tends to carry out. I am anxious about the future of Japan as at now. I think that low birthrate and longevity are the subject assigned to us."
1249,"I was very surprised that declining birth rate causes such a problem. I like children. However, I can understand people's complaints that children are too noisy because they have high-pitched voices and talk loudly. But most people can satisfy about it because children cannot help making noise. I think that this problem is caused by people being narrow-minded in recent years."
1250,"I like a child. Children are noisy. However, I think that such a portion also has loveliness. They must also have had the same time. The residents of the area should have attachment to nearby children. Then, the children should help you in the future."
1251,"It is unbelievable that people in Japan complain of noise children make.It is true that that noise make people uncomfortable. But people in the world absolutely experience childhood. At that time, we all did trouble. In spite of this, complaining about children is wrong.We should see them with warm eyes."
1252,"When I read this article, I was surprised and I think that there is no help for it that children are noisy. We should be gentle for the noise of the children more. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe,our voice were noisy,but I had not be scolded for the noisy. These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience."
1253,"I was very surprised to hear this news and would like to pay my great respect to Mr.Miura. It is not easy to try to challenge our own limits.Unlike him,most of us hate and are afraid to know them.When we are faced with challenging tasks,we tend to feel like giving them up immediately. Also,It is so hard for the elderly people to keep themselves in good health. Today Japan's population is aging quickly.I hope such news will inspire all the elderly people."
1254,"After I red this article, I understood the reasons of decreasing birthrate are not simple. The reasons which I had known are only women's advances into society and a tendency to marry later, but this article taught me a society getting less accustomed to hearing intolerance of children. But it is natural that the voices of children are noisy and I can admit them because children are so cute. So I think the recent people become not to think children are cute. But it is difficult to make others think children are cute. I think the solution of this problem is making a lot of chances to play with children when we are young for example junior high school student goes to a kindergarten or a nursery school as a class. Actually I went to the near nursery school as a class, of course children are so noisy , but moreover children are cute. I think what we make such a chance makes people like and want children."
1255,"I think it is natural that children always cry out, because their job is to play and to be scalded. They don't know something, so if people scold, they can know something. In Japan, people are aging. people perhaps think 'what is bad?' But it is very bad! For example if old people increase, who make buildings?, who rescue?, who save a town? So, people should make baby for Japan."
1256,"I think it is natural thing that children are noisy and restless, but I agree about the feeling of people who complains over the noise of children. When I studying restaurant or cafe, I am irritated at children who are running around the shop. Birth rate in Japan is decreasing year by year, so we get less used to hearing children noise. Then, we are unused to children's noise and feel annoying to that. So that the basis of the problem is Japanese declining birth rate. We need to think more seriously about that problem and find the way to solve that problem."
1257,"I think we should involved in making a good environment in which people are tolerant to the noise of children. I have two reasons for this. First, what we can do to cope with the problem which article says is to change the way of peoples' thinking, because it is impossible to ask children not to make any noise . Children are immature and being silent is really hard for them, so when when we tackle this problem , it is not children but adult that should change. Second, we should prevent trouble that intolerance of noise of children results in vicious circle. In Japan the birthrate are getting lower, so we have to take action for this by making people tolerant to the noise. Because of these two reasons, I think people should change their mind and try to make the environment which is good for education."
1258,"<p>Reblogged this on <a href='http://newsbased.wordpress.com/2013/06/10/aging-japan-complains-over-the-noise-of-children-2/' rel='nofollow'>News Based English</a> and commented: </p> <p>I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem. </p>"
1259,"I sometimes feel that children's voice is noisy. However , We have to accept it.By accepting it, children will grow up freely. It is unavoidable to stop decreasing population so we have to increase the number of children. In order to do so,we should make the environment where children play freely."
1260,"I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem."
1261,It is natural that children and old people in a same society. And you cannot reject children. Cannot reject the natural phenomenon that children make noise. Now Japan is facing super aging society.We must coexistence with all age people. And it is fact that we should make environment that aging people comfortably living to.
1262,"I think the noise of children is natural and we have to tolerate it.Then,we should not take it as a noise but as a part of live. We all made noise when we were children.But now,people who don't be accustomed to hearing it complain about the noise. Although they also didn't play completely silence. Government should inform people of the problem of declining birthrate more.If people understand the importance of children,they will make efforts to protect them and make atmosphere which they grow up healthy."
1263,"I think it's amazing and powerful news Mr.Miura encouraged not only aged people but also young people. He said 'If the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never be happier,' His word inspired many people and lighted the people who have been disappointed in their life. I hope the world become more happier."
1264,"I think it's big issue when I read the article. There are two points. First, birth rate. Recently, Japanese birthrate has been decreasing and the number of children is more uncommon than before. so, the noise of children can be more irritate people. Second, education problem A large number of mother have to do all things about their children by social system. So, in many cases fathers should work on day time and only mother should look after their children. I think we should solve these problem. For example, we make many space for children and mother etc.."
1265,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know the fact that the measures taken in Abenomics is not always good for people. The influence of cheap yen is one good example. Therefore I want current government to act carefully when doing economical measures. Also I want it to think carefully about the change of the current constitution. Anyway, through this news, I felt that I people should see things from various perspectives. From now on, before I do actions, I want to reconsider about them carefully."
1266,"I cannot understand this article at all because I do not know 'Abenomics' at all. What only things I know 'Abenomics' are 'a financial policy' and 'monetary policy' and 'a growth strategy'. No clear picture about it comes to mind. But judging from the news, I think that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before."
1267,"Shamefully, I hardly know 'Abenomics', so I investigate that system and effect on the Internet. In my opinion, 'Abenomics' will probably fail. The key point of the Abenomics is The Trans-Pacific Partnership 'TPP', which is one of the most ambitious free trade agreements ever attempted. It is a proposed free trade deal currently being negotiated between 11 countries. These are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, United States, Singapore and Vietnam. It is expected to boost investment flows between the countries and further boost their economic growth. But, the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country."
1268,"I think 'Abenomics' is good plan.Of course the price of every things is rising.However,in the long run,salaries of people will be raising by companies.People should wait for good results from long term point of view.It is because people wanted good results so early by now.Japanese people should have patience.In addition,only aiming for sensation,the mass media should not stir up worries of people."
1269,"I have thought that 'Abenomics' is very wonderful policy, because I have not known about 'Abenomics' well. So I learned many things of it from this article and realized that 'Abenomics' is not always beneficial for the citizens, it also has disadvantages at the same time. In future, there will be a lot of controversy which 'Abenomics' is success, or not. However, I believe that it is the right policy for us, so I'd like to support it and hope the Japanese society will recover."
1270,"Before I read this article, I got a negative impression because there's no guarantee that inflation would lead the economy to recovery. There also might be a possibility of stagflation as Shukan Post (June 14) said. Now, through this article, I'm still wondering if the policy is precarious because Shukan Post points out another problem with 'Abenomics.' It says that Japanese exporters' slightly rosier situation has failed to spread to other sectors because they haven't had a more favorable exchange rate. Of course, it is important to make drastic reforms to change the society, so it doesn't mean I criticize all this policy, but there may be a necessity to think more about the problems."
1271,"I was shocked to read this news. Before I read this article, I believed Abenomics are good for Japan because it can help us to recover from deflation.But after reading this article,I was shocked to hear that Abenomics can lead to stagflation.If this article is true,Abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all.I think we should discuss the Abenomics and find solution for these problems."
1272,"It's really difficult to study economics, and I don't know about it very much, it's so complicating. Therefore, I can't judge whether Abenomics is good for economy in Japan or not, but it seems a problem to rise not salaries but prices, which must hit us all. However, nobody knows what will happen in the future because of Abenomics, and I think it better thing to change something in any situation. It's natural to have both good and bad side in changing something, so It needs some bravery, and many people tend to want not to take a risk. Thus, in my opinion instituting Abenomics is better than conducting nothing. It has a chance to make our economy revival because nothing will happen unless we do something."
1273,"I sometimes watch news of ''Abenomics.'' In that news, some people say '' Business is improving'', but other people say '' I don't think business is improving.'' I don't know ''Abenomics'' well, but the rise in prices of everything is big problem for me. I started living apart from my family from this April, and I came to care the prices. I try to buy cheaper daily necessities, so a price rise bothers me. I hope the consumption tax won't rise."
1274,"I did not understand all about 'Abenomics'. But, I think it may be a mere facade that the media makes.The stock price and yen's worth true rose, but they were only temporary.Now, many problems happen. So, we must understand a fault of 'Abenomics' and we need to think how to develop the economy in japan."
1275,"I found it so difficult to understand what this article said. I don't agree with 'Abenomics'. This policy looks like the biggest gamble of Japan, in my opinion. This policy is carried out by Shinzo Abe in order to climb out of its deflation. The important part of this policy is Trans-Pacific Partnership 'TPP'. As he announced that Japan virtually took part in TPP, all goods became a target of negotiation. In short, it depends on negotiation whether TPP will power its economy or not. In fact, this policy is leading Japan in good direction so far, but there is no guarantee that things will go as planned. If this policy turns out to be a failure, this policy will cause stagflation which is called the worst economy. So we should think about this policy carefully."
1276,"I think 'Abenomics' to be effective. When 'Abenomics' fails, economy is confused, but the economy declines when we do not take action.Japan becomes surely like Greece if we do nothing.Unlike conventional three years, I thank for having taken action.Strong stimulation is necessary for the present economy of Japan."
1277,"This writer of this article casts doubt on 'Abenomics'. However, I do not think Abenomics have negative affects on our daily life. Since rising commodity prices means wage increase, and furthermore, low yen is good for export. As you know, we have little resources in Japan so we have to get foreign currency by exporting. All Abe doing things make Japanese economy pick up, I'm sure."
1278,"I am not familiar with economy.But when I hear the news,I think there is a gap between the government of Japan and the Japanese people.In other words,wealth people and people who make money on the stock market can really feel the effect of 'Abenomics' ,however,average people can't only feel it,but also their lives are being more and more hard.In the past,Japan went through the collapse of the bubble economy.So I think that the consumption will decrease rather than rise contrary to the rise in prices for fear of the second collapse of Japanese economy .Certainly we should evaluate the action present government have done and practicing their policy,but I think the government should formulate a policy directly connected with the life of average people."
1279,"Abenomics is too much a narrow-minded policy,I think.It's true that if you ease money, the money circulate more faster and the economy gets active.But that's only a theory.Abenomics relies too much on theory.It doesn't focus on the sight of individuals,from average to poor people.Thus,I think this policy won't last long."
1280,"I have a doubt for 'Abenomics'. Because it is groundless, and the rise in prices has not been accompanied with the rise in wage . Actually, there are a few people who answer that he or she receive a higher salary than he or she used to and economy is good now in a man-in-the-street interview . However,I think it is sure that many people are looking for the economy to make a recovery. So,I desire that good economy cycle is born and other countries whom economy influence Japanese economy become good, too."
1281,"Before reading this article, I knew the word 'Abenomics.' The bold financial policy is thought as important. It is because there is a view of becoming an explosive of buoying up the economy if thorough money market relaxation is advanced. I think that this policy does not continue for a long time.Conversely, if there is a danger of causing the stagflation which is in the worst situation, I regard."
1282,"When I read this article, I was very surprised because the price of many things were increased. I didn't notice it. However, I don't think that 'Abenomics' is just a bubble. There are some reasons. First, salaries is rising. For example, spring labor offensive in this year was succeeded. A lot of companies rise salaries. Second, consumption is increasing. Many consumers buy expensive things for midyear gifts in this year. Finally, Japanese weekly magazines are mostly rubbish. Shukan Post is not exception, either. They only write gossip and lies. So I cannot trust this article because of quotation from Shukan Post."
1283,"I thought 'Abenomics' to be good until I read this article. However, I know an particular person may profit by it and can't have a good feeling. If a salary does not go up and the consumption tax rises, a citizen will be angry with him and his policy. The government should consider our future economy again."
1284,"Abenomics goes well in theory but for the average citizen,it can be hardship. In my opinion, it's not a good policy that is dependent of only a theory. The good one is the plan that fully takes account of us,the average citizen. I think this policy will fall down before long."
1285,"Next April , the consumption tax will rise to 8% from 5%. Only this situation , our lives will somewhat be hard. And the effect of 'Abenomics' is concerned. But I do not think 'Abenomics' affects worse our lives. Because we should evaluate it for a more longer time. And I think policy about economy , politics and so on can not be evaluated over a short span exactly."
1286,"On 5.23, we had the stock market crash. Weather this happening is the fault of Abenomics is indistinct, but it surely damaged to the market. Today, the stock prices is not stable. Then, why this stock market crash happened? One of the optimistic ideas is that it was just an adjustment term. Until then, the stock prices sharply jumped, so investors sold their stocks to adjust the market. However, as a negative idea, the stock market crash meant the limit of Abenomics. Abenomics only aroused our customer interests, and it was not the structural reform. Therefore, it was bubble, and the stock market crash was the bursting of bubble and inevitable. To judge which idea is right, we should pay much attention to the economy."
1287,"I think people should wait to complain about 'Abenomics' at the moment. That is because we haven't really got to see how 'Abenomics' will impact on Japanese society yet. It is true that the rises in prices of everything has been forcing hardships to people in every social rank. However, it is also true that an economic boom should be caused by inflation too. So it is possible that an economy continues to improve by sustaining 'Abenomics' and people can easily buy expensive things. We should wait to see how the Japanese society will change from now on, and then criticize it."
1288,"I think 'Abenomics' may be good to our society in the future. Now, the prices of everything from utilities to toilet paper, food to furniture, has already begun and will accelerate. The prices of everything is rising but not salaries. But the salary will rise, too. Then, 'Abenomics' will be a good policy to us."
1289,"I can't judge 'Abenomics' produces a revival or a bubble because I am not an expert of economy but a general person. Recently news frequently reports that business has been recovering, but I feel these kinds of news don't have a clear basis or proof. Of course, it is the fact that the Japanese nation uses more money to anything. On the other side, it is also the fact that salaries hasn't risen at all. Therefore we feel distressed by higher prices rather than enjoy good time of business. In addition, I claim that the low yen is not always admirable. This is because Japan cannot work out without importing many sorts of stuffs. So, it is the most important for Japan to keep the best balance of the yen value."
1290,"I think that 'Abenomics' is a makeshift. If the government help the economic, the Japanese economy can't recover. Because power of the Japanese economy is weak. The Japanese government should have different aim. It is no meaning that only economic development. We need that think about ourself happiness."
1291,"Abenomics made some motion of Japan's economy. Yen moved to cheap and stock price rose up. The time of the first, media reports recovery in the economy, and revival of bonus in large companies. Everybody of course me too, thought Japan's future is bright. But eventually, media started to tell us about inflation of prices, oil, gas, flour and bread. They reported that salary is not rising in almost companies. by the way, I want to buy Macbook, but it gone up about 10,000 yen by weak yen. I couldn't comply, I realized rising price. But I don't curse Mr. Abe, I think he does good job. Politicians until now doesn't move to rebuild Japan's economy. On the other hand Mr. Abe put into practice. I think even if something doesn't good work, it's important whether to challenge, not just say."
1292,"When I read this article, I thought that the Japanese should know and be more interested in the information of the politics and the economy. Because most of the Japanese know the word of 'Abenomics' but don't understand the meaning of this word. I can not have the actual feeling of this effects so I want this policy to success and lead the Japanese future bright."
1293,"I don't know what is the best way for Japan. 'Abenomics' is the best way ? Maybe yes, but maybe not. The price of every things rises, this situation is not so much matter for rich person, but a lot of general person should upset.. This is rapid and drastic changes of economic structures. I hope this policy affects us better. We should continue to think about this problem carefully."
1294,"When I read this article, I was very shock. I was not too interested in 'Abenomics' so far, but I believed that there is no demerit in the policy. However, a demerit written by an article occurred by Abenomics'. I didn't know these facts at all. I reflected on not having been interested in politics so far. After all, it is bad not to know own country's detail. I want to study hard about this problem"
1295,"I thought Abenomics is good policy for us, but actually I can't judge whether this policy is good. Abenomics has many sides. The price is rising, but Japanese economy is getting better.People should judge this policy carefully. However, it is clear that no action can produce no good results."
1296,"Abenomics is very good opinion. Because, as a result, an economic recover. But I don't know anything.This policy is very difficult, so I can't understand. Japan will be better than any other country, and people will get a lot of wages. I want to be good by I graduate from KEIO!"
1297,"I think that 'Abenomics' is a good plan. 'Abenomics' revived the economy of Japan which had hung low. I think that economy will get confused if 'Abenomics' breaks. In order that a country may make 'Abenomics' successful, I want it to be consistent. I am opposed to a rise of a consumption tax. I think that people's consumption will decrease."
1298,"I think Abenomics is a bubble, as Shukan Post viewed. Of course it helps Japanese economy recover, but it is not sure that the effect will last for several years. This policy's purpose is to increase the amount of money on the market. However putting too much money at the same time may confuse the situation. Also Mr. Abe carries out deregulation and issues government bonds to activate the market, but it means that the amount of debt which we, young generation, have to pay off is increasing and our burden gets heavier and heavier. I understand that recovering from recession is very important, but the policy should be more sustainable."
1299,"I also regard a Abenomics as uneasy. Business has been improving recently. However, I think that it resembles the bubble economy. But, we only have believing the Prime Minister's thing. It is hoped, as it is, business of Japan continues improving. After business improves, it is expected that the wonderful life will wait."
1300,"It is fact that rising prices of goods hit our family budgets.From the this point, we will feel being poor. But ,from the view of social security, if, by the whole of the society being better, government can do a better policy, we may be get real chance of being well. Government naturally have duty of persuade people. But we also have duty of believe our leader."
1301,"I was really shocked about this news. This is because, I thought Abenomics has just good influence for Japanese economic. But after I read this news I realized it has not good affect like a weak yen. We already get some bad influence. Also the news which I saw in this morning said, people who recommend Abenomics are less than people who are not recommend. It means many Japanese people are afraid of Japanese new economic style and not really recommend. So that we need to know both of good and bad effect of Abenomics."
1302,"I often watch the word 'Abenomics' in newspaper and news program ,but I couldn't explain the meaning of this word or get straight to the point. Economics is difficult to be predicted.If the Japanese economy is on track for recovery,it will not be able to guarantee to keep a good condition after several years,too. Therefore, I think 'Abenomics' is not said to be effective easily. Also this article makes reference to the word of stagflation. The meaning of this word is prices have gone up in spite of salaries of people can't be raised or the number of unemployed people rises in depression. If 'Abenomics will lead to stagflation,we will not get out 'Lost a score of years'. So that we have awareness of the issues of Japanese economy and check the movement in the government, may cause economic stability. I think we are only attracted to the charms of the word of 'Abenomics' and believe to recover Japanese economy is danger."
1303,"After I red this article, I notice the influence of ' Abenomics' which I have not been interested. A strong yen rate may have good influence for exporting, but it will threaten our daily. In fact price for example McDonald's raises prices not only hamburger because I guess most of material of hamburger are imported from foreign countries. It is very small influence for rich people, but one for the middle class like us are so serious. The price increase makes our life needy and our demand is decrease. As a result it makes a recession. Of course I know the higher price are good for business conditions in theory. In fact exporting are better than ever and company's profits are increase. But salary are not increase, so 'Abenomics' make a difference between rich people and poor people broader. I think 'Abenomics' are not bad for economy. but it will not success without increasing salary."
1304,"Actually,I'm not understand about Abenomics well and economy well.But I think that a economic policy is have to reduce to every citizen,not a part of people. Now it maybe in the early stage of revival.We cannot hurry,and should to observe the circumstances."
1305,"Rising price is necessary for economic recovery.Actually,this phenomenon can be seen now and it was a part of 'Abenomics' from a beginning.However,this policy has many risks.It needs the corporation of the nation.Without persuasive explanation,people can't understand policy correctly and government can't carry out the plan.If the prices continue rising and salaries don't be raised,people won't buy things.The government should encourage people to buy for economic recovery."
1306,"I was surprised when I read this article because I thought Abenomics had very good effects to Japanese economics. But,it was not correct. Judging from this news, sudden weak yen or some economic action don't go far below the surface. I think if we improve our economics , we have to change fundamental system"
1307,"What I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that listeners can understand the contents without any efforts. We should not care small grammatical mistakes, but we should explain general points of the contents to the listeners. To do so, we have to speak slowly and clearly and speak with loud voice,of course in easy English. Also, eye contacts must be done in order to impress the listeners. And I thought it is interesting to offer quizzes or movies or pictures in presentations in order not to bore listeners."
1308,"Before I read this article, I got a positive impression because it can help our lives better. I heard that economy was restored in news recently. However, according to this news, I thought this economic recovery to have possibilities to be only a temporary thing. After Next April the consumption tax is due to rise to 8% from 5%, I am afraid whether economy in Japan does not go to the bad direction."
1309,"Doing presentation in Japanese is difficult for me. Of course, doing presentation in English was so difficult that I couldn't do that well. To do a good presentation, first, I think the words used in the script should be easy to understand. My script contained some difficult words and phrases. Such words or phrases bother the listeners.Second, presenter should make good eye contact. Only reading the script makes the listener bored. Third, good slides and clear main point are needed. Good slides attract the interest of listener and clear main point help understand the news. Next time, I want to do presentation better."
1310,"I think eye contact and clear voice is important for doing good presentation. It is because eye contact is needed to see whether people understand or not.And,I can make themselves understood by clear voice.What is more,good slide is also needed to help people understand.That is all."
1311,"I learned two things for doing a good presentation in English through the last class. First, I learned that memorizing the manuscript is important to make a speech without any trouble at all. In fact, the speech of Akiya and Mayu, who memorized their own manuscript were easy to hear. Second, I find the influence of the figures and the pictures. No matter how we make a good manuscript, the words lose the figures and the pictures in the impact. Expressing the main points in figures or pictures is important for a good presentation."
1312,"Important things of doing presentation is careful preparation and playing it by ear. If prepare carefully the presentation, we can doing presentation to relax. Besides if see audience, one can play it by ear in the presentation, the presentation become perfect. Preparation of my presentation in the last class was not perfect. So, I got into a panic. But I could play it by ear, finally Mr. Marchand smiled."
1313,"What I think the important for doing a good presentation in English is doing eye contact with listeners regularly. I think that we have good communication by doing eye contact. And, by doing so, a presenter see whether listeners can understand or not. I think that eye contact is the most important for doing a good presentation in English."
1314,"Indeed, the World Cup should bring development and money. But it is the benefit of the future people. It cannot be helped that Hundreds of thousands of people rallied as a protest movement because their money levied will return not them but the prosperity of Brazil. I think that the World Cup should bring also energy to a people. In 2011, the terrible earthquake struck Japan, especially Tohoku district. Being influenced by the disaster, Japanese people seem to be less energetic in these days. Japan, the country which seeks vitality, is just the right country for staging the World Cup."
1315,"I learned that a presenter need lead and help a listener join the presentation and I think the following two ways are important to make a good presentation. The first way is asking questions during the presentation. This way is very good because both a presenter and listeners join and make a presentation together. All the students I listened to did ask some questions to draw out my reaction. Thanks to them, I enjoyed the news stories without feeling bored. Asking questions makes listeners think about the topic more deeply and react to the presentation. The second way is eye contact. At first, I was too nervous to look at my listener, but it seemed to make her a little uneasy. Then I tried to make eye contact to see her reaction. As a result, she appeared to be relieved and understood the contents better. Moreover, I got comfortable to speak to her. I realized that making eye contact is very important for both a presenter and listeners."
1316,"Of course, I think it is good to stage the World Cup in Brazil, but the government should make sure that socially disadvantaged people can lead lives where they do not cause such demonstrations. I think that big inequality of wealth among people in Brazil is the main cause of this accidents. If poor people are benefited enough economically, they would be able to stand even when government raise taxes. Anyway I think that social security is important issue in every country to solve problems like this accident."
1317,"If we want to teach something by presentation, we have to use easy words and speak slowly and clearly. When I watched TED, nobody speak while looking their script. They are not just say something, they tell and listen audience's reaction, sometimes they ask a question to the listener. They communicate with audience. In contrast, sometimes I read my script, and spoke unclearly. I just spoke one-slide-ly, so I can't tell all of things that I want to convey. I think communicating with audience is important for doing presentation in English."
1318,"I think it important to speak with the enthusiasm that I want to convey. I cannot speak English well. But when I do my presentation, I try to speak more clearly, loudly and slowly. Because I want to convey information in my presentation. And I think the enthusiasm reaches audiences. So we should have the enthusiasm that I want to convey when we do a presentation."
1319,"My opinion is that there are 2 big points for doing a good presentation in English, which are thinking about listener and making a good Power Point. First, we need to think about listener because the purpose of presentation is to have listener understand what we want tell them. For example, to make a presentation understandable, we should look at listener expressively, speak with clear voice, and using easy English. The second, we need to making a good Power Point. It's maybe kind of thinking about listener, but let's think about this as a different point because it is a big detail. PowerPoint should be attractive to get attention. So, in order to that, it would be better to keep in mind that we should use few keywords, use many pictures, and write notes if there are some difficult vocabulary. Thus it is important to think about listeners and make a Power Point for doing a good presentation in English."
1320,"I think what doing nice presentation need are eye-contact, clear voice and well-organized slides. First, we should take eye-contact in presentation, because taking eye-contact make listener more listen and I can grasp degree of understanding of listener. For example, we have to look partner's eye when we talk to someone. Second, we should speak clearly during presentation. If we speak low, listener cannot listen what we said and cannot understand contents of presentation. Finally, we should make well-organized slides used in presentation. We use as little words as possible and several pictures on slides. Such slides make listener understand more. In conclusion, I think taking eye-contact, speaking clearly and organizing slides well are very important for doing presentation."
1321,I think being able to speak what to think is the most important thing. So I should expand my vocabulary and practice to pronunciation.
1322,"I think interesting theme is very important for good presentation.Because,to choose interesting theme is easier than to make progress English skills.So,to choose good theme is easy and important for us.After it, we should practice our English skills."
1323,"The World Cup is very popular event all over the world and this event has many merits for the host country.But these merits must not precede happiness of people.Moreover,many countries want to hold The World Cup. If It is not held in Brazil,it may be able to be held in other country.So,I think governments must protect happiness of people."
1324,"In my opinion, it is the most important to make listeners understand my own presentation, so we have to use simple words as much as possible and speak clearly. Of course we sometimes have to use difficult words according as I choice difficult subject matter, but we make efforts to convert difficult words into simple words flexibly. In order to speak clearly, we have to take a lot of time to practice our speech of presentation and memorize my draft of speech completely. In conclusion, we have to take a lot of time to complete our presentation."
1325,"I think organizing is important.The way of it is different from in Japanese to in English.Introduction have to be attractive and clear conclusion is usually said at first in English presentation. Making eye contact and not looking your notes all the time,speak clearly not swaying back and forth like pendulum,and facial expressions are also important."
1326,"I think that it is the most important to make the main point which oneself wants to tell to a partner clear.This is why the contents become plain naturally because it is decided mainly on the main point by doing so it.In addition, I think that I come to strongly read the part which I want to tell more by being conscious of the main point"
1327,"I think that most important thing of presentation is the motivation to tell. Of cause, eye contacts, presentation and the volume of voice are important. But the motivation moves the listener's hearts and concentrates to listen."
1328,"presentations with fewer explanations are easier to understand, but It's not good to have little detail. Furthermore if it's too long to remember, It will cause that we can't catch listeners' reactions. Therefore, the balance is important. presentations in English are difficult for us to conduct, but much more difficult to understand. Then slides help us understand more, and pictures and figures are more powerful for listeners, so It's better to explain with dynamic slides with a little word. Of course, it's essential to memorize our presentation. If do so, we can speak with accents in important points and It will be better with eye contact."
1329,"I think the most important point in the presentation is 'simple'. It is important to be clear about what you want to convey,and explain it easy to understand. If you talking about too much, it is rather difficult to understand."
1330,I think that it's important for presenter to speak clearly and make sure to tell what you want to tell to the listeners. It is not enough just speaking clearly. You need make sure that listeners understand what you said from their reaction or their faces. I learned this thing from my presentation.
1331,"I believe the most important point is eye contacts and some gestures, not passages we speak or pronunciation of the language. It is proved by the fact that the other day Japanese Tanaka Rie's speech of inviting the Olympics was very highly admired in the world. At the time I feel her English skill itself is not so good, but she smiled and made gestures all the time during the presentation. Maybe those elements are more important when we present to foreign people because they talk with their 'eyes', while Japanese often look at the paper on the desk during other's presentation."
1332,"The World Cup is the most international soccer tournament held every four years. It is good for host country Brazil, because it brings development and money. However, it will cost host country a lot of money to prepare the World Cup. In my opinion, the world Cup should be staged by not only host country's government but also its people,and its government must convince its people to pay the cost of preparing the World Cup.If people in host country Brazil strongly oppose for staging the World Cup, its government have to reconsider the World Cup.Of course the World Cup is important for host country, but host country have to pay attention to points in dispute, such as a hike in public transport fares, more than the World Cup and should make efforts to solve them, preceding all others. I hope that Brazil solve them completely and the World Cup is held in Brazil."
1333,"I felt a little complicated when I read this article.Many people in the world are looking forward to have the world cup.Also many of the soccer fans long to have world cup in their own country.However the news shows that many of the Brazilians are not welcoming the world cup.This is contrary to my expectation.I think that development or a big project which ignores the people can be harmful.Developing countries,including Brazil,should more think about the people's quality of life and don't be attracted to much by the immediate profit."
1334,I think the most important thing is 'simple'. The listener does not read if I write words for the slide too much. The listener will not hear all if I talk too much. Talking and writing have to be minimal. Steve Jobs did only minimum explanation as an expert of the presentation. And also important thing is 'voice'. We should speak loudly in a clear voice.
1335,"In my opinion,what is most important for a good presentation is giving your listeners eye contacts because they attract their attention and make you look confident. These two things is needed when you do a presentation. And I think speaking fluently is also needed because clear words make it easier to understand the contents than unclear ones."
1336,"I think the most important thing when we do presentation is to try to make eye-contact with listeners.Doing so,we can see their reaction,in other words,we can grasp whether they understand the topic of our presentation or not.If we do so,we can put the phrase they don't understand in simpler terms on the spot.But for doing so,we should prepare minutely and practice so hard.So we have to understand the details and main points in order to enable them to understand more easily."
1337,"I felt how people dissatisfied with the government. According to this article, people have made a protest because of the bad quality of public services and the high cost of staging the World Cup. To tell the truth, I could understand about the bad quality of public services, but I have never thought the high cost of staging the World Cup would be a cause of the protest because I thought Brazil was famous for soccer. So, I was surprised when I knew the governments in Brazil actually have just wasted money for the World Cup. Of course, I like the World Cup, but I don't want Brazil to be in a financial crisis. So, I hope the Brazilian government will solve this problem soon."
1338,"The most important thing for doing a good presentation in English, I think, is explaining details simply. It is because it is always more difficult to listen to explanations than to read the passages. Especially when you give a presentation to non-native English speakers, you should try to use easy that everyone can understand. Last week, one of the students whom I sat by the same table with kept talking really fast in vague voice, though the classroom was very noisy. However, the next boy explained details in easy English, and I could know the main points precisely just by listening to his presentation and looking at slides."
1339,"I was surprised at protest demonstrations in Brazil when I was pleased and sad in what Samurai blue's game. I look forward to the World Cup. So I want Brazil to hold it. However, if it causes economic conditions of the nation, I cannot become selfish. Brazil will be able to get profit by World Cup. I think the government should show the outgoing and incoming expectation to the nation."
1340,I think is most important for doing presentations in English is that thinking what is importance for listeners. It is not until there are listeners that presentations are consisted. So speakers should think what is importance for listeners and tell its importance specifically. Therefore speakers have to devise vocabularies and expressions. They are not objects that itself expressing formal and simple.
1341,"First, I think we should research deeply, and we have to answer questions if I am questioned anything. If I can't answer the question, Listener will think I don't understand the contents. Second, we should be a good speaker of English. If I can't speak English very well, people have to concentrate to listen my English, so they will not understand the contents deeply. Finally, we should see the eyes of listener. It means that I talk them, so they can feel relieved."
1342,"I think it is important to explain slowly and to take eye contact in order to know whether a listener is understood or not. And, I feel that it helps understand to repeat an important point . If there are many words to hear for the first time , so explaining a term first is good way to help listener's understanding. Not to mention, it is important understanding contents well and talking by good pronunciation in a loud voice. However, I feel it is important to explain slowly carefully particularly when we give presentation in English ."
1343,"I think the most important thing is eye contact in presentation. Communication makes our presentations clear. Without eye contact, our presentation would be boring. It is too difficult to use perfect English,but we should try to use English. Active motivation makes our presentations well-organized."
1344,"I think that speaking loudly and making eye contact are very important things for doing a good presentation in English. The most important purpose of presentations is communicating information to others. Without loud speaking and eye contact, you cannot communicate any information to them. However, most Japanese, including me, cannot do them well. So I need to get accustomed doing them."
1345,"The most important thing when we make a presentation is 'passion' I thought. Needless to say English skill or eye contact are also necessary skills, but 'passion' engages listener's attention more easily I think. So we should research a topic more carefully and make a presentation passionately."
1346,"To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. No matter how attractive the slides are, no matter how fluent I speak English, difficult story is difficult to understand itself. Well-ordered slides are also important to make a better presentation. It is not good to write too many words in a slide, but it is not good to write few words. Next time, I want to make a good presentation, keeping these points in mind."
1347,"After doing my presentation, I had a feeling that it was difficult to tell what I want to say. To do so, you have to speak easy English, face to the listener, have many pictures, and make contents brief and easy to understand. Especially, you have to put yourself in the listener's shoes. I think this is most important for good presentations."
1348,"I think that confidence is the most important at a presentation. It is because I can talk clearly if I have confidence. Moreover, it can talk and looking at a partner. If it practices so that I have confidence, I will regard a presentation as being memorized. I think that Making it grand with confidence considered."
1349,"Even though the economy tend to good direction, I can't call it succeed unless we feel ourselves wealthy. Off course, the increasing prices and taxes may revitalize the economy. But if our income doesn't increase, we only suffer from the rising. So I think president Abe should take action to better income for workers before raising prizes. However, I feel he want to regain the wealth of bubble generation. As for me and the generation which doesn't know the bubble, it is so interesting revolution. So I don't want him to give up."
1350,"I learned that it is difficult to make my speech without looking at the paper written what to say. But if I try to emphasize or make some gestures when I speak what I want to tell, it will become better presentation. In the last presentation's case, everyone made their speeches at the same time. It might made me forced to speak aloud from start to end. So next time, I want to challenge to make my speech in the silence situation."
1351,"I love the World Cup because it is the hottest event in the world and very exciting.So I was very surprised at the protests.I understood the problems in Brazil.However,I think the World Cup is necessary for people all over the world,also for people in Brazil.It is because it is very popular and bring good influence to the Brazilian economy.So I expect Brazil will have a good economic policy and it will be successful."
1352,"It will be difficult problem to hold World Cup or take precedence over economic policy. But it is true that poverty breaks people's heart. So I think the government should listen to what the demonstrators say. Holding World Cup should be after the solution of the trouble. As for me, I can't enjoy soccer game in the situation. So even if the World Cup make the government wealthy, they shouldn't take action under the trouble."
1353,"I think that important points are eye contact and clear pronunciation in a presentation. Eye contact is the foundations of a presentation. I think that the eye contact can convey a feeling. I think that clear pronunciation is required in order to give information correctly. Unless the right information is transmitted, there is no meaning of a presentation. I think that people's attitude to hear is also important. A presenter's motivation will also be lost if an attitude is bad."
1354,"I was shocked very much that the percentage of children aged between 0 and 14 years old in Japan is the lowest in the world and less than half the global average of 26.8%.It is a very serious problem.Of course,I understand people who complain about noises,but children's noise is unavoidable.I expect all the people in Japan grasp the seriousness of the declining birthrate in Japan and accept children's noises."
1355,"I think it good for Brazil to hold World Cup. Soccer is a national sport for Brazil. Much money may be applied to holding. However, I think that there is an economic effect of an absurd big frame if Brazil wins the victory in the World Cup. If Brazil misses a championship, Brazil will go into the red. Probably, many people have a question in having held the convention. Great expectation will start the representative of Brazil for soccer. But I think that there is power which meets the expectation in Neymar."
1356,"World cup is really famous soccer invent, and there are many fans all over the world. I also like watching soccer game, so this news was shocked for me. Government should care about their citizens first of all."
1357,"I think the most important thing for presentation is to speak clearly.When I listen to other's presentation, I sometimes can't listen the main point.It's because the voice is unclear.The purpose of presentation is inform listeners of information.Speaker should be conscious of speaking clearly and slowly."
1358,"The most important thing in a presentation is using easy words, I think. We cannot understand difficult English, so using easy words are required. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more conscience next time. Speaking in a loud voice is also very important. If presentation speak in a small voice, we cannot understand what he or she is saying. I have to practice more for the next presentation."
1359,"After I red this article, I was so interested in it because I belonged to soccer club, so I like soccer very well. But I think it is interested in not only me but also many Japanese. Recently, Japan soccer team has became stronger and most Japanese must expect the next World Cup. But I think The World Cup can be held in wherever. Brazil is strong in soccer, but citizens are against for holding The World Cup. I wonder how The Government suppresses this protest movement and if it's possible to success The World Cup."
1360,"I think it is important for good presentation to guess if listeners can understand means of presentation. Of course, it's important to make a presentation which is easy to be understood, but to guess listeners' ideas are more important. But if we are crazy only to do presentations, we can't look at listeners and judge listeners' ideas. So we must look at listeners and we should make communications with listeners as possible as we can. So I can't look at the manuscripts and do presentation like speaking."
1361,People from all over the world loves World Cup. I think hosting World Cup make people exciting and make the country wealthy. So I think it is good for Brazil to host World Cup. But it is clear that people in Brazil are dissatisfied with their government now. The government should listen to the people and solve a problem before they host a World Cup.
1362,I think attitude
1363,"I think the attitude to convey our message to a listener is important for doing a good presentation.If we try to persuade a partner,we will prepare for a presentation before. Firstly,we should understand our news completely and memorize.Then,we need check that there is no words we don't know and whether we explain difficult words. Secondly,when we do a presentation,it is important that we speak clearly and look listener´s eyes.Listeners try listening carefully if we do that. In conclusion,if we have a mind try to do a good presentation,we can do it."
1364,"Next year , World Cup will be hold in Brazil. Brazil is the country that the gap between the rich and poor is intense. If supporters from many countries come Brazil , they spend the money only safety area : the area the rich lives. So , the poor remains to be poor. I think that's why the protest happened."
1365,"I am surprised with the size of the protest is large, To Judging from the size of a large protest, politics of Brazil does not seem well. I do not know much information about Brazil, so I do not know which is the cause of the demonstration; the intention of the government doesn't become widely known to the public, or the government is corrupt. However, the ability of the government's shortage is clear. Also, I'm worried about whether urban functions are working. If Demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function. I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
1366,"I am surprised with the size of the protest is large, To Judging from the size of a large protest, politics of Brazil does not seem well. I do not know much information about Brazil, so I do not know which is the cause of the demonstration; the intention of the government doesn't become widely known to the public, or the government is corrupt. However, the lack of the ability of the government is clear. Also, I'm worried about whether urban functions are working. If demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function. I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
1367,"Now,Tokyo is working hard to get the right to be able to be held the Olympic Games. The people of Tokyo feel the complicated feelings. Generally, the city can invite the Olympic Games will grow the economy and industry. But like this article, the government should understand what the people really need."
1368,"sorry, I missed World Cup and Olympic."
1369,"Of course , I want Brazil to hold World Cup but I also think this country should consider medical care and education of the children. If this protest will going on , World Cup of Brazil may be canceled. I think it is very sorry. This World Cup may be a start of an economic growth. I hope World Cup of Brazil is held !!!"
1370,"Holding World Cup promotes the economic growth. Not only World Cup, but also Olympic in 2016 is to be held in Brazil. These events cost a lot to be held, but the benefits are much bigger. For example, Tokyo Olympic in 1964 promoted Japanese economic growth and thanks to that a transportation network spread. The government of Brazil and the people should cooperate and make Brazil a better country."
1371,"I had thought that Brazilian were so pleased to stage World Cup in Brazil where is soccer kingdom. Therefore, I was surprised at protest demonstrations in Brazil when I hear this news. I think that other countries should spend money to Brazil to help staging World Cup in soccer kingdom."
1372,"When I heard the news,I thought I had not been very interested in demonstrations I unusually saw on the street.Having heard a major victory of Brazilian people,I learned the importance of demonstrations insisting our thoughts and ideas.As they caught the victory,the power of nations sometimes actually change the plan or the idea of the goverment.So I realized that it is very,very important to insist our idea raising our voice.I think it can be said in other various situation and to various problems.So I would like to insist my thoughts positively."
1373,"I was surprised to hear that there is a protest marching against World Cup, as I thought it always brings positive outcomes especially in economics. I knew that corruption is one of the most serious issues in Latin-American countries, but I have nothing to say for that. My knowledge of politics is poor and the problem does not seem relative to my daily life."
1374,"The most important things to give a good presentation are: speaking clearly, making eye-contacts, catching the audiences' interest. I think those 3 things are the key."
1375,I think hosting World Cup is good for Brazil. It makes Brazil affluent. Many people in Brazil can enjoy watching games. Therefore I was surprised to read this news. I think the government of Brazil should consider Brazilians. All people in Brazil should live happily.
1376,"I understand the demonstrator's feelings. Although I do not really know how the Brazilian government is irresponsible for economic policies, I can still see that people are angry at the act of the today's government. By reading this article, it seems that people and the government have not discussed Brazil's future course. Without reflecting public opinion, the government has been trying to stage the World Cup aggressively, so people have not agreed with it. People may not want to waste their money, if they cannot be convinced that the World Cup will bring development and money. Considering that fact, I think they should talk over their issues more each other. It is the government role that it explains concretely how the society will improve if it invest in the World Cup until people understand. Also it is important for the government to clarify the reason why the economy remains stagnant and how it thinks to recover. If they do these things carefully, the demonstration could be moderated."
1377,"I think Brazil protests should be continued.Of course,people who protest should not use violence to make government change their plan.However,whether people do whatever actions,government can not change their plans in related to world cup program.People have no choice but use power.So they continued protests."
1378,"The demonstrate in Brazil this time was very significant. Because the Confederations Cup and the World Cup are in the spotlight. If the Olympic take place in Japan, demonstrate would happen? Recently we could see demonstrate to nuclear power plant. I think there are happen that big demonstrate to politics. It is problem that demonstrate doesn't happen rather happen. Japanese have to say our opinion."
1379,"I was so surprised, when I saw this news.Because I didn't know Brazil has many serious problem. in my imagination, Brazil's economic is growing and Brazilian's life becomes rich so they are happy. But in fact Brazilian's life is severe enough to gather 800,000 people to do demonstration. If this protest activity aim to tell to the world about this issue, it works. Many people in the world saw this news and leaned Brazil have many problem. And I think Brazilian should continue protesting, by doing so, their life will be better, but I think they have to do demonstration with no violence, no riot, no looting, and no bloodshed. At last I hope their life will be good and will held wonderful and happy World cup and Olympic."
1380,"Generally speaking, that staging the World Cup bring a huge sum of positive economic effect for the host country. Of course,Brazil is the host country of the World Cup in 2014 will receive this benefit.One of examinations says Brazil will receive 142,000,000 real as economic effect and create employment of 3,000,000 people. Although, the protesters raise their voice about expenses for World Cup,corruption, poor public service and so on. Brazil is a rising country developed rapidly,while it has various problems still.I think if Government hope for developing and getting ripe country,it should listen to the people's voice.Brazil will not probably join developed countries without satisfying the people.So I think,Government has to make a social system the people accepted before the World Cup and Olympic."
1381,"I think that protesters don't protest to staging the Confederations Cup and the World Cup but to cost of staging. I know Brazilian like soccer, so everyone may think hosting the Cups is good to Brazil. But they don't like the government waste too much money. Brazilian Government should understand their feelings, save the money and stage the Cups in peace."
1382,"I cannot decide which side(admiration of Snowden or rebuke of Snowden)I am willing to agree. Both sides have their own reasons for their claims. This news made me think about the question,'Is it allowable to force people to be victims for the interests of the countries?'Of course it is important to defend interests of countries,but I thought fundamental human rights should not be dismissed because these rights must be the important elements of democratic countries. Especially,privacy rights are significant in this information age."
1383,"In Japan, the government often doesn't make policies that reflect public opinions even though people protest in a proper way. For example, when they protested against construction of dams, American army bases, or re-operation of nuclear power plants, they could not draw out any concrete measure from the government. For this reason, I was very surprised at the success of the demonstration in Brazil. The will of the people affected the authorities!! Even though there may be some people who have not been satisfied with the result, it is great that they raised a cry of protest and overturned the government's decision. I think staging Confederations Cup and World Cup itself has a good effect on economy, but Brazil government should open the information to satisfy its people and carry out the policies showing the sincerity."
1384,I was surprised at the news and I felt that the protest movement was dangerous. I did not know Brazil protests until I read this article. I think that mounting public resentment caused this protest movement. I also think that the government should be fully aware of the minds of a nation.
1385,"I think the second example is the best way to learn new languages and new words.You pick up the sentences including unknown words and expressions in notebook and read them again and again,then you can not only remember the meanings of the words but learn how to use them.This way of studying will also helps you to understand new languages as they are,with no work of translation."
1386,"I'm very proud of him as a Japanese.He is incredible indeed,but not for his feat of breaking the record.He is not very young but challenging his limit.I'm a 18 year-old boy and I know I'm young enough to achieve something,but I was scared of running the risks.I have to learn something important from his great effort and achievement."
1387,"I would say that Snowden is both a hero and a traitor. Snowden may have broken the law, but it is obvious that national invasion of US citizens' privacy has much more to be impeached. This news reminded me of the last stage of nations such as USSR. Though Snowden is a traitor for the people who make a profit by secretly collected data, he is a hero for most of US citizens."
1388,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research.If we believe it,the nation can not exist in the first place.So, we should approve that research is for the society.But,invasion of privacy by malice government may exist.Then,we must support the whistleblower if he arrests. But,we do not need to support a traitor as if a hero."
1389,"I think it good to hold the World Cup in Brazil. Because a possibility of Brazil that immense economical profits can be obtained is high.However, people feel dissatisfaction for using it for World Cup holding of a tax with an immense state. Therefore, people have caused the riot. I think that there is even a possibility that such a riot will have a bad influence on the world economy."
1390,"I was very surprised because I think that Brazil is a peaceful country.It is true that there are a lot of crimes in Brazil. However, Brazil is not a country that there are many riots in the country. Its system is democracy. And Brazilian economy is growing rapidly. So I couldn't expect the riot. the riot might be caused because people couldn't keep up with great changes in this country."
1391,"I think this protest is not good for everyone living in Brazil. Even though there is people who don't want WC to be held,protesting now is too late. And it is better for them to make efforts to make WC successful."
1392,"I couldn't understand this news at first.The Brazilian people were pleased that Brazil was chosen as the site of World Cap.However, the people insist that they do not hold it now. Why the people don't want to hold World Cap? Answer is 'no money'. But I think that profit is over the World Cup.Furthermore, it is necessary to heap up it so that profit appears. I think that people should find former big profit than a short-term loss for two years or three years."
1393,"I think a demonstration is one of the effective means that people appeal to the government.If their opinions are difficult to be accepted,the demonstration itself is worth doing. The government can know people's thoughts directory and have a opportunity to think again about the problem. It is important for people that they protest against public problems. They can share complains with other people who gave up improving the situation once and encourage them to protest.And by becoming the the topic,the demonstration will spread and inform many people of the present issue. I think there are few demonstrations in Japan.If Japanese people express their opinions together,young people will also have more interests in politics and the situation will have taken a turn for the better than now."
1394,"I like watching soccer game, and playing soccer. So I am looking forward to seeing World Cup! But, in Brazil, people demonstrated. It is very dangerous for the player, if World Cup is held. If demo continue, World Cup should not be held in Brazil."
1395,"Wherever the country invites the Olympics, they always meet more or less with residents' complaint because of such examples in Brazil. Although the government has serious problems about the way to use money, they don't have to give up holding the Olympics and World Cup. This is because the two are the biggest sports events in the world and they will bring good economy. I believe that they finally will give Brazil numerous amount of money that might solve the protest movement over the quality of public services as a result. Of course, I can understand the validity of people's protest but they should be satisfied with the Games."
1396,"Before I read this news,I thought Confederations Cup and the World Cup are welcomed favorably. I never thought about such protests movement when I enjoyed watching the soccer game on TV. I agree the 28-year-old medical student in this article because the good economic impact are expected by hosting these events. I think it makes people happy and give positive energy to hold world-wide championships. Actually, I'm so excited because Tokyo invites Olympics now. Of course,I also think that the government have to be take countermeasures in order not to waste money."
1397,"I think 2 things are the most important things to give a good presentation. First thing is 'attitude'. For example , trying not to see a memo , to tell simply enough to be understood by listener. Second is 'contents' . However simple we give a presentation , it does not make sense if listener cannot understand the contents. So , contents are also important."
1398,"Because I thought that soccer is the most popular in Brazil, I was surprised when I heard this news. But I have come to the conclusion that Brazilian is also looking forward to WC in Brazil, however the situation of their life is bad, so they were not able to miss this perfect opportunity to attract attention from the world.I think this demonstration is the effective means that people appeal to the government. I hope that the quality of their life will improve and WC will held on peacefully!!"
1399,"I also think staging the Cups is good for Brazil. It bring not only money but also popularity. In Japan,some people also say that 'Tokyo Olympic' wastes money.But there are no corruption,this is not true. I hope government should correct the corruption."
1400,"I think protest movement is good because it signify people are interested in politics. Big protest movement don't happen in Japan. Because Japanese politic is stable comparing with foreign countries. But,another reason,Japanese aren't interested in politics comparing with foreign countries."
1401,"When I read this article, I think Edward Snowden has two sides of hero and traitor. Surely, though he believe what he did is right, it is against the low so his action is classified in bad things. But it is sure that there are the rights by his action. Whether he is hero or not is affected by what we think most important."
1402,"I think it's high time that Brazil stops the corruption. People there have got the chance to realize that because the government is sensitive to their big movement,for the World Cup will be held there and people around the world pay attention to it,thinking of the security."
1403,"To be frank, I felt that it is great that Edward acted even risked his position for a first impression. Although,I do not mean his actions are correct in all points . I think that if to divulge confidential benefit the public, his behavior may be correct for the most party. However, there is a risk confusing , he has to be careful if divulge confidential. In summary, the public's right to know and to defend the law, which should also be respected. So, this problem is difficult."
1404,"Many countries think that they invite World Cup to be important, because it makes big profit. However I object to it. It will surely have many merits to hold such a big meeting at own country, but, at the same time it is a fact that various problems such as the aggravation of the peace and order occur. Particularly, they should still less do it when the nation objects like Brazil of this article. When a nation collects large amount of tax and torments people, it becomes illogical. Similarly I think Tokyo shouldn't spend money to stage the Olympics because many of the people are unconcerned about to hold the Olympics in Tokyo. It is useless of a tax. I think that Tokyo should do it more."
1405,"In Japan, sometimes people demonstrate on street, but they seem to make no effect on government's plan.I think it's because of the sizes of demonstrations.Japanese have less consciousness of changing politics ourselves, so the demonstration's scale don't be so big. So the number of people who participated in Brazilian demonstration and its impact on government surprised me. The power of mass ordinary people is actually forcible."
1406,"It agrees, if I am the Brazil people. I am a country and think that it is good to carry out sponsorship of Confederations Cup or the World Cup. A country consumes money by sponsoring. However, a country yields profits. For example, the increase in tourists, etc. That is, I think that it is good to sponsor."
1407,"I think demonstrations are important to make one's country better.I have two reasons for this. First,demonstrations have power to change one's country's policy. For example, in Egypt , many ordinary citizen joined the demonstration,and the political system of a state changed. Second, by joining the demonstration, people will have a good opportunity to criticize their own country objectively. By doing so, a country can be better . So I think demonstration in Brazil is important to make Brazil better."
1408,"Japanese people often demonstrate about governmental policies. Recently, I saw the demonstration about objection to participating in TPP. Foreigners living in Japan also sometimes demonstrate about the governmental attitude to their mother countries. However, I seldom see demonstrations about more political things such as democracy, the Tenno system, government collapses, peace and war. It is said that this is because Japan is already democratic society, so the government fully reflect the will of the people. However, it seems to me that there is another reason. It is the political apathy among the young people. Few decades ago, university students often demonstrated about political things. Today, it is common for the young people not to vote elections. It is not always said that demonstrations can change the country, but it is clear that demonstrations make opportunities to interact the government."
1409,"Demonstrations are not so common in Japan, and I've never thought of doing it. It's because we are happier, but it's possible for me to conduct it in the future, so I should think carefully about it. Money and education are much more important for people than world cup, so it's natural that people in Brazil demonstrated, and I noticed how demonstrations are powerful thanks to it. However, it was better if they had achieved it without violence, so I think we should demonstration with peace way such as demonstration parades and campaign to collect signatures."
1410,"I agree that the situation in Japan prevents the birthrate from rising.Of course,I feel irritated when hearing too noisy yelling of children at night,but in the daylight the noises of children seem quite natural ones.People should be more tolerant indeed.But what should be improved is not only the tolerance of the people.Compared to other countries,such as the U.S,the child care systems seem not very good.We all should become more tolerant,and change the social systems as well."
1411,"I don't know which I should agree.They claimed their opinion based on their justice.But I think when it comes to collision between group force and a person, we should consider about basic human right : privacy right."
1412,I was disappointed to hear this news.I thought that all Brazilian love soccer so they hope to stage World Cup but it's not true.I don't think staging World Cup is 'wasted money'.
1413,"I have never thought about the negative effect of the World Cup. I had expected that every one like sports and it is very good for everyone to hold such big sport tournament in their home countries. So I was very sad to hear this news. Not only the World Cup, but also many factors make this demonstration. It is true that Brazil has a lot of problems to solve, however, I hope that people there can live peaceful."
1414,"This is difficult for me to decide that he is hero or traitor, which side is better? When I read this news, I thought low is really difficult thing. Even if someone does good thing for citizens, it sometimes happens that he is punished, like this news."
1415,"I think some points are important to make good presentation. Above all,The most important point is to think about listeners. We should take care of listeners so that they can understand our presentation better. For example,we should speak with loud voice and we should look at listeners eye."
1416,"It is natural that people claim about government's policy. A nation must compensate people's life,that is the most important thing a nation to do. And I was surprised at police fired tear gas.It means that citizen and government are enemy. Government have to apologize to people and persuade people,"
1417,"I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking U.S. information. However, I think that international society also needs those who do action like him. I want him to escape so that it may not be caught by the United States."
1418,"I want to take a neutral position. What he did was brave, and thank to his action we could know the truth of NSA. He told us only using the Internet is dangerous. On the other hand, what he did was an illegal act. Letting out the secret should be punished. When he was employed, his employer didn't assume such an incident."
1419,"Reading this article,frankly speaking,I would like to praise him.However,I disagree with his Edward Snowden's action.Surely,he did a important leak in American history.But he endangered so many people at the same time.It is to advantage of someone on the one hand,but it is to disadvantage of the other people on the other hand.If his action is admired breaking the low,where is the significance of the low's being?It means everybody can do anything which they regard as right thing.So I think he should have more thought carefully and reconsidered the importance of the low."
1420,"In doing a presentation,I think what is most important is to get the listeners to understand what you want to say.In order to do that,you have to talk to the listeners and look at the listener's eyes,and care if they could understand you.And the speed you talk seems important to make one understand as well.Remembering the details of your speech will also help you to pay more attention to the listeners."
1421,"I do not think Japanese people have less consciousness of changing politics themselves. People in Brazil participate in the demonstration because the government corruption is so bad and people severely wants it to change. Of course, corruption exists in political systems of Japan to some extent, but the government make effort to secure the lives of people as possible. I think people in Japan think they do not have to change government policy."
1422,"I agree with ID1345. I lived near a nursery school, and that school had a sports day. Having a sports day is good, but every year, the sports day was the same weekend when I had tests. The sound from speaker and noise children made irritated me. However, when I was a child, the sound that my school made in a sports day irritated people near the school. I think ID1345's suggestion is effective."
1423,"I disagree with naoemari because she only referred to the parents' responsibility. Of course, discipline is necessary. However, only disciplining prevent children from growing. Instead of accusing parents and children, we should be tolerant."
1424,"I think it quite natural that the people take actions when the authorities go wrong,and they should as positively as possible in democratic countries.In Japan,many people are ignorant of and uninterested in politics.We usually exercise our political right when the elections are held,at least once a few years.But in particular situations,this frequency seems not quite enough.Peple in Japan should take more actions and try to reflect their thoughts on the politics."
1425,"I know what's going on in Brazil, but every time I hear about the news, I always think about a dilemma the gap between the rich and the poor and the developing of economy. As for the government of Brazil, it is important to hold the World Cap to show the economic power of Brazil. However, as for citizens, not few people don't care about the World Cap. They need a job and public service. The Government should act equally to both sides of people - those who are poor and those who want to get the benefit of the World Cap."
1426,"To be shame, I think that spy is a virtual job in the movie. Frankly, I was so exciting during reading this article, though I understand it is serious news. However, I expect that the number of spy will decrease. Now, more and more countries are controlled by information and most of information are treated not via a person but via Internet. So, I think that 'a digital spy' will be active in the future world."
1427,"I agree ID1329's comment. I also have never imagined such an old person could conquer a mountain. I think that all Japanese people should be proud of him. Not only he is a challenger not yield to the old but also he overcame the handicap, his broken pelvis and left thigh. He accomplished a great feat. Follow his amazing achievement, I bear a challenging spirit at everything in mind."
1428,"I don't think he did a very good job.Actually,he revealed the fact that there are lots of violating of human rights,but because of him some countries now cannot help avoiding the problems between other countries which they didn't want to touch.He caused visible conflicts around the world,some of which should be left untouched for the international peace.A perfectly clear government is impossible to be made,so I think he is a traitor."
1429,"I don't agree with ID1338's opinion that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before. According to the newspaper, the key point of 'Abenomics' is TPP. It seems to raise investment flows between the countries and further improve their economic growth, indeed, but the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country."
1430,"I don't agree with ID1338's opinion that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before. According to the newspaper, the key point of 'Abenomics' is TPP.

1431,"I agree ID1329's comment. I also have never imagined such an old person could conquer a mountain. I think that all Japanese people should be proud of him. Not only he is a challenger not yield to the old but also he overcame the handicap, his broken pelvis and left thigh. He accomplished a great feat. Follow his amazing achievement, I bear a challenging spirit at everything in mind."
1432,"I agree with ID1338. I was also surprised at his achievement. I want to be a great person like him. Therefore, I will try to challenge my limits every time."
1433,"I think that this article is like a movie, because I can not believe spy really exist. I want to support Edward Snowden as hero of ordinary people. He did not choose his safety, but choose citizens' safety. I think that almost people could not choose citizen's safety. Therefore, I am being sides with him."
1434,"I praise Edward Snowden for his act.I have two reasons for this. First, I think what he did is right , because his act could prevent National Security Agency from violating human rights. The act of U.S. surveillance programs could be invasion of privacy, so someone should stop it. Second, I want to praise him for his courage.If I were him, I couldn't leak information of NSA, because I would be afraid that I will lose my job and be arrested. So, I regard Edward Snowden as a hero."
1435,"I regard Edward Snowden as Traitor. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society. CIA employees should have been forced to keep information secret. Why did he do that seriously? It is dangerous for the CIA to keep the person like that because the law will be violated and all of the system will be in disorder. I think the CIA should find people who cannot obey its regulation to fire them. As you can see that I feel as though Snowden is Traitor, I do not agree with the idea of ID1346. I do not believe that international society also needs those who do action like him, because more people reveal international secrets, more countries will face the violation of the law. That leads the bad relationship with other countries, even in globalization times. However, I agree with ID1318 when he says Snowden has caused visible conflicts around the world. It can be said that a gulf has formed between Russia and the U.S. To eliminate unnecessary conflict globally, we should keep some information on our own."
1436,"When I heard this news, at first, I thought Edward had done virtuous conduct. However, after reading this article, I realized there was the exact opposite opinion that his action had been treason. Even though I still think his action was brave, because he tried telling us the fact despite the risk, I also think there is something in what they say. We often want to know facts but it is truth that there are sometimes facts which disturb the social order. As the saying goes, 'uso mo hoben(嘘も方便)', which means it is sometimes necessary to lie. Facts are not always helpful for us, so I think it is very difficult to solve such information issue."
1437,"I agree with ID1311's opinion. We are controlled easily by the mass medias.In this case, some medias reported about the explosion in Boston too much instead of reporting about car bombs in Iraq or the earthquake striking Iran and Pakistan. Actually, I knew about the explosion but didn't know the details of others. So, as ID1311 said, to make our knowledge wider the mass medias should spread the world's journalism ."
1438,"I agree with ID1328's opinion. The world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation about this kind of gun. As he said, it is one of the good ideas to restrict to download the blueprints. Even though it is not commonplace for people to own a 3D plastic printer yet, it will spread in the near future. If it happens, people will be able to make many kinds of things including dangerous things, and the society will be in danger. So it is important to solve this issue quickly."
1439,"For example, let's think about the case that one officer who works at Japan Coast Guard leaked a video of Chinese ship's attack at Senkaku. In the case the uploader was forced to retire the job because he transgressed the duty to keep the secret. But the leak revealed the government's conceal and he got so much support by many people and it led him to be innocent. But in this case, Edward Snowden doesn't seem to reveal government's definitive corruption, and only to be said 'valiant'. I can't praise the action like him because he didn't make the result to be a hero."
1440,"I agree with your opinion. I hope that The World Cup will success and life of Brazilian will be better than now. I think the demonstrate has good effect for changing ideas of the government too. Now, 209 countries and regions are members of FIFA. The number is more than the number of members of UN, 193 countries. So you understand how much soccer is popular, didn't you? There are not few poor countries in the world including Brazil. But I think sports have huge power , so development of sports can make life of people better. So it is so good chance for Brazil to develop. Of course there are so many and difficult problems and Brazil cannot solve them by oneself. So advanced nations, of course including Japan, should help for Brazil and I hope The World Cup will success for development of soccer and Brazil."
1441,"I red your comment and I had different ideas from you. Of course your idea isn't mistake completely, but it is too pacifism. I think wars are never gone unless human is exterminated.So weapons are needed forever. In Constitution of Japan a war is prohibition, but it means war of aggression and it doesn't include war of aggression. So we must have weapons for attack of foreign country. Japanese is Peace at any price mind set including you, but weapons will be needed someday. So the skill to make guns by 3D printer is so useful!"
1442,"I agree with ID1357's opinion. I also did not know about 3D printer until I read this article. The spread of 3D printer for private citizens is so dangerous, because they can make weapons and use them easily. Therefore, I think that the government of each countries must establish new law over treatment of 3D printer and increasing consciousness of danger to 3D printer is must."
1443,"I cannot decide whether he is a hero or a traitor. Of course he did break a law and it is not something to be praised. But thanks to him, we could know the information of NSA. His action was really brave and if I were him I would be too afraid to leak the information. It is too difficult for me to decide which side I should agree but there is one we all need to think about: privacy rights."
1444,"I think he didn't have to expose that NSA collect call data from major U.S. cell carriers. He just confused the public. But the other day, I read an article about U.S. citizen tolerate that, NSA was collecting call data from major U.S. cell carriers, to prevent terrorism. NSA said they did interception to prevent terrorism. I understand, of course it's necessary for national defense. On the other hand, many country said 'our national sovereignty was infringed.' I can understand both opinion. National defense and fighting against terrorism are so difficult issues. I think we have to think about those issues."
1445,"First of all, I' d like to admire Edward Snowden's brave action and regard him as a hero. I know what he did is unlawful and so he has received much more criticism or anger than admiration. However the most important fact is not its legality, but the details leaked by Snowden. He revealed that the U.S. authorities are monitoring each nation. Though they explain the program aims at preventing terrorism, I suppose it will be a total loss for general public. People probably don't want to be kept watch because of terrorism measures. In short, the program of NSA is vicious and we should take a look at this point. This article doesn't include opinions of the ordinary people. I think their opinions are more honest and significant because VIPs in the government or some organizations often say their thoughts by political position, not their own one."
1446,"I strongly agree with your idea. When trying to make vocabulary notes, we always generally reluctant to take notes in a well-constructed style. Although I was also making a special vocabulary notebook like a dictionary before, now I regard repeat reading and writing as the most important way to memorize words. Making own notes only gave us wrong fulfillment while it doesn't gave firm knowledge. Therefore, I think making vocabulary notes is not always effective to learn words."
1447,"I don't think people should continue demonstrating for a long time. When I did research in Brazil society and economy last year, I realized many people are still suffering from poverty while Brazil economy has been growing rapidly. So I am convinced that they demand raising the quality of public services. But the issue of hosting the Cups and Olympics is not related to the demo because people were jumping for joy when Brazil won the right to host them. I think it is not proper for people to make complaints in this period of time."
1448,"According to this article,''Edward Snowden has been hailed as a hero of civil liberties and rebuked as a self-absorbed traitor for revealing information on classified National Security Agency programs aimed at preventing terrorism'.I think it is hard to decide whether he is traitor or hero.However,I have the only answer.In short,he is hero if you are people.he is traitor if you are CIA."
1449,"I agree your opinion. I think the medias have to report any incident even if terrorism was happened in small country. Of course, it is the best that there is no incident to report."
1450,"I don't think he is a hero. It is true that the information he revealed is very serious problem. NSA shouldn't do such a thing for getting some useful information. However, it doesn't mean that he can justify his action. His action was unworthy of a secret agent. If he knew some information that the government did something wrong, he must have guard the secret. An agent has to guard the secret until he dies."
1451,"I think that Edward Snowden is not a hero. I also think that whatever some reasons he has, he should not leak classified information on U.S."
1452,"I agree with your opinion. In fact, Japanese society has been aging because of several reasons,for example, a calamity and the recession. I want Japanese society will be get well gradually by reading this article."
1453,"I disagree with your opinion because he thinks that there is nothing we can do about making noise by children . I think that if parents discipline children, children understand it is not good to make noise in public."
1454,"I disagree with ID1338's opinion. Of course guns injure person. But in US, policemen uses guns to keep the country safe and some people uses guns for their hobbies, such as hunting. I think it is difficult to call them 'gangsterism'. You should think why guns became being needed before you declare guns are only instrument that injure person."
1455,"I agree with ID1330's opinion. I also think children are vigor and noisy, and they aren't social nuisance. Unless they act as they want, our lives lose power to live. So adults should have wider heart to tolerate them. And to make the world nearer to children's lives,the idea that the housings nearby school or daycare center must be reduced the price sounds nice to me."
1456,"I agree with your opinion. I also think it is dangerous horribly that the plastic gun readily available. I came up with it to regulate it in each countries, but it is insufficient when viewed from the standpoint of counter-terrorism. So, I feel the plan to regulate it using the international law of you is great."
1457,"I agree to the idea that people who enjoy the news should pay attention to the news in a variety of the world. I think if we have an interest in various news, the media will meet the expectations and, cover a story about the case of each country distinction, and I believe knowing the news diverse in that way is a chance to live better and broaden our field of view."
1458,"I agree with your opinion that Yuichiro is lucky, and not everyone can become like him, but his results might give courage to people. I think I am encouraged to look at the people of same generation who are active in all respects animatedly. I hope that if we can take a year in good spirits. Did you tell the story of Yuichiro to your grandfather? I hope your story about this article bring a good effect to your grandfather!"
1459,"I can't answer this question,because this is difficult for me. Snowden broke low, but it is really bad!? If I have to answer this question, I will say 'He is hero' But I have obvious reason."
1460,"I would agree with ID1329's opinion. What Maeda and Hosaka said in the text makes sense. Though it is true that we should be tolerant of the noise that children make, they ARE still noisy and sometimes annoy us."
1461,"I partly disagree with ID1338's opinion. It is true that Edward Snowden has broken the law and he deserves punishment, but in terms of privacy issue, his act can be praised."
1462,"I agree with ID1307.Everyone makes noise when they are children.So,I also think it is unfair to take children to task for their noise.Today,their many people who always look after their own interests.Complains of those people will accelerate the decline of the number of children and birthrate.So,I think the noise children make should be allowed and people should have a broad mind too."
1463,"I partly agree with ID1333's idea.When I saw the news on TV,I knew that this technology has affirmative sides.For example,3D printer is applied to making clothing and medical instruments.So governments of each nation should regulate the risky use of 3D printer such as making plastic handgun by it.I think it is important to make sure of the facts,understand a use of the technology and think carefully about it."
1464,I agree with ID1361's idea.it is important to recognize that this problem is difficult to decide.Whethr he is hero or agitator will be clear by time.
1465,"We can't make a wholesale decision of whether Snowden is a hero or a traitor because we don't know the concrete information which Snowden leaked.It is true that classified information is important and the leak of the information may harm us,but at the same time,enforcement of the authority by the concealment of those information may strengthen the dictatorship and harm our freedom of life.And in my opinion,there are too many dark side in the US authority and this,Snowden's action is one of the step that may reveal the dark side to the people."
1466,"I agree to your opinion ,harry.Though the classified information may protect us from terrorism,surveillance against nation and whose people by single authority is a big problem,same as terrorism.Liberty should not be enjoyed by small part of nation or authority,it should be enjoyed by every people."
1467,"I think it's natural for kid to run around and make noises.Are children these days really getting more noisier and have bad manners than before?I don't think so.The reason why many people came to think them annoying is that the environment has changed.In this technological century,people became lonely and come to live by themselves.Communities are shrinking smaller and smaller and many of them are collapsing.What we have to do is not to shut those kids' mouth but to improve the education environment and make a child friendly society.Tolerate and considerate society will benefit not only the kids and parents but also the whole members of the society,I think."
1468,I agree to your opinion.The environment is what we have to think of.It is obvious that children can't think more than adults.We should think more and be tolerate for children and for ourselves in this aging society.Considerate mind and action against children will make the society more comfortable and last long term.
1469,"When I heard this news,I thought he is 'traitor'. There is not a organization like CIA in Japan,so we are unfamiliar with spying and this news is like movie and drama. He defects from his own country by a sense of justice in order to prosecute on line crimes of America. In this way,I think that he thinks 'hero' rather than 'traitor' himself. Consequently I can't decide that he is 'hero' or 'traitor'."
1470,"I agree with your idea that we should accept the noise of the children and make good environment for them. Surely,in Japan the number of children are decreasing now. So we should stand their noise and bring up them by surrounding people. We should have tolerance heart."
1471,"I can not agree with gamusyara's idea.If the nation allows the man like him,the nation will be destroyed by itself. In the first place,the government will not pervert the personal information.People should believe their government. Otherwise,they choose moving to other country or demurring to the government by the legitimate way."
1472,"To be honest, I hardly knew about 'Abenomics' before I read this article. I had thought it brings us a lot of good influences. But now I know it doesn't give us only good effects. And I understood why the prices of many things has gone up recently. Rising the price such as 'A McDonald's 100-yen Mac is now 120 yen' is not a big deal for rich people, but for people who are not rich this would be a big effects. I know it is very difficult to control the economics and give good effects to everyone but I hope this situation will get better."
1473,"I agree with your opinion.I think also Government of Brazil should consider Brazilians.Otherwise,Brazil will not probably join developed countries forever. If Brazil will become developing and getting ripe country and all people in Brazil will live happily,it should listen to the people's voice. I hope the World Cup in Brazil will success and all people in Brazil will enjoy it!"
1474,"I agree with naoenami's idea.The political affairs always become white wash and use a lie,but those action is to protect their nations.I think this case fits it,so Edward Snowden is a traitor. However, people must think about the government particularly and prevent the abuse of power."
1475,"I always use flash cards to learn new words. They are very easy to carry around and I can use them everywhere like on the train. And they are very easy to make, I just have to write the word on one side and on the other side I need to write meaning and something important. But the flash cards are not very big so they are not big enough to write example sentences or synonyms. After I read this article, I thought the second example is the best way to learn new words. It includes English meanings and example sentences. They would be very useful when you find the word in the long sentences next time."
1476,I agree with his idea. We all know everyone used to be children and make some noises. So people should be more tolerant with the noise of children. And I think it is very good idea that we need to think about the way to co-exist between children and the others.
1477,I agree with this comment. I also used flash cards to learn new words. But I also found learning English words in this way would not help when I talk to someone in English. I would like to find other good way to learn new words.
1478,"I don't agree with your opinion.Because I think people's salary will rise that can't say. And economics is difficult to be predicted.If 'Abenomics will continue by Prime Minister Abe after several years,it will not say that can guarantee to keep a good condition.So I hope 'Abenomics' will have a good effect on Japanese economy,but 'Abenomics' is not said to be effective yet."
1479,"When I heard this news, I thought that he was a traitor. As for the word 'spy', Japanese people may not have familiarity. Possibly, it may be the word heard on the one scene of a movie.However, the occupation of CIA exists in the United States. After all, the personnel should keep the secrecy in the course of duties, also after retiring and it is the body which is that it is required for a country though, as for it, the country is supervising people , I think."
1480,"I know Snowden broke the law but I think he is a hero because he did it for all American citizens as one American citizen not as a member of NSA. Many people in America, also in Japan, want to open all information but we did realize that the government hide many important information from this Snowden case. He made a sacrifice of his life and family to open information. This is a great decision, don't you think so?"
1481,I agree with your opinion. It is because leaking the secrecy of a state level has influence in respect of being various.
1482,"This thing is very difficult .As for his action,we can think both of right and wrong . I thought he is a hero at first, but I thought that on investigation he was a traitor. His action was not crime because it is an accusation .However, the action extinguishes the trust of a nation and the nation. All the actions that are not a crime may not be good. Only at the time of revolution, I could call him a hero."
1483,"Edward thinks that he is a hero. It is a crime surely to steal confidential information. However, Edward who gave the information which should be given to people is a hero. The secret of a country needs to be known by people. So that the secret is large. Edward is brave."
1484,"In my opinion, Edward Snowden did the wrong action that he leaked classified information on U.S. surveillance programs. Of course, his action enabled people in U.S. find that U.S. violated their privacy, however his action endangered people in U.S. Now that a lot of acts of terrorism happen in the world, and so the government have to take counter-terror measures. One of them is U.S's collecting call data from major U.S. cell carriers. I think that we should be willing for our government to violate our privacy in order to fly the approach of danger. In my conclusion, he is not a hero but a traitor."
1485,I disagree with your opinion. It is not bad to hold the World Cup is. it a working-out method of the budgets to be bad.I think that it becomes the profit of the nation by all means if we look in the long term.
1486,"I can not agree with mami's idea. I regard Edward as his being a hero. Because, I think that the people have to know all the countries."
1487,"He is a hero for American citizens. But I think he is a traitor. Because he received a salary from CIA. And the reason why he escapes is that he think I did a bad thing. If he think that I am a hero, he should not run away!"
1488,I agree with your opinion because the leak of information should not be done.
1489,"I agree with you. His success of challenge is so great thing that anyone cannot do. His great challenge encouraged me and makes me recognize the important of challenge, too. So I am going to challenge actively, even if it is difficult for me to accomplish."
1490,"I think spy is to be in the movie, too. And I agree your pinion that spy will decrease for spreading Internet."
1491,"I agree with you. I like soccer very much, and so I am really looking forward to World Cup. However, in Brazil there are more serious problems, such as a hike in public transport fares, than World cup. So the government in Brazil need to solve them first of all and should convince all people in Brazil to hold World cup, in my opinion."
1492,"If the consumption tax rise from 5% to 8%, I will be damaged. For example, if we buy something at average 100yen shop, I have to pay 108yen. If we buy 'Umaibo', we have to pay 11yen. Its sales will be down!"
1493,"I agree with ID1310's idea that his incredible activity cheer many old people.In near future, the most of population in Japan will be occupied old people. The person such as him cheers them and enlivens the economy ."
1494,"I expect the activity of Japan too. I look forward to Brazil World Cup, also Brazilian wait anxiously too. I think probably Brazilian don't oppose to holding the World Cup, they protest against the cost too high and economic disparity. If their lives is painful, they can't afford to enjoy World Cup. So I think government have to consider all of Brazilian's life."
1495,"I agree with you. Everyone was taken care of in society at the time of the child. Although this,one think child is annoying after growth to adult. I think this is very selfish. And children will shoulder the future destiny of our country. I think that we should become tolerant."
1496,"In my opinion,he is a hero because he disclosed the information that American government violates many people's privacy in order to change this corrupt situation,in spite of being exposed to great danger. Maybe various countries do such things but if no one stands up,no one has any question about that and the situation lasts forever.He is one of the few people that have the courage to stop that."
1497,"I don't agree with your idea. You said 'Abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all' ,but now some change is happening in the industrial world. Some big companies raised salary and gave bonus. This is clearly good for Japanese economy."
1498,"Some people see him as a hero , but I do not so so. Because leaking of classified information is a serious crime especially in America. America is influential country over the world. Therefore the action of Snowden should not be assessed 'hero' ."
1499,"I think 'Abenomics' is very good plan.The price of everything is rising,but salaries of people will be raising by companies.People should wait for good results from long term point of view.Because people wanted good results so early by now.Japanese people should have patience.In addition,only aiming for sensation,the mass media should not stir up worries of people.And we should pay much attention to the economy."
1500,"I disagree with your idea. It is not wonderful technology to make 3D-printed handgun, it is dangerous idea. We hope peace world. We hope the world nobody has weapons. I think if people can make gun easily, it is not good for us at all."
1501,"I was surprised to hear that there is a protest marching against World Cup.I thought it always brings positive outcomes especially in economics. I knew that corruption is one of the most serious issues in Latin-American countries, but I have nothing to say for that. If demonstration continues, it is inevitable to decline of the economy and urban function.I hope that Brazil will settle down soon."
1502,"I don't think he is a hero.I think every country has some top secrets,so officers shouldn't reveal them.Because it may lose the country's reputation.I want to ask him the reason why he revealed."
1503,"I think Edward Snowden is a hero. It is surely bad to steal information of the state secret. However the action uncovered the injustice that the United States performed and announced it to the world, and became an opportunity to let us think about importance of the information and national trust. In addition to it he abandoned a previous living to leak information. For such a reason, I think that his action was right."
1504,"I always played TV game at home, I was very quiet, because I was very hard to play it! My mother also say 'Play at the park!' I say 'YES' But I go to my friend house, because I can eat a lot of cake!"
1505,"I agree with you. Children should make a noise, that is natural. The only thing we need to teach to children is 'You should be filled with curiosity many thing around you.' instead of 'Do not make a noise everywhere!'"
1506,"I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi. We have to set forward child-bearing issues. The social agenda is that to make people think that curious children are needed for our future. I would like parents and adults to notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises. Children should have curiosity everything, make a noise, and be blown away a lot of things."
1507,"I cannot judge whether Edward Snowden is a hero or a traitor. Some people think he is a hero. Others think he is a traitor.Leaking U.S. information is bad thing, but I think this action may be indispensable for the society. Everything has many aspects like this news. Especially, the national matter like this cannot be judged easily."
1508,"This news is really amazing!! I can't believe it. Mr. Miura had climbed Mt. Everest many times. His body is really strong and healthy I thought. He is Japan's proud, and there're effect of advertising of Japan. That is good thing for us and he brighten up Japanese and all over the world's people."
1509,"I agree with her. Most of people have the same experiences when they were children, so they should be lenient with them. Children will become leaders in the future."
1510,To note is very important thing when we learn new words. Writing words and phrases is helpful to us to study. I want to use word map to skill up my vocabulary.
1511,"I think he is a traitor. For some people, what the US government did was shocking, but for others, it could be predicted. These days, there are many surveillance cameras around us and anyone's private information can be accessed. We often open our privacy to a whole world by ourselves such as uploading pictures and writing blogs. In such an information-oriented society, protecting the nation from terrorists could be a right reason to keep watching information. Turning to Edward Snowden, he took out classified information out of the US. His action may expose American citizens to danger. This is the opposite to of the purpose of the US government. That's why I think he is a traitor."
1512,"I agree with ID1342's idea. Not just plastic guns but usual metal guns should be prohibited. In the US, people buy guns to protect their families and property, yet guns took their precious lives. The fact that anyone can make plastic guns easily means that anyone can kill people around them easily. It must not be allowed."
1513,"After I red this article, I thought that Snowden is hero. According to the law, the freedom of speech is guaranteed. In addition Snowden is so brave. It is also the condition to be a hero."
1514,"I agree with ID1314's take. I think only investors and big trading company have made profits and ordinary people cannot find any benefits of Abenomics. If Mr. Abe's 'groundless' policies met with failure, it would take much time to recover Japanese economy."
1515,I think that rising in prices of everything is necessary for Japan. But I don't want Abe to rise in prices of everything . Because the tax that I pay now is only consumption. So rising consumption is big problem for me.
1516,"I don't agree with the idea that the number of spy will decrease. It is true that most intelligence are gathered by the Internet. However, secret national intelligence couldn't be gathered by the Internet because a lot of governments may be on the watch for cyber attack. I think the most important intelligence might be gathered by human beings."
1517,"When I was a high school student, I didn't make vocabulary notebooks very much.Instead of making my own vocabulary notebooks,I used one which were pressed.[ID1342] said in comment that ' I used 'TARGET 1900′ to memorize English word. I don't know whether it is good or not.' I think that is good,because buying and using vocabulary notebooks which which words are already printed on can saving time."
1518,"No matter how he praised as a hero, no matter how morally right his action was, as a result, it is illegal and he should not bring the classified information out. Some say that what NSA did itself is illegal, but the U.S. court must treat this as 'political question'. In any way, Snowden has no escape, but his action surely arouses public opinion. It must judges what NSA have done."
1519,"I agree with your opinion, especially, 'climbing is a reason for living for Mr.Miura'. Now I'm just a student of certain university. So it may be difficult to discover own reason for living as Mr.Miura's. But students as I have a lot of time that we can use freely. In school life, we will be able to find something that we challenge our limits.Until that time, we have to live studiously."
1520,"I am opposed to this opinion. The United States is a leading country in the world. If not all countries are equal, they will not be nice. It is not allowed just because it is a strong country."
1521,"I agree with your idea. Japanese government slights demonstrations. However, the number of people who participate in demonstration is very different. In Japan, we cannot imagine that 800,000 people protest against the government. I think Japan is a very peaceful country."
1522,I approve of this opinion. Brazil is holding the chance. It is holding the World Cup. I expect that it will be held by me in Brazil. It will certainly have influence good for Brazil.
1523,"This news was shocking to me. Guns can make easier than before, and are made by general person like us. It is really dangerous i think. If guns are made by children or criminals, that's really serious news! Of course blue print gives us a lot of good skill, but also it is really danger. So we have to make a mature rule when we use a 3D printer."
1524,"I regard Edward Snowden as a traitor. His exposure endangered US people. For example, he exposed that NSA hacked China. This damaged the human rights diplomacy, which US made for China. The relations between US and China are so important for the all countries because two countries have the mighty influence on them in various aspects, such as the military, economy, and politic. Therefore, his act worsened the relations between two countries and endangered not only US people but also all people in the world."
1525,"I agree with ID1310's opinion. It is natural that children make noise. We should not get angry at it, because children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly"
1526,"I think he is hero. He leaks secret information of The U.S..Leaking information is illegal,but that information is unacceptable.By Snowden,we know the way of The US to collect information.However,he can't go back to The US."
1527,"I can't agree the opinion.Snowden escaped in several countries,but I think he don't regret leaking.He may be under sentence of death penalty in The US,so he must run away."
1528,"I agree with ID1312's opinion. It is surely this technology is very comfortable, but it is more likely to be abused. However the technique is necessary to make our life better more. I want to establish the regulation method before this technique is generalized"
1529,"I think that he is a hero because he searched a lot of information it is US's secret and unacceptable . I also think that to leak information without being permitted is wrong, but I guess he wanted us to know how US is."
1530,"Now, Edward Snowden is the person much talked about, and there are both side which praise him and which blame him. Actually, I don't know about it with many details and whether he is a hero or a traitor. It seem to be a right action, but some says that it put American at risk. However, I respect the way of Snowden's acting. He did it because he believed it right, though it won't be profitable for himself but risky. I can't think of revealing some national important information, but I do want to live with my belief."
1531,"I can't agree with your opinion. It is fact that Abenomics make tax rise.But this will make good affection to our life. For example, employment rate will rise by spread money.So we have to stand high taxes."
1532,"I think Edward Snowden is traitor. Edward Snowden leak top secrets of NSA. Certainly,if NSA listened in on EU and China's information,it is illegal.But it is higher politic issue.So this news is controversial now.USA's secret service is not permitted. But Edward Snowden isn't also permitted."
1533,"I agree with you. I think media have duty to tell public wider information, but we also have faults now. media didn't publish about them just because we usually don't pay attention to them much, so we should change ourselves at first."
1534,"I agree with ID1306's opinion. I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news."
1535,"I think Snowden is traitor. Certainly, impeaching with intelligence by CIA has a few good points. But also an obligation to keep official secrets is important for society. I think intelligence by CIA in this case isn't problem that have to impeaching. This impeaching has only bad influence upon America. This impeaching is for him rather than society."
1536,"This problem is very important. Developing countries sometime be attracted not much attention. Why? Because I think that people take notice about major countries, and developed countries have information technology better than developing countries. We have to look at the world with a broad view."
1537,"I think media's great attention to this news is natural. Because the United States has been fighting with terrorist since 9/11 had occurred. After that terrible incident, not only American but also world people becomes sensitive about terrorism in America. It is true that other news are important, but this news is much more important than others."
1538,I agree with him. I also want to be a challenging man. Now I join club activity and challenge to my limit but Mr.miura's challenge is done with more and more big scale in spite of his age. I really respect him and his mental.
1539,"I disagree with ID1319 's opinion.I think demonstration is higher politic movement. Revolution is illegal. But demonstration is legal. Certainly, violent demonstration is not good. But legal demonstration should be continued.So Brazil's demonstration is not settled down easily."
1540,"I agree with him. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment."
1541,I agree with your opinion. Unconsciously we tend to lay stress on western country's affair and ignore middle eastern or African country's affair. But now we live in global age. We have to have wide range of view.
1542,"I agree with you. I think that the purpose of World Cup is originally making people happy, so it will be like cart before the horse if we hold it under the situation that people don't wish to be held."
1543,"I disagree with your comment. Because I think demonstration can't avoid violence. If protests continue demonstration, people who are injured increase. Protests have to think another way for change the government."
1544,I was so amazed when I heard about this great old men. I think his desire to climb Everest itself gives him energy and power. He may gives his generation a lot of hope. I want him to continue to climb Everest from now on.
1545,"I agree with your comment. I think so that 'Abenomics' are not bad for economy, but it's stopgap measure. If the ground of Japanese economy strong, we can say 'Abenomics' succeed in recovering Japanese economy."
1546,I think that this movement was good thing and necessary. Because I think citizen should show government their opinion. And this movement could show government their opinion. So government understood their opinion and I think this is the first step to improve .
1547,"Before I read this article, I didn't know Snowden. So I surprised when I read this article. And I think Snowden is traitor. Because I think there are lots of informations which should be kept in the world and I think this information is the one which have to be kept. So I think he is traitor."
1548,I agree with nanamino415. I also got courage from him and I thought that I could do everything if I tried it very hard.
1549,"I agree with you. I think too that Mr.Miura changed many people,especially old people's mind and encouraged them to try various things,even difficult ones. I also hope the world will be filled with the dream this way."
1550,I have different opinion from ID1331. I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news.
1551,"I can't agree to this comment completely. Information may be more and more gathered on 'the Internet world', but the security against this new world must be more and more strengthened. And of course,the secret of each country won't be leaked so easily. So the spy like what they are now will be remained and will continue to have the importance."
1552,"I disagree with you because mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. I think it is impossible for mass media to do equally.However, I want to say too that it shouldn't ignore the news that they think affects fewer people."
1553,"I think he is both hero and traitor. Of course he broke the low,and it is absolutely bad thing. But also this age of international society needs the action like him."
1554,"I agree with you.The World Cup may be able to bring Brazilian the development and money,but it is the matter of future. the government must understand that there are now lots of people live in poverty."
1555,"The World Cup may be able to bring Brazilian the development and money,but it is the matter of future. the government must understand that there are now lots of people live in poverty."
1556,"I do not know much about this news, however, I think he is a traitor. It is true that his behavior has some positive effects on the U.S. citizen, however he spoiled the U.S. national interest. I guess he is a betrayer. The U.S. government should punish him severely."
1557,"I agree with your opinion.I think the government cannot completely save economy now 'Abenomics'.It is not only' Abenomics', and a different policy is necessary for Japan.we should think about what is the most important'."
1558,"I'm agree with your opinion that people should watch children warmly,because it is impossible for children to make no noise. So we should understand children and tolerate their noise."
1559,"I don't agree with you. Of course, terrorism maybe happen in Japan. But the most important point of this news is GAP I think. If we understand about contemporary condition of all over the world clearly, we can be more kind to other country, other people. So we have to require continual awareness of world before concern about terrorism."
1560,"I disagree with her. I know that it is natural for children to make noise. However, sometimes the noise make the neighbor irritated. Children do not know that their noise cause problems, so their parents ought to talk them not to make too much noise."
1561,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor because the government will not abuse any information they research. He let out the important secret information all over the world, in spite of the fact that he was the former CIA employee, which is disgraceful for American society."
1562,I agree with ID1317's idea. I also regard Edward as his being a hero. It is because he provided us with information.
1563,"I disagree with your opinion that 'people should find former big profit than a short-term loss for two years or three years.' I don't think that no money is the only reason for this demonstration .Brazilian got angry because government didn't' work well.So if there was lots of money, Brazilian would demonstrate because the government is not good."
1564,"I agree with her. We seldom pay attention to the developing countries. Newspapers do not report such incidents in the developing countries. As she says, we have to look at the world with a broad view."
1565,"I think Snowden is both a traitor and a hero. I don't decide which I should agree. On one side, he broke the low and it is not forgiven as a American citizen. But other side, he is so brave because he leaked it at the risk of his life."
1566,"i agree with you.guns only can harm people,we cannot create its too much. a nation have to make a law to ban the plastic guns and guarantee the safety of citizens."
1567,i agree with you. a world cup must be a event that makes people happy.
1568,I agree with Keisuke. I also think he could do this with his family's support! I want to treasure the family's trust.
1569,"I didn't agree with Keisuke. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. So I want to insist 3D plastic printers have to be illegal!"
1570,"There are many opinions about the Abenomics. Some say it endangers Japan's agriculture, others say like the articles. But the deflation that has been for 20 years itself is clearly bad situation. The Abenomics actually changes the situation. If it gives us bad effects, then we think about it. As Japanese government has taken no actions (as a result, the deflation continued), we shouldn't oppose the new actions without effective solution."
1571,I learned two things for good presentation. The first point is to memorize the manuscript. It is important to do clear presentation because I can always see the listener and utter clear pronunciation. Second is to make the clear slide. The pictures and figures so much attracted to the context make the listener understand the contents easily.
1572,"When I read this article, I was amazed how sophisticated today's technology is. Today's technology becomes more and more convenient. Actually such technology improves our lives, but we should be careful the way we use it. It could be danger if we use it wrong way."
1573,"I agree with Abenomics.Of course prices are staying high but in the future,salaries will be raised and consumer will be more active.People should expect for this profit."
1574,"I was shocked by this article at first. Children shouldn't be noisy? But after reflection,I noticed Japan's society is changing little by little. This society is aging little by little. Like old days play by lots of children should be cared not to disturb the lives of elderly people."
1575,"I disagree with your opinion. Actually development of 3D-guns includes some risk, but it can improve technology. Today, technology is always around our lives. We can no longer live without technology."
1576,"Once people complains over the child noise, parents may wither. If Japanese birth rate declines thanks to this, it's too late. Surely people are tend to be under stress, but it cannot be a reason to complain about noisy children. As long as the connection with local community disappears, we must care about what we do or say."
1577,I can understand the claim that children are noisy. Sometimes I feel so when I stay at home. But we must tolerate such feeling. Children consists of foundation of a country. We have to educate them freely.
1578,"I don't agree with you. Don't regard this matter as emotional matter. Nobody knows why he leaked the information.,but his actions clearly endangers the U.S. itself. As long as the country has the biggest power around the world, you should care about the bad effect that caused the leak."
1579,"Before I read this article,I thought that Abenomics is very marvelous policy and includes no risk. But it becomes to be wrong. Actually it may contains some risk, but I hope it will success and Japanese economy will revive."
1580,I absolutely agree with you.The legal regulation like the law is not always effective.So we need to do something more fundamental about this issue.
1581,"I think Snowden is a traitor. I can understand he was so brave,but I don't think to leak secret informations of NSA was meaningful. Because, I think his actions threatened the state and citizens. The activities of NSA is for protect the nation from terrorism. Regardless it is justice or not, there are some truth which is better not to know in the world."
1582,"I would like to complain to these complainers.For sure,parents should always keep their eyes on their children and be considerate toward other people.However,it is very natural for children to make noise and all of us used to do it in our own childhood.With the widespread use of compute,children have less chance to play outside today.Playing loudly is absolutely needed for children to grow up soundly.Considering today's aging society and Japan's future,adults should be a little more tolerant toward noisy children."
1583,"As for his action, it would be so careless in terms of his position. maybe it is caused of exposing his nation to danger. I can't praise for his behavior, but I agree with his opinion. According to the news, the embassy was bugged by American government. He probably couldn't excuse such movement. I also think it too exceeding and his action is right."
1584,I think mass-media should report the most important news many times. I think other news also should be reported. But I think important news should be reported more than other news. I think mass media need to report the news that affects more people preferentially. They should not make any different between countries.
1585,"I think Edward Snowden is a traitor.As he is a member of CIA,he shouldn't leak the information of the nation.CIA has kept secrets,so U.N. can conduct state affairs smoothly.If the member of a national information betrays the government like him,people in the country will be confused and it can't maintain public order.He should have known the influence of U.N. and been aware of his responsibility as a member of CIA."
1586,"I disagree with his opinion.People in Brazil have no choice but protest by violence.if they could not do so,this does government harm."
1587,I thought Abenomics is only a good policy. But this article said Abenomics have dangerous sides. People tend to support a sort term success.We should see a long term about Abenomics.
1588,I could get a new viewpoint from this comment. I'm so excited and looking forward to Olympic game in Tokyo. And I just think it is good for poor people to grow the economy by hosting the games. I learned we should consider the gap between the rich and the poor.
1589,"I almost agree with your opinion. Japanese prime minister Abe is getting Japanese economy recovered , but, on the other hand, he encourages public works. The Government shouldn't provide a cover for public works by the Abenomics."
1590,"I don't think him as a hero,because some international problems can be visible ones due to him.International conflicts can turn into wars,which makes people unhappy.He touched the problems which should be untouched,so I don't agree with you."
1591,"After I red this article, I'm happy that he was elected. Of course I can't agree with all of his ideas, but I want him to hang on!"
1592,"I agree with you.He violated the most important principle to keep the secrets as a CIA employee,so we cannot value him high."
1593,"World cup is one of the biggest event all over the world. And host country could get a lot of economic benefit. So,it is natural that every country wants to held World cup in their country. But a country must take care not only economic benefit but also country's social problem such as unemployment rate."
1594,"I agree with you. Countries must protect its secret information. Although fundamental human rights should not be ignored, but I think interests of a country is more important because only countries make sure that people live peaceful lives."
1595,"It is exciting to watch the worldwide event in our own country,so I was very confused when I first read this article.I can never imagine that I demonstrate against staging the World Cup in Japan.However,it is only because Japan is not so much suffering financial crisis and the standard of living in Japan is comparatively stable. Governments should not do things that doesn't match the present situation of their countries."
1596,"I worried about it would have a bad effect of holding World Cup in Brazil. Certainly, to host World Cup bring their nation a lot of profit. It must be useful to rise their standard of living. I'm sure that it will guide the nation to be happiness."
1597,"Seeing from American government and CIA,he would be a traitor. And in fact,he is a criminal. But I'd like to praise the courage of his that do not care about the risk for the sake of justice."
1598,"I I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news.When I was a child, around people tolerant toward me and once in a while I was scold. So I was raised by not only my parents but also people around me. I hope people around children get tolerant toward children and children should be raised local people."
1599,"I think the rapid changes in these days is scaring.In fact,I haven't got any jobs and paid my own living so far,and it is hard for me to realize the actual changes in economy directly,but compared to history,and considering the economical situation of past few years,the change seems too rapid.We cannot conclude whether the economic policy is right only from predictions,but if this is bubble economy,I'm pretty scared of the time for me to get a job."
1600,"It is true that Edward Snowden commit a crime,I think he did right thing seeing from moral point. From American view point, his action was guilty. But from Korean and Chinese view point, his action was innocent."
1601,I agree with ID1361's idea.it is important to recognize that this problem is difficult to decide.Whethr he is hero or agitator will be clear by time.
1602,I think these protest should be apart from sports event like world cup. The government should make sure that socially disadvantaged people can lead lives where they do not cause such demonstrations. I hope that Brazil solve them completely and the World Cup is held in Brazil
1603,"I agree with you. Abenomics depends on the theory, so it discords with the real economy. Moreover, the blessing that Abenomics gives us is only for the rich. For example, investors get big money from high stock prices, while the poor does not have enough money to invest, so they cannot share the blessing. To make Japanese economy more stable and extensive, Abenomics has to make allowance for not only the rich, but the poor."
1605,"I was really surprised about this news and I also worry about the news. This is because protest's movement is really dangerous thing. I think I am not able to understand what Brazilian people think about this news, because of I am Japanese. But, World Cup would bring a lot of profit for Brazil. As a result of this, standard of living of Brazilian people will rise. So that I think movement of government is good, but government need to care about their citizens."
1606,"When I first heard about this news,I was really surprised, because 80-year-old man climbed the Mt. Everest . My grandmother is 78 years and my grandfather is 82 years and both grandparents have difficulties in walking.So I think Mr Miura is miracle."
1607,"I think Snowden urged us to reconsider. What are information, privacy, national secret...? It's perplexing problem. With the advance of the Internet, the amount of information is increasing and our privacy is decreasing I think. I don't know what is correct and what is important about our privacy and national interests. In this way, I think Snowden is a HERO because we could notice our life are watched by SOMEONE."
1609,"I can't agree with you. I can understand you mean that dangers in the world are not diminished,and 3D printer has a big impact but that is all. However I think it has greatly positive and negative effects on our daily lives. As we deal with every one thing seriously, the world we live can be changed ."
1610,I really shocked about this news. This is because the government which need to safe the right of privacy harmed citizens. They harmed citizens right is really annoying thing. I can't imagine that. So this news was really shocking news for me and I can't believe.
1611,"I was not interested in a 3D printer very much,but when I read this article,I get interested in the technology.The technology has some dangerous points,but I understand the useful way.However,guns are very dangerous.I think 3D printer need some rules so that it is not used for bad things."
1612,"Abenomics has the risk,but it will be effective economic policy for the time being. Growth strategy after this is really important."
1613,"I don't agree with you.He is not in a position to leak the nation´s information.If U.N. allow him to do it,people who do the same thing will increase.As he broke the low,he should be published."
1614,"I agree with your idea. I also think children are vigor and noisy, but they aren't social nuisance. And your idea which adults should have wider heart to tolerate children is totally same as me!!"
1615,"I dis agree you.Abenomics has the risk,but it will be effective economic policy for the time being."
1616,"I agree with your opinion.I was very surprised, too! I think he encourages not only elderly people but also Japanese people!! I was also encouraged! :) Japanese elderly population is increasing and birth rate is decreasing.. But I think we can resume to have dream and make effort by his action. I hope Japan will be more cheerful!!"
1617,I cannot agree with his opinion. We cannot judge whether he is a hero or a traitor. It is very difficult matter.
1618,I disagree with your idea. This is because I don't think Abenomics' is not good plan. This is because price of every things are rising is harmful for poor people. I think one of the important recent problem of Japanese government is poor people cannot rise to the normal. So that Abenomics' is not good plan for Japan.
1619,I was so shocked to know more and more people are complaining about the noise of children because it is natural that they make some noise when playing outside. The saddest thing is that some Japanese aren't afford to permit the noise of the child.
1620,"I read your comments and I agree with your opinion that handguns can make by 3D printer. This means anyone can have handguns near the future.. I think we have to make the rules or laws about 3D printer and use with safety. In Japan, we are more peaceful than other countries so,we have to keep or improve this condition....!!"
1621,"I agree with you.Even the people can get the information that has been secret,the risk of leaking is bigger problem than its advantage."
1622,I think this media reaction is strange because making too much attention to Boston marathon's incident and not making so much attention to incidents which occurred around the world is wrong thing.So I think this media reaction is not correct.
1623,"I was very surprised at the news very much and also feel happy to know there is a vigorous Japanese old man.I want to live actively like Yuichiro Miura.In Japan, aging is a very serious problem.However, active old man's stories make us happy,so I think that is very good."
1624,"I agree with your opinion. Brazilian people protest about the government policies. Therefore, the government should reflect the popular will and improve the social security. If the government solve the problems and host World Cup smoothly, it can get big money and prosper increasingly."
1625,"What is most important for doing good presentation is having confidence in my own presentation,I suppose.If I have no confidence,my voice is getting smaller and communications between me and listeners are getting difficult. I think it is also important to make it clear why I want to make listeners know the contents of my presentation.It helps me speech logically."
1626,This article is very useful and makes us to think about how we should study English. I think third example is best. I believe that we are easy to remember new words with sentences. So using speech and so on is very good for us.
1627,Abenomics has positive points and negative points.Policies of economy often have risks.But it is better to carry out policies than not to carry out anything.Sooner or later the result of Abenomics will be clear.
1628,"I learned 3 things from my presentation. To make a better presentation, the most important process is to find a good material that is easy to understand and interesting. Second, confidence is important at a presentation. Also, I feel that I have to make my presentation much more clearly next time and I want to do presentation better than this time."
1629,Great!
1630,I disagree with your opinion. Because secrecy of a country should not be leaked in any situations.
1631,"This is shocking news.Twitter sometimes use in crimes.We should be careful to use media such as Twitter,FaceBook.The nurse is pitiable."
1632,I agree with your opinion because the money given by sponsor and a lot of tourists is enormous
1633,I think he is very tough.Climbing Everest is very hard for young people.A lot of people have given up climbing to the top.I was cheer up by Mr.Miura.
1634,"Abenomics is a Abe's political strategy. It's a plan to recover Japanese finance. Actually, almost of Japanese citizens expect it. Now, Not only a big company but also a lot of small businesses support Japanese economy. So I think 'Abenomics' should have a good effect to them. Unless do it, 'Abenomics' won't success"
1635,I'm sad because it can say SNS killed the nurse. I think it is the worse aspect of the SNS.
1636,"I agree with your opinion.We should accept and patient the children's noises.Everyone was child,so we(adult) should watch stare children."
1637,I agree the opinion. I think government protects citizens and The World Cup.
1638,"snowden should be punished. Even if there are some reasons,it is illegal."
1639,"I was shocked when I read this article because there are clearly the gap of motivation for World Cup between the nation and world. In fact,the World Cup should bring development and money. Although I think it is good to stage the World Cup in Brazil, the government should make Brazilian social peaceful. No one can enjoy soccer game in the situation. So, we have to help Brazil and make more peaceful this nation."
1640,"I agree with you. Edward Snowden 's action is right. His action is caused by cruel espionage by American government. Not to expose his nation danger. Recently, American government is chasing him persistently. I want him to run away from them."
1641,I was shocked to hear the news. I think this happening is like a 9.11. It is very horrible.I wonder why some people do such a horrible act. I think these media say wrong and different things.It is cruel for many victims
1642,"In order to make Japan better,economic policies are essencial.Of course a weak yen is not the only good thing,but any economic policy has ambiguity.Abenomics has 3 course of action.To make economic policy successful is probably difficult,but I expect Mr.Abe will do well in the long term.Japan's Prime Minister always change soon,but political success need long time.Therefore,I want Mr.Abe to do carefully over a long time."
1643,I disagree with you. it is more important to make efforts preparing for WC. Since WC has been decided to be held.
1644,"I agree with you. The World Cup is the most exciting event. If this movement won't finish, The World Cup maybe won't be able to held in the future. Unless Brazilian economy is recovered, the movement will never finish. The World Cup will make a lot of profit, so I expect Brazilian economy is improved."
1645,"I think this machine is an epoch making invention but it will be a weapons when people use this in a different way. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment."
1646,"I don't agree with you.For sure,staging events such as World cup will bring profits to Brazil.However,it is very risky and it can cause more violent protests from citizens."
1647,"I cannot understand at all because I do not know well about Abenomics but I think Abenomics is a good plan because the price of everything is rising, I will study more about Abenomics from now."
1648,"I think Snowden is a hero. Certainly he broke the law, but excessive nationalism is bad for people and a accuser is necessary."
1649,I agree with your opinion. I think he is courageous too.
1650,I disagree with your opinion. The laws are not always right.
1651,"I think most people don't realize that downloading free music will be punished. This problem won't be solved because it is very convenience and do not use any money. In fact , I did it 3 or 4 times but I never do this act any more because there are many people who are in trouble."
1652,I think he is a traitor and criminal. The media report as if he were a great hero-he sacrificed lover and money and steady life for his conscience. But in the first place he violated the law. The people in the U.S. have duty to obey the domestic law. His act can leads to disorder so we cannot value him as a hero.
1653,"In Brazil,many people believe that the government ignores the people's lives,and it seems a natural reaction. But I think the decision of the government is a reasonable one. The problem is that the government could not make the people understand that their policy make some benefits to them in the end. How reasonable their policy is, if not be understood, they naturally lose their trust."
1654,"I think Abenomics has produced a economic bubble.The definition of economic bubble is 'trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values.'This applies to the economic in these days. But the media reports the positive dimension alone,and we can say we are deceived by them and the government. Thus it is difficult for us to grasp the real situation only from the information provided,and we have to learn to acquire what is called media literacy."
1655,"The situation surrounding the birth rate is harsh indeed. Society seems less accustomed to children. But the faults lie in the parents as well. Many of them seem to take it for granted to be treated specially, and children and parents with no common sense are increasing. Both society and parents have to compromise each other, otherwise this problem has no solution."
1656,"I think it sad that Japanese are losing one of their traditions. But the situation changes. In Japan each people used to learn reading, writing and calculating in their local community. Now the educational system has been changed into the Occidental way, and computers have developed. It also seems we should not stick to the handwriting culture. I think we should separate the handwriting and typewriting, and handwriting should be passed down as cultural one."
1657,I think he is incredible and this article will encourage not only elderly people but also young people.I came to think that I would like to challenge and try things confronting with me and my limits after I read this article.
1658,"I think this news is awful.The reason that I think making guns will be very easy thing when a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone.if this happens, people can get guns easy. The existence of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns."
1659,I was surprised by this article. Of course these explosions are so terrible. And such incidents related to terrorism should be published all over the world.But I think there are other important information we should know. Our knowledge are controlled by such mass medias easily. Thus I think the mass medias should spread the journalism to make our knowledge wider.
1660,"It is unfair that Italy is only responsible for this accident . It is a problem of every country. I think that the biggest cause of this kind of accidents is the difference of wages between Europe and Africa. Also I think the unemployment rate and poverty of Africa are the reasons of this problem. To solve this problem fundamentally, wage differences between countries must be corrected. To achieve that, we should pay more attention on the UN or the Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly etc, and should make every effort to form international community where every people can live comfortably and happily."
1661,"I was surprised second times at this news. First, capsize of the boat occurs in the reality. I think it is the accident only in movie and comics. Second, the number of bodies which rescue workers recovered amazed me. Saving 111 lives is so wonderful thing!!!"
1662,"I strongly believes that the best way to prove this problem is that European countries and African countries corporate and work together. Maybe, the Africans who died in this accident was so called 'illegal immigrant.' Illegal immigration is a serious problem in many European countries. Also, it is not good for African countries that their people go foreign countries."
1663,"I was very surprised at contents of this news. I think the reason why immigration occur is that most African migrant did not satisfied with their life in Africa. Therefore, European countries should support African who endure poor life. Naturally, African countries have to effort to develop their economy."
1664,"This news made me realize hard facts of the situation in the developing world in our time. There are still many people who found themselves in difficulty in their home countries. For example, people are suffering from a food shortage, unfavorable terms of employment, or the spread of terrible diseases. Moreover, I have recently heard that some women who have moved to the developed world do not want to go back for the reason of the frequency of sex crimes over there. I think refugees should be accepted more because they have no choice but to move away to more comfortable countries to live. It is not right for us to blame them for escaping from their countries without trying to help them find happiness, just because entering other countries with no permission is illegal. It is natural that they have a right to have better lives like we do in Japan, isn't it? If you say that the number of migrants has to decrease, I think you should contribute to them get comfortable life. For example, you can start a fundraising campaign, or be a member of some kinds of NGO to support developing countries in supplying what they need and maintaining public order. If more people do so, thousands of migrants who may die making the journey to developed countries could be saved."
1665,"I was very surprised to read the news. I have a question that why the migrant boat caught fire. I think that if a boat sinks, I will die in an instant because I cannot swim. I really realized how wonderful rescue workers are and I think that things were better that many people were rescued."
1666,"The headline reminded me 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami because there are also still many missing people in the sea. However, there is a difference, too. While the earthquake couldn't have avoided by human, the sinking could have been prevented. The article said that this kind of accidents had been often happened before. Because of this, I hope the international community will take urgent action. The victims must have been looking to make a brighter future for themselves in Europe. I hope no more Africans will die on the way to Europe. I pray their soul may rest in peace."
1667,"It is difficult that solve a problem of refugee. Because Long as there is war and poverty in the world, refugee born. When does the war for resources, land, and ideology end? Or does it never go away? We shouldn't think that peace of Japan continue forever."
1668,"This accident is said to be the worst in a series of accidents that have occurred in the Mediterranean, so I was surprised when I heard this news. It is not only producing numerous victims, but highlighting the problem about illegal immigrant. The problem of illegal immigrant is a perplexing issue in the decision-making process of the EU, but the accident should be used as an opportunity to consider the problem of immigrant and I want the EU to approach a solution."
1669,"I was surprised to hear that.This accident is so devastating that I think there are no survivors.However,at least 155 people could be survived.This is because rescue workers did things which they should do This is good."
1670,"I was surprised to hear that. This accident is so devastating that I think there are no survivors. However,at least 155 people could be survived. This is because rescue workers did things which they should do. This is good."
1671,"I am very sorry for migrants' death in this accident. I am afraid but I've never heard that thousands of migrants have tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and have died many times. Regarding this accident, I wonder why people living in the island of Lampedusa didn't help the migrants on the burning boat, since it sank only half a mile from the shore. If they tried to help migrants, more people would have been rescued. Migrants escape from their home countries as they cannot live there stably because of internal conflicts, poverty and tyranny by their governments. However, for European countries, it is very difficult to accept all the migrants every year. I hope that African countries will have democratic governments and people could live happily in their home countries so that there will be no one who wants to escape by crossing the Mediterranean."
1672,"When I saw this news, I thought it's happened in Middle Ages. A TV program said in the past, slaves had carried to Europe using small boat. The Blacks were forced, very bad circumstance, there were no toilet, no space to sleep and no something to eat. Further, the boat sunk frequently. I think nothing is changed. We repeat same mistakes many times. We have to solve this issue. This issue is not only Italy's. I think developed country have to aid developing countries."
1673,"It's a pity thing that many African people died. To avoid such a tragedy, it's important to offer the good working places in Africa. Moving to the developed countries may cause the same thing someday again. I think developed countries should help the developing countries in Africa (of course, not only in Africa but also all over the world), and should treat them equal terms with the rich."
1674,"I think this problem is very difficult to solve.However,the government must be careful for the migrants to stop the accident like this.The migrants will be big power to solve working problem of nation. So,we treated them important,equal.We should accept them and exist together in the same society."
1675,I felt sad when I knew this news. Over 100 parsons were killed in this accident. A lot of Africans need job and want to move to Europe. This problem might lead to happen this devastating accident. I think European and African countries need to consider this accident and do some effort not to happen such a accident again.
1676,"When I read this article,I felt sad and was surprised.But I thought that there is not 100% safety in the real world.So,we need to reduce the possibility of happening terrible accident such as the accident appearing in this article.I want to praise the rescue workers who saved about 160 people and want them to carry out measures immediately."
1677,"I was surprised to hear the news and felt sad. The reason why the accident happened is the migrant worker problem, in my opinion. A lot of unemployed people in Africa often come to Europe illegally in order to get job. Each year swells the rank of the unemployed in the world. So European countries also have to accept the migrant with restraint to raise their own employment rate. I think this problem is not only European but also African problem. Of course, European governments make efforts to accept more migrant, however African governments should work hard to supply the more environment of a workplace. In short, both European and African countries have to solve this problem."
1678,"I think the most important aim of the voyages are to get jobs. A lot of Africans who don't have jobs go to Europe in order to get jobs. In order to solve this problem, the European countries and African countries should cooperate each other. For example,European enterprises advance into Africa and offer employment opportunity and African government should make safer society. In any case, to prevent the tragedy the international cooperation is essential"
1679,"I was very surprised by this news story because I didn't know this news. To begin with, I didn't know even that emigrant activity from Africa to Italy was carried out. I think that the African countries which produce many migrants without being able to feed the nation are responsible for this accident. It is a minimum duty as the countries to keep the life of the nation"
1680,"This news is too sad,tragedy. The migrants have done all the effort to get out from their plight but finally ended in vain.Tragedy after tragedy.Their effort was unrewarded. However there are nobody to blame on, I think.The accident may have been avoided but the situation was difficult to deal,difficult to predict,difficult to react immediately indeed.That makes me feel more and more complicated."
1681,"The accident was caused by the people made light of Africans. Clearly,we should take an action to realize the brighter future of them. At first, we should help them for example financially to live comfortably in their countries. And secondly, we mustn't desert all the people defecting to our countries."
1682,I was very surprised to hear this news. Because over 200 migrants were killed in this accident. I think the Council of Europe's parliamentary should make sincere effort to prevent similar accidents . And furthermore to solve the difference of wages between Europe and Africa is also necessary.
1683,"I was very surprised to see this news in last week's class because that I hadn't heard this news before. Unfortunately, we often hear this kind of tragedies around the world. I strongly agree with Jean-Claude Mignon's statement, which says about the improvement of all the situations. In addition, I want to claim that sailors, who actually take the handle of vessels should think of safety more. Of course, the governments should make some changes of system, but I think sailors themselves also hold problems."
1684,"When I heard this news,I was very surprised.Because I could not imagine such things.I think more and more people could be alive.If people made effort to protect from such things.So we should learn from such things."
1685,It is difficult that solve a problem.I think that this problem is not responsibility only for Italy.This incident is affected poverty in Africa.It is necessary for the global community to cooperate.And Japan should do more movement.
1686,"I became very sad when I read this article. In terms of law, it cannot be forgave that migrants were killed.Some problem,race and skin color, make people think that 'we' are not same with 'them' in spite of the fact that we are all human beings. In this case, these bias may have one responsibility to this tragedy.Although this problem might have been in for long time, we have mission to remove that bias."
1687,"The migrant went on their journey for getting the peace place, but their hope has come to an end such as tragedy. Any accident occurs without purpose and suddenly. So I think that the responsibility of this tragedy doesn't belong to Italy, European countries and any European organization. What they can do next is to learn a lesson from this and never to repeat such happenings, for example, keep the rescuers going into action as soon as possible."
1688,"I think if we pass over this problem of migrants,we would make repeated same mistakes.Now we must discuss what to do about it all over the world. This accident happened in Italy this time,but there is a possibility of happening in other countries.It is important that many countries have senses of impending crisis.What we can do for victims of the accidents is to learn from history,change the environment and solve the problem."
1689,"I think that Southern Europe countries should accept a refugee as much as possible. On the other hand, I think that not only to help a refugee but also to reduce the refugee through the support for Africa are required of developed countries."
1690,"I was very shocked when I heard the news. When I was a high school student, I knew the fact that some Africans went to Europe though they run risks in dying. The causes of the action are conflicts and the corruption of the government. So the UN should solve those problems."
1691,I was surprised to read this news. I cannot imagine such an awful thing. I hope people in Italy can live safely. Africa and Italy try to prevent accident like this and solve this problem. The governments should make effort to solve this accident and other accident like this.
1692,"I was surprised at this news. Because I think it is very scary to die to sink. A lot of people is sinking,now. I hope to be discovered. When I was at the age of 10, I went to sea. Of course I went into water, and played. I was drown. It was very scary."
1693,"I felt so sad to hear the news. Why those poor migrants couldn't make good journey though such tragedy could easily prevented? And why they had to be caught fire and capsized off? People all have equal rights. And even though they are poor, they have the freedom of journey and safety. And it mustn't exist to attack such poverty at any time."
1694,"I was surprised for me to read a report. It is because the correspondence to a refugee is severe. I think that a refugee is not lost unless war is lost. Is argument lost? I think that war is not lost by me. Because, people are since he wants profits. We must not pursue only our profits."
1695,"I think that government of Eritrea and Somalia are responsible for this tragedy. In stable government,people will not migrate abroad. Eritreans and Somalis can't help migrating to Europa with dangerously overcrowded and unseaworthy vessels . Because they hope to live in peace area. We can do nothing about this problem until immigrants go through the border between Africa and Europa. This tragedy is difficult to be stamped out."
1696,Immigrant from Africa to Europe has caused my arguments.Many immigrants come to Europe risking their life.In order to make these problems not happen we need to make Africa richer so that Africans won't have to risk their lives to make a living. International cooperation is indispensable in order to solve this issue.
1697,This was a terrible accident.I think governments of Eritrea and Somalia should try to reduce the number of people who migrate from these countries.The reason why so many people try to migrate is the bad condition of their own country. So I think the government of Eritrea and Somalia should try to improve their own country.
1698,We are poor to solve such a racial problem because Japan has only one race. (There are the Ainus and Ryukyuan to be exact.) So I usually think it is bad to come foreign country to work for migrants. But every country isn't peaceful and rich. So every migrant doesn't want to work foreign country. It is so difficult for human being to solve an international problem. But we never get really peaceful without solving an international problem.
1699,"I was very sad to hear the news because this accident may be kept.I heard that Italian ship came there and went away. This means that this accident should be defended by that ship. I am sorry for hundreds of migrant but i also think this voyage is very high risk and dangerous.So they should think more about the situation and change some systems.For example, to ban the migrant people but it is very difficult…"
1700,"I was surprised to ad this news, because I didn't know that such a tragedy often happen. I think migrants make a dangerous because they can't make a living if they do not so and have not enough money to ride a good ship. So, I think surrounded countries should offer help to them."
1701,"Of course I think drone should not be used. There are three reasons for that. First, I think the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. Users of drones do not have to go to the field of war and can live everyday lives after their work. Second, I think that people can trigger wars easily if drones are used because no people of one's own country would die. Third, because of inaccuracy of drones , many civilians are killed indiscriminately. To decrease the use of drones, I think that America must cooperate because America have so many drones. To attain that, UN should try to regulate the power of America in the UN. If that can be achieved, situations may be improved somewhat."
1702,"I have read this article, I remembered the Nintendo War. To kill a lot of people, using missiles feels a guilty feeling less than to kill a human with knife. It would give us a little guilty to kill people even by using unmanned aircraft. Even more it is absurd that citizens became victims. I don't believe in peace which is brought by military power."
1703,"Long as there is an issue of rich and poor, migrant workers will not disappear. Worker is treated like a machine. They get the money instead of life. Managers want only profit, and forget that workers are human. We should notice something important than profit."
1704,"I think drone strikes is the epoch-making method to kill the people, exactly. Because the company can alive by using this method even when we kill a lot of people. So, I understand that the Obama administration escalated the use of it little bit."
1705,"I agree your opinion. At first, I thought that migrants are pitied. But, we should not think that the plight of migrants is out of the question. Japan may possibly go bankrupt in a few years. We have to be very much aware of the world situation."
1706,"When I reading the news, I remember the Jewish asylum. Being forced to work in up to 50°C heat, with little water and no air-conditioning in the home is the very life of a slave. It's a pure anachronism. Because we live in affluent circumstances, we tend to think that starvation and the death of fatigue is virtual thing. But, the benefits of the Industrial Revolution are not given to every people."
1707,"I think it is difficult to decide which is justice about this problem. Drone strikes,UAVs, is the methods the U.S have used in order to counter terrorism.It is not easy for them to replace it by using other means.This problem will be debatable for along time."
1708,"I was surprised at the news. I think that the drone strike is very dangerous weapon. By using drone strikes, many people are killed without difficulty. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It is so far to come the peaceful world."
1709,"I was surprised at the case that many citizens has become victim to drone strikes. The report said 'Drones can reduce the damage of citizens depending on how.', as long as victims of more than 400 people have come up to now, there is no difference to be dangerous. At the same time, a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. Therefore, we should be considered how to make useful citizens, instead of hurting the citizen."
1710,"When I heard this news, I think there is luck of press freedom. Qatar government said 'Number of dead is exaggerated.'and denied media reports of labor situation, as long as taking their toll, I think getting attach to the number is crazy. Qatar government accepts this case as read seriously and should take a proactive stance on problems in labor environment. Otherwise Qatar is not said the nation fit to host FIFA World Cup."
1711,"Is the use of drone strikes good for peace? When I read this article, such question crossed my mind. Before, my answer to this question was absolutely 'No' because I didn't think that killing people was the best way to maintain public order. Then, I got confused because I could kind of understand the US argument, reading the article. However, I still have the same answer. We shouldn't use drone strikes so much. I think drone strikes can promote war because they are unmanned weapons. Such weapons may lighten the guilty feeling. Of course, to punish radical terrorist, it sometimes needs to use such weapons, but it had a risk of involving innocent people. That's why I think we should refrain from using drone strikes."
1712,"Many people look forward to 2022 FIFA World Cup.However, it should not be held by immolating Nepalese labourers.FIFA World Cup and The Olympics are often called as the symbol of peace and friendship.But,they may be only the festival of money basically.We should think 'Which is more important,the fun of sports or the life of labourers?' Of course,the answer is clear."
1713,"When I read this news, I remember Three Laws of Robotics.This law tells 'A robot may not harm a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.' Actually,many people think this law is a fancy.To sum up, a robot can not keep this rule.If we use drone and UAVs,we must be careful about not be out of control."
1714,"I was shocked by reading the following passage. It is said that Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004. Up to 2200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 civilians. Knowing this fact, I do not think drone strikes should be accepted for now. It is because so many innocent people have been killed due to the strikes. I know that they are necessary for Americans to prevent terrorism, but I feel that they should think other ways unless remotely piloted aircraft are dangerous. Other than that, the American government would be able to use those improved enough to handle safely. For example, American forces can operate some sort of system that predicts unusual situation to prevent attacks scientifically. If science develops more, I believe it could be done."
1715,"Nepalese workers came to Qatar to earn their families' living, so I think it is inevitable that they suffer from bad conditions. I would predict that many Nepalese people are living in poor surrounding in their home countries as well, and it is not good for them to send back to Nepal either. In order to solve this problem, I think NGOs or some sort of international organizations should help Nepalese get better life in their country."
1716,Americans love to be a 'hero' but they need to think about what 'justice' they are fighting for.
1717,"I don't understand why people suffering from serious poverty give births even though it is obvious that their children are going to suffer, too. Relatively rich countries such as European countries cannot afford to save overflowing poor people. When I was in Finland two years ago, the same issue was in crisis. ( And I'm sure it still is.) My host-mother told me that poor immigrants do not work not only because they don't have skills that is needed to work, but also they are lazy. I think they are not used to work before, so they cannot work stably in the same place."
1718,"I think that using drone have both negative point and positive point. First, negative point is guilty conscience. Of course, murder is heavy crime, so people who remote control drone do not kill others directly. As a result, they do not feel guilty conscience. Second, positive point is the number of casualties. Drone is unmanned vehicle. Therefore, if drone was broken, nobody died. In conclusion, I agreed using drone in order to counter terrorism, because it makes the number of casualties decrease."
1719,"I am sad to read the article. One of the important purposes of the international sports meet is to promote mutual friendship between the countries, I think. Of course the World Cup is not an exception. So the fact that many people are dying behind that purpose is so ironic. To solve the problem, the transparency of the process of the construction should be released and if needed, the other countries should cooperate to improve the work environment."
1720,"was surprised to hear the news. I didn't think of those plight that many people dye because of the world cup.The anticipated number of people who dye until 2020 is also shocking.The number shows how the environment of the workers is horrible.Every time we hear of a big event(like world cup ) hosted in developing country(like Qatar) maybe we should imagine that there will be a huge number of people who work in a plight,just like this case."
1721,I really feel frustrated every time I hear of a
1722,"I feel really frustrated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military.And that's one of my greatest conscious. Well well indeed ,those drones and other military technology shows the nation's power and how great the US is.But that's all.The US haven't gained any other power to solve international issues.The US haven't changed since 9.11 .US should search other way to show the strength of the US."
1723,"I think this problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. The one thinks it is the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives and safety, the other thinks using the drones is only to protect the country and civilians so stopping using them can't allow. It is difficult to use them with no victims. the happening without intentionally can not be avoided. We should find the point of compromise between 'military' and 'civilian safety'."
1724,"When I read this article, I was very shock. I didn't know that UAV has been made and killed a lot of civilians already. I had thought such a vehicle is not made for a long time. I oppose using such an UAV. Surely the pilots who died by a battle will decrease. However citizen dies as ever, and war will become easy to happen. So I can't agree to it."
1725,"Even if the strike is safer than traditional methods,actually,it made civilian casualties.So the Obama administration can't say it is one of means to counter terrorism.The strike causes damage to citizen and it isn't effective in protecting them.The violence produces the violence again and it is vicious cycle. I think the best way to solve the problem of terrorism is discussion,but it is true that this method is difficult.So America should offer information people need at least.The lack of transparency makes people uneasiness."
1726,"The problem of labor circumstances should be shown and other countries should recognize it.Such a problem is difficult to be seen by others.Qatar may take an action to it by the criticism from all over the world. In the first place,World Cup is the event that all people enjoy joining.The player and the spectator don't want to think that the labors die because of it and the family of victim would be sad every year of Would Cup.All labors must be treated as a person who has human rights."
1727,"I don't agree with the use of drone strikes. There are two reasons. First, the drone have the lack of judgement. In my opinion, the machine won't judge who are a non-combatant exactly even if it is difficult for human to judge exactly. So the drone will not keep the international law. As a result, a lot of non-combats may be killed at random by drone. Second, the drone cannot be immune to breakdown. Drone is machine, and nobody knows the time when the machine is out of order. So the drone should not be used."
1728,"It's inevitable to happen some tragedy in the world, but I'm so sorry about this time because the case could easily have been prevented. we are living peacefully in Japan, and actually have nothing with people in Africa, so we can live without caring about them. But, the world is becoming more and more global, and we can do very many things we couldn't imagine to do twenty years ago. So I believe that we can even solve the situation in Africa if people in the world cooperate one another to help them. Furthermore, I'm highly expect that the world will continue to progress and make something impossible possible including solving the situation in Africa."
1729,"I was surprised and terrified by reading this article.America uses the drone strikes under the pretext of counter-terrorism.But actually they use it to make their profit,for instance economical profit.In spite of this situation,more and more American ordinary people lend their hands to the government to do the drone strike.I think they did it like playing game because they cannot see the situation which is attacked by drone strike.In addition,it is so difficult to have sufficient evidence.I think if we do not touch the problem,only America makes their profit and the number of civilian casualties will increase.So,I do not agree with the use of drone strikes and we need measures to deal with the situation soon."
1730,"I'm living peacefully in Japan thinking like no more danger to be involved in some war. I consider the world war two last big one for us, because people in the world experienced the worst tragedy ever. But it doesn't seem to be true. It's possible to happen some tragedy again, actually terrible things are still on in the other part of world, though I haven't experienced but only watched them on TV. We must learn from the past and mustn't repeat mistakes by cooperating one another all around the world. I hope that nowadays' great technology of human such as drone will be used with proper way and the world will be changed better without wars."
1731,"This is so difficult problem. Certainly, it's important to attack without risk of attacker, but it's limited only if attacker is absolute justice. But, there are not such as absolute justice. US and terrorist have a reason to attack somebody. Of course terrorist's reason is unacceptable. I think US is attacking to help civilian, but if they're killing innocent, it's same as terrorism. If drone strike kill many civilian, US have to stop attacks by UAVs. However if US do nothing to these country, many civilians will be killed by terrorist. My opinion, US drone strike is not guilty, but it must stop, and many country (not only US) have to think and act about this problem."
1732,"Even if whatever reasons there is, I think, we should not injure or hurt other people. Drone strikes can injure people easily. The people attack need not go to the front. Of course, I oppose that going to the front and attacking. I hope there would be no arms all over the world."
1733,"The tournament would not be 'built on the blood of innocents'. I think it is correct. The purpose of the World Cup is not only watching heated games, but also making contribution to the development of the host country. For Qatar, hosting the World Cup is effective in economy. And a lot of profits can be gained. However,in the process of the World Cup (for example making infrastructures) , worker's right should be saved."
1734,"I'm afraid that attacks to people steadily escalate because drone strikes are very 'effective' to kill a lot of people. We can do that very easily by drone,if we hope.It's very awful circumstance. According to the article,in the world,2200 people have been killed. This number was made by that 'easiness',I believe. I hope humans stop to pursue it,noticing its awfulness."
1735,I am against to use drones. It is so easy to kill people and the consciousness of killing people is so week when you use drones. It is so terrible that one can kill people without conscience even if casualties are terrorist. I hope the drones will be abolished
1736,"I wonder for what to ignore the problem of workers leading to death by overwork many, to hold the Olympic Games.The government must improve the working environment.And, I think that we should consider the human rights of human beings.Without regard to human rights, I am against the Olympic Games to be held."
1737,"When I read this article for the first time, I was only opposed to the drone strikes and Obama's policy. But after reading your opinion that mentions other good way to use drones, I couldn't help changing my opinion that oppose drones perfectly. But it is natural that the latest skills are always used to injure people. They must understand better way to use such skills."
1738,"It's difficult problem. If a weapon becomes unmanned the dead people of the friend soldier decrease.However, more citizens will die of it. Because as a result, weapons increase.US become in danger to keep peace.I have a doubt to keep peace whether such many weapons are necessary."
1739,"I felt anger with such dangerous weapons and Obama's escalating. Of course such skills are useful and epoch-making. So we can find better way to use them, for example, to make them work in dangerous places like atomic power plants. If we think others each other, we can prevent accidents easily."
1740,"I think this problem is odd. To begin with,I can't understand why many countries permit foreign country's attack.A state have sovereignty. I feel drone's attack infringe sovereignty. But America justify drone's attack by insisting 'world police'. I will not grant the present situation that we can't help depending on America's army power."
1741,"I don't oppose the use of unmanned aircraft. This is because riding a bomber plane long time is dangerous for the pilot. But in this matter,I think the United States is wrong. Whatever reason there is, killing civilians is not allowed absolutely. Drone strike may reduce sacrifice of American soldiers, but the operation should be carried out very carefully."
1742,"Of course,I think the drone must not be used. However, if the war continue, drone might be used because by using drones can save lives of offense side country's soldiers. The war kills both sides people, but they hope nobody get hurt. In order to stop using drones, we must end the war."
1743,"Drone strikes is a weapon to kill a lot of people. This weapon is too dangerous to use. However,drone strikes has many way to be used. People should consider how to use it. Drone strikes can be a device to help people, but it can be also a weapon."
1744,"The way of US sometimes kills a lot of innocent people. Drone can be the tragedy like Iraq War , but if this incident can be justified or not is uncertain. I think this should be carefully watched."
1745,"In Europe , many people from a lot of area live together. Spanish living in Italy , the French living in Russia is an everyday affair. Therefore , this kind of thing can be happened often. I think this kind of problem is difficult to solve."
1746,"I think drone strikes had better not be used. But it is an ideal. They are very strong and safe for user. Because pilot is not necessary. So people will use them if government deny them. I think government should limit the size of them or amount of explosive. If do it, damage will be small!!"
1747,I think it is a very serious problem. Other countries which hold the Olympic Games and the World Cup would do the same thing. It is because they have to build stadiums though they don't have enough time. So they tend to force migrant workers to work harshly.
1748,"I think American's mention is selfish and not reasonable. In fact, considering of casualty, they don't see the real that are caused by UAVs in drone strikes. In addition, they should recognize that their action violate international humanitarian law. If they think it should be America that lead the world, they have to think what is real safe."
1749,"I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they save a lot of soldiers' life. If the USA throw soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply."
1750,"I was surprised for me to read this report. Many people are dead when A attacks. And the civilian is also dead. The side which surely is attacked is safe. However, the side attacked is dangerous. A will surely be used more. The civilian must be made not to be attacked."
1751,"USA has played a important role in the international power relationship. The overwhelming military power has allowed US to do that, and yet that overwhelming monopoly of military power has caused controversy in all times. Drones may be discussed as a issue now, but as time goes by the argument will vanish and fade away."
1752,"I was very surprised to read this article, also I was sad. I do not think USA should use drone strikes any more. Many innocent people have died because of the bomb. I strongly believe that we cannot end war by using such dangerous weapons."
1753,I was surprised at this news. This problem is not simple and there is no best answer for everyone. I think it's the most important to guarantee the civilian's lives. I also think that why a side that drop bombs on a country that is another side does not talk a matter out with another side before dropping bombs. It's so far to come the peaceful world.
1754,"I think escalated the use of drone strikes is not acceptable.I have a reason for this. The reasons is that using drones don't make the users of them feel guilty, because the users don't have to go to the killing fields by themselves. Because of the reason, I'm against the use of drones."
1755,"I agree to the contents of the first paragraph. It may be necessary by any chance. However,the authorities must not injure an innocent citizen and will lose trust if they do such a thing. They will regret that they judge decision to make harm on people. I can not understand the reason why they want to use drone strikes for by all means. And, I think the people objecting to the dangerous policy of the authorities should insist more."
1756,"Such perilous conditions is sad news for me because I think the FIFA World Cup should be entertainment for everyone. However, at the same time, I am ashamed of having fun watching the game without knowing such bad conditions. I don't want 4,000 people to die before the 2022 FIFA World Cup. I hope the Qatari Government will immediately support workers who went there to work and send money back to their poor families."
1757,I was surprised to hear the news.The brain uses sleep to wash up the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking.This is very important findings.I think please continue to research the brain and sleep.
1758,"America says drones are used to counter terrorism, but I think there is a paradox. Drone strikes made so many casualties in the world. Innocent civilians having been killed generates grudge and hate against America. This cause to grow up expected terrorists.You should think about what you deal with.Though drone have no life,there are many lives and human's emotion in the attacked area.I disagree the drone which makes negative feelings in peoples mind and new terrorists."
1759,"After reading this article, I realized that sleep plays an important role for us to live. I didn't know that Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease is related to sleep, so I was surprised to know this fact. It means that if we don't get enough sleep, it will increase the risk of diseases. So I think I need to change my sleeping pattern because I don't sleep well these days."
1760,I agree with ID1323'opinion. Sleeping pattern is related to diseases. This surprised me.I have to change it.
1761,"Although I knew a little that sleep is necessary for the brain to arrange information people have, I was surprised to know that sleep washes away the waste toxins in the brain. If this cleaning mechanism of brain is studied more and something would be discovered, diseases such as Alzheimer or Parkinson may be cured. It is true that the brain controls almost all the human, so studying of brain should be encouraged more. However, science and technology must not be abused. To achieve this, education in science and ethics should be emphasized. I hope that technological development contribute to the happiness of people."
1762,"I learned that the sleeping is so important through this article. In fact, I don't have enough time of sleep. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep because of meeting. The day before yesterday, I went to bed at 3 o'clock and wake up 6'oclock. I have a sense of crisis to not only skin but also brain."
1763,"Reading this article, I was not very surprised and was relieved because I already have had my pattern of sleep.Basically I sleep at 12 and get up at 6.However I was very surprised at some part of the story.The vital function does not appear while the mind is awake.By the lack of sleep,the toxin proteins may accumulate in our brain.The build up will lead us to many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.Because these risk are lurking, I hope that the study will be more advanced. At the same time,I thought I should be careful not to break my sleep pattern."
1764,I'm happy to read this news as this article justifies my idle slumber.
1765,"The US is often said to be 'the world's policeman,' but by wiretapping, the US lost the trust by Merkel and other people. What is the real reason to wiretap? Is that really needed? Two years ago, the US demanded Japan to help wiretap. However, Japan didn't accept the request. I think a lot of people somehow had known the wiretapping by the US. The truth the US was wiretapping was just happened to be revealed."
1766,"I usually sleep for 7 hours and I often said it is enough, but for me, it's not enough. It is often said that sleeping is good for our health and I think so, too. However, I didn't know that sleep cleans the brain. At first, I didn't have the idea that there are damaged proteins in the brain. Maybe I have less damaged proteins than other people. I read this news and I thought I should sleep for 7 hours."
1767,"This article is so useful for me. I have not known about function of the brain until now, but I have believed sleep is very important action for us and taken a sleep enough time. Therefore, I could reconfirm importance of sleep. I would like to cherish sleep."
1768,This article make me feel sad. A lot of migrant labour work so hard to build infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup. I doubt whether World Cup which cause many migrant labour die is really important. I think the place held World Cup should be changed.
1769,"I think that spying is unpleasant action. Nobody want to be bugged private talking by another person so spying violate privacy. Even if the US protect own country against terrorism, spying is not best way. It is because spying might involve unrelated person."
1770,"I have never heard the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. Now, I understand why I have a poor memory. My brain cannot wash the brain enough because of my short sleep, and there might be a lot of toxins. Anyway, this is just a joke. I know it is the only excuse for me because I am supposed to take enough sleeping hours. So, I have poor memory by nature. However, if it work effectively, I will use sleeping time more importantly."
1771,"I realize the importance of sleep. Of course, I have heard that sleep is important for our health. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. I did not know Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are related to brain cells, either. I would like to take enough sleep in order to my health."
1772,"I was very surprised to hear that.Trade unionists and human rights campaigners have forced the world to recognize the plight of Nepalese labourers in Qatar, who have to work 'like slaves'.This is not good thing. This country have to change the way."
1773,"I was surprised to hear that. The U.S use spying to counter terrorism. However,this violates human rights. Although The U.S protect own nation,there is other way except for spying. The U.S should change the way to other way."
1774,"I do not think that the arguments about drones will vanish and fade away. The reason is that I think that in the future, the number of drones will be increased and almost all the wars will be occurred by using drones because of the development of the science. I think that drones make war easy thing and bring less guilty feeling to the operates. Therefore, many more drones in the future must emphasize these negative points more than now."
1775,"Although I knew that sleep is good for we are in good health, I was surprised that there is a role to get rid of harmful toxins that sleep produces in the brain. I also thought and It looks there are many that the functions and mechanisms of the brain has not been elucidated yet. That's why I think the brain is a place that is hidden a lot of potential. And taking a good quality sleep for the brain is essential. I cannot help but make light of taking sleep, but I thought I should make much of taking sleep all the same."
1776,"I think it is amazing that scientists have found that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. As they suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, it means that they would be cured if science in technology advances more, like ID1328 says. In addition to that, I am expecting scientists to find the way to cure insomnia, because it is also well-known that a kind of sleeping disorder causes insomnia. When it comes to myself, I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes after going to bed, and it is the best time in a day that I truly feel comfortable. For purpose of this, I do not understand why some people have trouble sleeping, and I feel sorry for them as they cannot know the happiness of sleeping. To solve this problem, I would like scientists to study the mechanism of sleeping more."
1777,"I agree with ID1301. I think the US should operate other ways to counter terrorism without spying because it will destroy relationships with other countries. As Angela Merkel says, it is not fair that the US only spy other countries, when others not. In the world today, the US is the most powerful and influential country in economically and politically, it should not be right that the US are lost faith in it by them. In the passage, it is also written that spying is needed for commercial and business reasons, but I doubt that they are the right reasons for it. One way to avoid spying that I can think of is that the US has a stronger bond with other countries in militarily and commercially. It is of course difficult, but that could be the best way"
1778,I was surprised at the news because I did not know that the brain worked so hard during I was sleeping. I wonder when the brain takes a rest if it works all the time. I think it may possibly work all the time. I understand a brain plays an important role as far as we live.
1779,"After I read this article, I thought that Japan is in crisis more than German. Because Japan has no law which Spanish spying. To defeat this situation, present Prime Minister Shinzo Abe suggests that Japan make NSC, an institution which protect secret information. However, I think that this institution may lead to violation of constitution. A right to know may not be assured. Therefore, I think Mr.Abe must consider carefully about how to use it when he make such system."
1780,"I think sleep is necessary for human to live healthfully.I knew that sleep is important,but I often stayed up late when I wanted to watch TV,play games and do my homework.Actually,I usually regret that I didn't sleep enough because the next day,I can't wake up early and I am sleepy all day.So I decided to sleep as long as possible especially when I have exams.I should study beforehand otherwise I can't clean toxins and memorize something new.I keep this article in mind to use my brain in a best condition in the exams."
1781,"I could know by this news that Sleep is necessary for our lives.However, I sometimes stay up late or sleep for short time.According to this news, my body may have a lot of toxins.Besides, short sleeping leads to illness such as Alzheimer and Parkinson.I afraid of it. So, I want to have enough sleep from now on."
1782,"Now,Drones is used some countries.A few days ago, China's army said if the Self-Defense Forces shoots down the drones of China,China will attack Japan.Drones has no people and don't catch by radar, so they can invade other country easily.I think Drone strikes should be limited,because they sometimes be causes of war.Terrorism should be prevented by other ways."
1783,"It puzzles me that the US did such a foolish activity. It leads to the US's loss of trust with a lot of countries. It never gives any profit to the US. To be honest, I wouldn't be surprised if the US spied on China or Russia. It is because they are imaginary enemies for the United States. However, it spied on Germany. Germany is a alliance to the US. Its spying activity is very disrespect."
1784,"I have thought that the brain don't sleep any time. So, I was surprised when I red this article and I knew the system of the brain. And I was happy to know it. I want to know about the brain more."
1785,"This news made me very happy. It is because the news justified my sleep. I want to sleep more! From now on, if I late for class, I will excuse myself for coming late ''It was because my brain washed away the waste toxins!'' It would make teachers angry, however."
1786,"Whenever the test term, I try to sleep at least 3 hours, because I believe sleep organize memory in the brain and I can't get a good score without sleep. In this news, if we can't get a sleep, our brain ware damaged by toxin. So we have to sleep not only to organize memory but also to protect our brain from poison. This is good reason to explain to my parents 'why I'm always sleeping until noon at holiday.' Anyhow I have learned sleep is important! But I have a night shift today!! haha! I want to sleep...umm.."
1787,"I do agree that the US needs to lead the world to fight terrorism. In order to realize it,research or investigation in other country is necessary. The problem is that The US done that without other county's permission,in other word,'spy'.This action of the US may lead the world to chaos and prevent the world from cooperating against terrorism. I always doubt the way the US fight terrorism.They always harm themselves by themselves."
1788,"Well, I didn't know that! I did recognize the importance of sleep but I didn't know the flood wash up my brain during sleep to wash away poisons(however it is uncertain how much this new discovery is reliable). This means if you keep awake for a long time and never sleep. your brain will go bad , or maybe get rotten by the poison! That's awful. I'd better sleep more, maybe during class. HAHA just kidding==="
1789,"I felt the importance of sleeping.I knew that it is useful to fix the memory.However,I don't know this effect of sleeping.Then,I make up my mind to sleep longer for my health.Of course, it is important to stay up in class,too."
1790,"The more studying come out, the more importance of sleep we get to know, I felt this when I read this article. And, it's possible that much knowledge on sleep hasn't found yet, so I'm thinking to take my sleep more seriously, because the students at universities tend to like not to sleep and play at bar, karaoke room or something like that. I heard that it's difficult for sophomore to attend even second period lesson. It must be very easy and usual when they are high school students and before then. We are already next to workers, so should have awareness as an adult and take care of ourselves with knowledge and some device."
1791,"I was so surprised to hear the news and this news makes me sad if this news is true. Of course, I knew the sleeping have a big role in fixing memories,however I don't know it may have another important role in brain such as removal system. The removal system should be needed for human health in my opinion, and so I have to make up my mind to keep more sleeping time because I don't have enough time to sleep every day. I hope this study will contribute to the diseases which have not been solved."
1792,"I felt sad to read this article. The world cup is what originally bring us peace and happiness, but it's actually leading many tragedies. I believe that people in the present time can use the greatest technology ever and help one another in the world if we try, so we should do them. I want our country Japan to be one of leaders to achieve them, and hopefully, I do want to make a contribution to it in the future. To make it true, I must study much including English, experience a lot and think carefully and widely."
1793,"I think it's silly of America to having done like that because it's very risky and it would be very serious if it is discovered. We have to cooperate with other countries to maximize human potential now, but America's action this time brought distrust in the world. Of course, to build counter-terrorism strategy is necessary for people on the earth, but I believe that there is otherwise, and America should take a different direction for it by taking advantage of this matter."
1794,"When I read this article, I was very interested because I take a lot of sleep every day but I didn't know the reason why people always become sleepy, so I have wanted to know a system of sleep until now. To know about this research in the article made my happy, because I take a lot of a sleep. So my brain may be very clean."
1795,"I don't agree with the US. The US do the spying in order to counter the terrorism. Spying is one of the most important thing to counter terrorism. However, the terrorism is not exactly defined in the world, and so different countries have different concepts of terrorism. Even if the US do the spying such as NSA's tapping the Merkel's phone in order to do that, the other countries could not consider it countering terrorism. If the US's action is permitted, the US can do anything on the plea of countering terrorism and any countries cannot stop the US. Through this accident,the US may take more independent action, in my opinion. Therefore I feel dangerous and I agree with European countries reaction."
1796,"After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleeping can wash away the waste toxins built up during my hard day's thinking… In these days, I often go to bed at 2am and wake up at 7am. It's not enough sleep for me, so I have to try to go to bed earlier than now!"
1797,"When I read this, I understood this view and thought,too. Of course, everyone knows sleep is important. But we understood it vaguely. In my opinion, many students in Japan tend to stay up late and always feel sleepy. So there are a lot of short sleeper! For example, I took little sleep, about 3hours, recently. Probably with this effect, I feel very bad and keep having headache. Short sleep makes my health bad surely. I realized again good sleep make good health."
1798,"I felt that too! If the sleeping is the correct thing for our health, why it must be banned to sleep at any time! Of course it may not be a good thing to sleep when or where we shouldn't sleep,for example in the daytime or during the class. But if it is our body's reaction to keep us healthy, I think it may not be great to be scolded in such situation. Even if it is idle, it may be nice if we take care of our health."
1799,"After I read about the news, I felt the importance of sleeping because I had thought the time I sleep is useless and I can use it for better thing if I had a little stronger mind. And I'm trying to begin to take a new habit to get enough sleep. I want to continue the habit not to get diseases in the future."
1800,"Until reading this article, I did not know the meaning of sleep well. I thought it's only putting the memory in order. So I thought that the shorter we sleep,the better our life is. But reading this article and learning about waste removal system', I began to think sleep is very important. From now on, I want to get more sleep for health. Although right now is the middle of the night ... ..."
1801,"I thought there was the sleep to rest ,but it is not true. We use the sleep to wash up the wast toxin, and memorize. When people have a lot of homework, they don't sleep. But it is very bad!! Because they memorize to sleep. We have to sleep to memorize!!"
1802,"I read the report and sympathized. I also think that sleep is important. Unless we go to sleep, energy does not come out of them. And sleep is required in order to wash an unnecessary toxin. To be sure, sleep is required although we cannot do it at all during sleep. I would like to sleep firmly from now on."
1803,I know that a brain needs to sleep to put memories in order. But facilities of sleep for brain this article said are new to me. My environment of sleep is so bad. I often sleep without noticing it. I sleep not on the bed but on the floor keeping the television turning on and keeping the light switching on. So I think that I don't receive the benefit of sleep very well. I may be Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in the future. I fell I must improve my sleep habit.
1804,"I agree his opinion. The contents of Three Laws of Robotics is so important. A robot is made by humans. So, robot should be benefit to humans. Why people made UAVs? UAVs are weapons to kill people. It's contradiction. Humans make a robot to kill humans."
1805,"After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. Lack of sleep hurts these cognitive processes in many ways. It impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently.I would like to go to bed airier from today."
1806,"I have known that sleep is essential to live, but I have not known that reason. I read vital function don't appear to be possible while the mind is awake, I am convinced why we need sleep. When I was a high school student, as summer homework, , I looked over materials about sleep and felt sleep is very interesting field. And,sleep is concerned with not only Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but also lifestyle-related diseases and depression. I want research about sleep advanced."
1807,To sleep cleans the brain of toxins is very interesting. Sleep is still important for human healthy. There is some more secret of the human functions. I think that to solve the human functions as difficult as to solve the universal secret.
1808,"To recover the broken trust between individuals is very difficult. Let alone to recover the broken trust between countries is more difficult. I don't know why America wiretapping, Germany ought to feel bad. America must make a sincere response to Germany."
1809,"I agree with your opinion. The US should change the way to other way. If America wants to true peace, America should make true relationship. It is not like wiretapping."
1810,I agree with your opinion. The power of sport can be made world peace. But victims for sports are not allowed. Such a sport does not make sense.
1811,"I was not surprised at this news. In my image, the spy is natural in USA. In the America, Hollywood stars have not privacy because of paparazzi. So, American people seem to be able to get other's private information easily."
1812,"Reading this article, I had goose-flesh because of terror. Such situation may cause loss of mutual trust and conflict between countries. If the problem gets worse, it may also have a risk to touch off war. In my opinion, even though he had assured Merkel that the United States 'is not monitoring and will not monitor' her communications, Obama should have taken more care about the information management because another news items reported that Obama said he hadn't know about the such NSA's action like a spy. I hope there will be no more such confliction."
1813,It is very surprising to me that sleep actually cleans the brain of toxins with fluid. I think we can someday strengthen our ability of memorizing and realize the health of the brain by sleeping well of course and studying the elements of the fluid and so on.
1814,"When I heard this news,I was very surprised.Because the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins.I think such problem with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to the diseases."
1815,Many people look forward to hording FIFA World Cup in 2022.But I think it should not be held by people who work in serious environment.Preferably other country should send on a voluntary assistance.I think course on the way not only the results but is also very important.
1816,"I understand the US claim that NSA's spying is a necessary part of their counter-terrorism strategy around world.But I think this way produce a vicious cycle and distrust between US and other country.If the US has a sense of responsibility for world peace,they should take steps that don't lose the credit."
1817,"What Taro Yamaoto did is said to break taboo and I think so, too. I think the position of emperor is quite neutrality. They are neither ordinary people nor politicians. I learned emperor is a symbol of Japan. However, Emperor Akihito may have known the current situation even if not said by Yamamoto. Because he seems always to concern people in Tohoku. Mr.Yamamoto should not have done such thing or he needed not do such thing."
1818,"The counter-terrorism is very important problem for US. However, this way makes bad feeling all over the world.From now on,international relations become more important for counter-terrorism strategy.The enemies are the terrorists but not the other countries."
1819,I agree with this article. We think about the risk of another tsunami or typhoon. Otherwise Japan will be dead nation.
1820,"I think that Taro Yamamoto should resign from the Diet, too. Political utilization of emperor is a prohibited action. This is the rule. I don't understand why he cannot the letter to the emperor, but I understand 'the lawmaker' should keep the rule."
1821,"I was surprised to read this article not only because details but also America's attitude. I felt German's claim was reasonable and America's deed was unreliable. Why is USA without showing embarrassment? If America is done same thing they did, they are surely be angry, I think. I guess that they think that acknowledge own fault is risky. But I think if they hope for safety and peace world and smooth diplomacy, they should feel shame at own behaves and apologize to German. And I think if USA doesn't apologize, another country can do same thing, so, now, I desire America acknowledge it's misdeed."
1822,"I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand the feeling that he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. However, what he did was overly rash. Many people should felt he did not has good sense and didn't know his place on account of his poor deed. If he is a honest Diet member, it is natural that he knows well the way of the Emperor for the Japanese citizen. What he did can not only shake a neutral viewpoint of the Emperor, but also put forward doubts about character of Japanese politicians. He should consider a little more before act and, aware of the influence of his action as the Diet member. I think such a case does not happen any more."
1823,"I was surprised and felt sad when I read this article. It is regret that the event everybody should enjoy is realized on sacrifice. I think that such a case happened in various countries so far. However, I thought that such a tragedy should have disappeared as the years go by. Something like worker association and labor standards supervision place starts and longs that the labor circumstances of people is kept. In addition, I think that other countries should help with the establishment, if necessary. I hope that something like worker association and labor standards supervision place starts and a working condition is protected by them. In addition, I think that other countries should help with the establishment , if necessary ."
1824,"Environmental pollution problems caused by nuclear weapons and war is serious in the world. Japanese released radioactivity, which is 300 times the atomic bomb, into the atmosphere and ocean. Japanese have to recognize the importance of this issue."
1825,I agree with your opinion. I think that Taro Yamamoto should consider the risk which political utilization of emperor. Because Japan separate politics and an emperor by reflect on the war.
1826,"I have not known about function of the brain during sleep. I learn function of the brain by reading this news. Sleeping is very important for us. These days, young people cannot sleep enough. I hope that this news is known by many people in the world. Sleeping is good for ourself."
1827,"I think that Japanese government should abolish all nuclear plants. However, they should not be abolished immediately because of influence of our life. Therefore the government must take the surest safety measures until all nuclear plants are abolished."
1828,"Taro Yamamoto should have acted more discreetly because it would have involved the emperor in politics. However, I kind of understand what he wanted to do because he might tried to change the situation. Honestly, I also have little hope for the Japanese Government because it's been a long time since Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster happened but it hasn't seem to have end of the trouble. After I read the article mentioned above, my thought had a little change because it said that the US and Japan would play a role in the cleanup operation. This news gave me more hope. I expect the operation will work well."
1829,"I think that the action of the emperor Akihito was really great. Because, he handed a letter to a chamberlain immediately and left no comment. I think emperor Akihito understand the role of an emperor in japan. If the emperor expresses an specific political attitude, it violates the constitutions of japan. And critics should accuse of him in public, not in the Internet. I also think Taro Yamamoto should have find other ways to express his opinion."
1830,"I am sad to read this news. I thought international events such as World Cups or the Olympics make severe economical situation better. There are many migrants suffering from slavery labour for those events. This is like we , who live in developed countries, are the privileged classes in the old days exploiting slaves to have fun. I feel sorry for the migrants."
1831,A voluntary assistance is a good idea that I did not come up with.
1832,"This is like the world in George Orwell's novel, '1984'. What NSA has done is certainly unacceptable. Actually, the US's spying scares me more than fear of terrorism dose."
1833,"I think this miserable accident originates in Immigration issues. In the world as well as Europe, the issues cause so many accidents of this kind, social problems, and even disputes. The root causes of immigration issues lie deep, including historical problems and racial discrimination etc. Therefore, it is so difficult to solve the big issues, but we can solve the accidents kind of this. To solve them, independent organizations, such like UN and NPO, should intervene between immigrant countries. It is also important to increase the number of immigrant countries, including Japan limiting immigrants. Solving seemingly small problems such like this boat accident will finally help us to solve big issues, immigration issues."
1834,"I insist that the use of drones should be ended right now. This is mainly because it makes soldiers be lack of senses of killing people and guilty, and thereby increases the number of civilian casualties. Actually, the Gulf War, being also called Nintendo War after using missiles and drones, had more civilian casualties than usual wars. The same can be said of Iraq War. Soldiers only use monitors to decide where to launch missiles and drones, and after that, only press a button to exterminate the place. It kills many people regardless of his or her sex and age. This indiscriminate killing should be strongly punished. To prevent the miserable killings, UN should constitute the international laws which bans the use of drones and punish soldiers who kills many civilians."
1835,"Until I read this news, I had vague knowledge about sleep. I knew that sleep was important for us and kept our health, but I did not know that sleep washed away the waste toxins in our brains. I cannot imagine that cells in my brain shrink during sleep and fluid flows in the gaps between brain tissue. Recently, lack of sleep among young people in Japan has become a social problem and so they, including me, should notice the function of sleep and sleep enough. Finally, discoveries in science kind of this may improve our lives and lead us to the right way. Although I know but little of science and technology, but I want governments more to support studies of science."
1836,"This news surprised me, because the US, which has the biggest influence on the General Assembly in the UN, was accused of its military action. The US has attacked many countries to counter terrorism and to protect people from a tyrant, as if it was the world police. However, even if its purpose is to make peace, relying on weapons cannot be a solution. Moreover, thousands of civilians have been killed in drone strikes. This will create new hatred between people or nations so that conflicts will never end. The UN General Assembly should stop relying on the US army and should take an alternative way to counter terrorism."
1837,"I think that essentially cause of this disaster is existence of nuclear plant. A lot of people had wanted abolition of nuclear plant, but the government did not abolish it. Then this disaster occurred, so I think this disaster could be protect in advance. From the above I wrote, I think nuclear plant should be abolished earlier."
1838,The findings of this research are very interesting. It was amazing that sleep removes the waste toxins from the brain. I had only thought that sleep made the body get relaxed and recover from tiredness. The government and companies should help this research financially so that a lot of new facts about the brain's waste removal system would be found out. I hope that the way to cure Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will be found in the near future and all the patients in the world will be able to share the benefits.
1839,"I think bugging is bad think. But it can be justified by the circumstances. In this case, the purpose to bug is for protecting own country against terrorism. Of course, the basic human rights should be respected. But common welfare has a priority to the basic human rights."
1840,"I agree with this article. I really think that nuclear energy is not good for the earth. Originally, there is no nuclear energy. But in fact, there is a lot of nuclear energy in Japan. So I think that we should treat this carefully and decrease this little by little. But I also think this plan is low productive because it doesn't solve this serious problem."
1841,"I think that it is cruel and I feel sad to read this news. That is certain for sure , holding World Cups or Olympic Games bring a profit all the aspects. But it is necessary to put worker's in substance shoes. I think it should be make things better."
1842,"I feel bad to read this news. I think that the United States of America wants to be stand at advantage over all over the world. So, I think that this action is not good."
1843,"I agree with this article. I understand the nuclear energy is not good for the our health or the earth. But in this 21s century, a lot of nuclear power are used. I think that it is necessary for us to be carefully when we use this power."
1844,"This news is very interesting for me. I cannot sleep long time recently because I was being very busy. However, I read this report and noticed the importance of sleep. I was the first to have heard that sleep washes a brain. I want to get more information about toxins. I think that I will sleep the longest possible time from now on."
1845,I think that Drone strikes is that it is not really good. An uninhabited airplane will be able to kill people. War may become game feeling. And a civilian's victims will further increase in number. This is not allowed even if it is the United Nations. I want to Drone strikes were disappeared all over the world.
1846,"This accident is a really miserable accident. We have to accept this accident with sincerity. And never don't cause that it is the same as that of future. Therefore, it is necessary to study this incident thoroughly and to knead a preventive measure."
1847,"I was surprised to hear that. I think this State Secrecy Bill is needed in Japan. It is because Japan does not has one. According to this article,this new bill will encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan.In order to counter Korea and Chinese and terrorists,it is also needed. I agree with it."
1848,I am afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. I want the lawmakers to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately in order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution.
1849,"In my opinion,I think the law is needed Japan today because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing.We have to protect the important information.Indeed the freedom of the citizens is also important but the security of our country is more,I think."
1850,"Drone strikes is really make this world peace? It if fact that sometimes force is needed, but now we don't want all world to war. Specifically, when America did strike Syria, they were accused and their people felt sad of own country's action.I think America should not repeat same fail."
1851,"I felt a bit nervous when I heard this news. I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation.However , it is not a proper time to approve a law which deeply related to trust against the nation.After the nuclear power plants problem, the government has lost its trust deeply ,because of the concealment of accurate information of the problem. As long as the people doubt the nation and unless the government improves its behavior, this kind of law may threaten freedom or right to know about necessary information. The law is necessary but not now, I think."
1852,"I think state secrecy bill threaten the our right-to-know. If this bill carried out, the government easily hide disadvantageous information, for example, nuclear power plant. Also, that means that the government change information. Under this bill, we cannot get correct information. We can say that this bill is a breach of the constitution."
1853,"I thought this bill should be discarded. Shinzo Abe said this bill was needed in japan because we shred secrets with allied countries.But I think that for example, U.S have a state secrecy bill though they have also a sunshine law ( a public information act ). In japan, we don't have enough a public information law. This law's definition of secrets is unclear. So I think this bill must be discarded now!"
1854,"I oppose to the bill.I think we have rights to access national information.The law infringes on our rights and this situation may be touch-and-go to make Japan a despotic state.My dream is to be a journalist and to report information for good life of everyone,so I am concerned with the problem about this law very much."
1855,"When this bill takes effect, of course people will not be able to access the information which the state recognizes secret one. For example information about nuclear power plants. Therefore the arguments of the anti-nuclear activities will be suppressed because they can not get information which bases their claims. I think this situation breaks the constitution of Japan, freedom of thought. So this law violates the fundamental human rights. I think that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should reconsider about the role of the constitution of Japan, people observe the state power."
1856,"Maybe, Its meaning isn't protect our security that this bill was concluded. The ruling party seems to want to return to past. We have to understand importance of got freedom. The Japanese ruling party is becoming more conservative. I want to say them that we never make a war. Anyway, it should not have to decide important such laws in a hurry."
1857,"I do not strongly afraid and think that our lives are infringed by approving the secrecy bill.I have never lived,being conscious of right to know or press freedom.If we know that for example information about nuclear power plants,what we can do concretely?Considering the present international relation of Japan,we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan.So I basically agree with the bill.However,I cannot admire the Japanese government because the ruling party was so hurry to make the bill that bill's definition is so vague and broad.Regarding this point,we should think carefully,spending much more times.It was by no means praiseworthy."
1858,"I agree with ID1321 thinking. I am also afraid the law will suppress the freedom of press. In order not to the law will be applied illegally against constitution,we must understand this new bill.It is not true that there are only good things about it."
1859,"I was surprised, seeing this report. It is because the government has put pressure on mass media in Japan in which I live. It will become impossible for me to trust the Japanese government. The government thinks that it must not make information secret. It is because Japan has kept our lives."
1860,I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms. Press freedom and freedom of thought are very important for democracy.
1861,"Making a state secret bill is good for Japanese Government and other countries. Maybe it was strange that Japan didn't have such law as a member of developed countries. However, important informations should be released to the people, because they have the right to know. I think everything shouldn't known by the people, but the information which should be known as Japanese people should be released."
1862,"I don't think that the state secrecy bill should've been approved. As people in the passage say, it probably takes the teeth out of democracy. People will be less interested in knowing about politics and complain about it. Although I can understand what Abe is explaining, what I do not understand is the the merit of making the bill for us. Is there no benefit for us? If so, I would like Mr. Abe to explain how important it is for Japanese society and how he is going to make up for the opportunities that citizens would have had if it had not been approved. It should not be good to give final approval to it without much explanations to people."
1863,"I was surprised at this news. The state secrecy bill was presented on November 26th and that was passed on December 6th. I cannot be understood how the society will change, but I willing to think about that."
1864,"I don't agree with this bill. Of course, Japan have to strengthen more not only national security but also global one. In that point, the bill is effective. However, the bill has other element that we don't know government's decision-making process. The bill also has bad points to Japanese people because Japanese people have the right to know. I think that this bill of the disadvantage is greater than the benefit. I want Prime Minister Abe to make a new law in order to strengthen both national and global security without undermining Japan's democracy."
1865,"I haven't understand this bill. What will become crime? Many people are making noise against this bill. I can't understand this too. I think we had got few 'secret' up to now, so I think we don't have to make a fuss right now. Of cause we will have to stop prime minister when he try to get too much power."
1866,"I was very angry when I read this news because the secret law is terrible. Under the this law, people couldn't research about the particular secret, and this secret is decided by the government. So the government can control about the nation's opinion. I can't believe the government because they hide a lot of important information which the nation should know. I never want to be controlled like this government."
1867,"I think that the contents of state secret law is not bad. Japanese government had no effective law to crack down on spies. It is a very serious problem for our country. So we need this law. However, the way to approve is bad. It is natural that some people fear that they cannot protest against the government. The government have to relieve their mind. However, I think Japanese government did not do it at all."
1868,"I am somewhat worried to this state secret low. I have a question not to the contents of this bill but to how to determine. The government approved this bill forcibly. I think that the time of talks was more nearly required. Since having been decided is unavoidable, this bill is wanted to be used correctly."
1869,"I'm against this bill. I have two reasons for this. First,I'm afraid that this bill will threaten the freedom of speech and press. Second, this bill makes it difficult for people to check government decision. If we can't know the information about the government, we can't check anything. With these reasons, I'm against this bill."
1870,"I'm against the new state secrecy bill. The government said that the purpose was to strengthen Japan's role in global security and create a more authoritarian government at home, but I couldn't fully understand the advantage of it. Far from that, I thought there were more risks as Kyouji Yanagisawa said. I also couldn't understand why the bill was passed though many Japanese and foreign journalists, writers, academics and activists had all opposed the bill. Wasn't it the democratic government? This news story gave me a question about a recent political system."
1871,I agree with the secret law.I think Japan needs the secret law today.Because there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing.We should to protect the important information.
1872,"When I read this article, I am afraid of our peace of ordinary lives. This new law punishes the people who talking or leaking the secret of Japan national security. And it means that the state watch us. I can't imagine how watch the state us. It is so scaring thing. The state should protect itself from the outside. But this new law is really necessary for us? I can't think so."
1873,"I think some media threaten us too much.By secret law,I think,our lives will not be dameged.However,we should check the law because government may use law unappropriately.To defense and save the important information, this law is necessary,but government should not concern information which should be open to us."
1874,"I'm glad when I heard that Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status. I like washoku because it's healthy and it tastes really nice.My grandmother used to have her own washoku shop, and I like eating her washoku.So I want to tell my grandmother about this news."
1875,This decision which add to the United Nation's cultural heritage list is a matter of course. I love to eat hot rice with a natto and a grated yam. It can be say that Washoku is just Japanese culture. However diversification of food is progressing in Japan. Japanese have to keep the washoku as tradition. I also continue to love the washoku.
1876,Nelson Mandela is great. Because he fought for resolve the racial discrimination. To solve racial stereotype is difficult. It is thanks to people like him that racial problem is getting less. We have to keep the freedom and equality which is they got. I would like to express my condolences and thank to him.
1877,"I think that this is so big and good news for Japan. Japanese cuisine is losing its confidence because of Fukushima nuclear crisis. And Japanese taste is changing to European one. I feel that 'washoku' becomes outdated. So, I expect the UNESCO heritage status to get back the respect to washoku."
1878,"I really wish that this problem will be solved as soon as possible, and want the government not to cause the same thing again though it's useless to complain about what had already happened. Now The US help us Japan solve it, it'll great if we help one another in the world and have actual good relationship with them in the future. So after Japan's solving the problem, our role will come. There are countless people in need all around the world. On the other hand, I think it's the very time to put all the Japanese potential together! I hope that Japan will become one regardless of who are scientists, politicians or diplomats to solve it."
1879,"I feel dizzy. Democracy is important, of course. we need liberty, too. However, we have to protect ourselves from spies abroad and something like this, so we will lose something important which we achieved thanks to many sacrifices. I think that everyone actually knows what is right or wrong, and what we should do, but they're never free from human greed, and some act things just for themselves. However, we should always try to move in a right direction despite any enemies standing in front of us."
1880,"When I heard this news first, I was surprised because I couldn't feel anything special about washoku and I didn't know it was valued highly. These days, we are tending to eat unhealthy foods such as fast foods. Of course they are superior to heritage cuisine at the point of price, convenience and constantly. But we mustn't lose the spirit to be thankful to what give you their lives."
1881,"In studying history, almost every character keeps its own position based on his benefit, especially during a war. But Nelson Mandela was not. Though he declared to separate non-white from white and began to suppress non-white, he changed his mind and declared non-white's right. He cleaned his sin up in the name of peace. I was moved by his story."
1882,I was glad to hear this news. Because I myself like Japanese cuisine very much. Shrimps and fishes are fresh and have low fat compared to meat. And the tradition of Japan will be protected thanks to this approval of UNESCO. Also I think this acknowledgment of UNESCO help ally the fear about the safety of Japanese food after 3.11 because official organization approved its value during this period. These facts may get more people regard Japanese food as better than before. And I hope this event prompts Japanese economy through many foreign people consuming a lot of its food.
1883,"I liked your opinion because it was unique. Of course spying is unpleasant because it infringes the country's right. But the best is should be the situation any country have no secrets, same as human. However, once each countries had their weapons, making the ideal situation must be impossible. So it may be true that spying is natural, and each countries must keep their secrets not to be revealed."
1884,"I'm impressed to read this news article. How surprising a person who had been in prison for as many as 27 years changed the country! Now I believe that important thing is not to give up anytime if something terrible happen, and not to look at the past but the present for the future to find what we really should do. Even if we stumble and lose our hearts, Nelson will encourage us not to give up by memory of his great achievement."
1885,"I'm very happy to read this news article because I love Japanese food as a Japanese and it's very honorable to receive the status which France only has. When I visited abroad, I saw many Japanese restaurants, but they didn't have enough variety of menu and the quality seemed not to be good. However, I heard some praise of them from foreign people, so I believe Japanese food still has potential to get more popularity all around the world. While we has confidence in our national food, we have to get knowledge about it, because it'll be shameful if somebody abroad hear our food to us and can't answer at all."
1886,"A state secrecy bill cast question that what is our freedom to us. Honesty I can't say a state secrecy bill is absolutely bad. In fact, that law can be able a state to hide contents or incidents that is not good for them. That action trespass on people's freedom,that is human right. While that danger, that law may be useful to stay nation in safe. So I think safe system is needed for preventing authorities from abusing."
1887,"I like sleeping. Not, I love sleeping. We usually sleep everyday. Our body need sleep. Especially our brain need sleep to act. This news said that sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins. When we waked up, we feel clear or not so. In case that we felt clear, our brain was cleaned much. I shall clean my brain by sleeping right now!"
1888,"I was glad to hear the news Washoku got the UNESCO heritage because I really like it.Washoku is not salty and not strong tasty.We can enjoy the real taste of food.While various habits in Japan have changed, these habits are still with our daily lives.Of course getting UNESCO heritage status is wonderful and praise-worthy,but I do not have actual feeling because of being a part of our daily lives.And at the same time I think we are too ignorant about Japanese culture and we have to get knowledge about it,not to feel humiliated."
1889,"I admire Nelson Mandela's courage against authoritarian government. Thanks to him, the political system of South Africa changed. I think democracy is necessary to get rid of discrimination. So,now I want many African young people to try to bring democracy and freedom to the non democratic country. I know it is very difficult, but I think it is the people that changes the political system of a country and found a nation where there is no discrimination. Also other democratic nations should help achieve this.For example Japan can use its ODA to teach the way to change the administration systems or help countries do development of laws."
1890,"I didn't know Nelson Mandela well, so I read other article about him and I knew that he lived to be 95 years of age. I think it's enough. His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ''Our nation has lost its greatest son.'' Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace."
1891,"I like western food and fast food. Of course, I like Washoku, too. It's healthy and beautiful. It's good thing that foreign people become interested in Japanese traditional food. Washoku contest for foreign people was also held, the skills were very high and a lot of new ideas that Japanese people couldn't hit upon were there. Usually, I rarely make Washoku, but reading this article, I decided to make Washoku for dinner tomorrow."
1892,"I was surprised to hear that.This news is good. Because Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status, Japan can get a lot of thing not only in terms of its cultural heritage and potential health benefits, but also in relation to the economy. I am happy!"
1893,"I was surprised to hear that.'When Mandela was finally released 27 years later, his biggest concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together.'This is very positive thinking.And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission (TRC).He is great."
1894,"I'm pleased about Japan's traditional cuisine getting UNESCO heritage status.It may the Japanese good aspect appeal to other countries. And ''washoku' will be enjoyment for audience coming the 2020 Olympics! And then, ''washoku'' is healthy. So I think to want that it win fast-foods. Because I think fast-foods overflow in Japan!"
1895,"I wondered that Japan did not have this state secret law until now, because most countries have laws like this. There was more concern that this law is established as there is a voice of protest and demonstration, but the purpose of this law is to strengthen the protection of Japan's secret weak compared to foreign countries. So, I think criticism such that there is a risk toward the war to establish this law.Simply because it is a difficult problem with safety assurance, it is a problem that we must discuss also established later."
1896,"I was delighted to hear the news washoku got the UNESCO heritage. Washoku is tasty and good for our health. Although obesity due to disturbance of the balance of the meal has been a problem in the USA and so on, if washoku spreads around the world, it might be able to resolve the problem of obesity. So washoku should be ate by a lot of people. And I hope the problem surrounding the food of Japan like 'washoku away' or 'harmful rumor' is made an improvement in the wake of this."
1897,This news is very good news for Japanese people.Cuisine express the national character.Adding to the United Nation's cultural heritage list is honor for us and shows 'Washoku' is in demand.I want to understand the other countries by cuisine.
1898,"State secret law is difficult to interpret.Not only the people,but also politician don't understand the details of this law.However,I think it is not god to criticize the idea of this law.The problem is the vagueness of the text. I afraid to use this law subjectively by malevolent man."
1899,"Honestly,I didn't know Nelson Mandela and understand the greatness of him. However, I feel the importance of the will. In spite of the imprisonment for 27 years, his will didn't change.Therefore, his will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system. He taught us the greatness of indomitably."
1900,"We notice that there is always a catch in a good deal in this accident.We have believed safety myth of nuclear power.However,we must be careful with the fault of this power. Japan has big energy problem,so we should consider the future of energy immediately."
1901,"I agree with your opinion. US is the one of the most powerful nation,so US ought to consider world peace. However, the world peace is made up of the good relations between countries.If US consider the counter-terrorism strategy, they must not use the way like this case."
1902,"I don't agree with your thinking.The government say the fabrication in many times.However, it is sometimes necessary to protect nation. If the politicians must say only the truth, the trust of government is broken immideately.I think it is important for us to monitor arbitrary action of the government and to understand the idea of this law."
1903,"I think Mandela can be said to be the person had South America been reborn. We will never let race discrimination like apartheid again. And we should strive for making 'rainbow nation' that coexist with people of having a different skin color. This word was introduced by Mandela. Recently, the news that a sign language interpreter had used inappropriate sign language at the Mandela's memorial service is focus much on, but we don't forget mourning for the late Mandela."
1904,"Merkel, is referred to as the 'Iron Lady' in the same way as Thatcher former Prime Minister, has been selected repeatedly in the U.S. business magazine 'Forbes' as a woman with the power in the world. I think she is an influential people like this, so this incident Merkel's cell phone had been eavesdropping is an serious issue that shakes not only Germany, but the world. Also for the future, the relationship between Germany and the United States is not deteriorated, the United States will have to accept this incident with sincerity. Also, I think Japan must also be measures with a sense of crisis."
1905,"I was happy to read this news that Japanese cuisine got UNESCO heritage status because I like washoku very much. It is an honor merely to become only the second nation after France to have its national cuisine designated heritage status, a decision made by officials at a UNESCO meeting in Azerbaijan. But there is anxiety for Japan to have earthquake and tsunami triggered the on-going Fukushima nuclear crisis, shattering global confidence in the safety of NATO's previously respected food industry. I want to think about the problem."
1906,"I'm proud to hear this news. Washoku is certainly one of the best cuisine in the world,because it's not only delicious but also healthy.Taste and its healthiness are strong point of Washoku,but not only that.There are special charm,attractive atmosphere peculiar to Washoku. It often changes,influenced by fashion in that time,or seasons.It's beyond description so it's hard to explain but these are the reasons why I like Washoku,and I hope these appeal point will be recognize by this designation."
1907,"Many people might mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. I was also one of the such people because I had respected him for his brave action. During the time of discrimination, he had never given up opposing to it in spite of severe situation. Moreover, after he released, his biggest concern was making sure that the country remained together instead of revenge for his mistreatment, and he held public hearings, TRC. When I learned about this, I even more admired him for his indomitable spirit and tolerance."
1908,"I was glad to hear that 'washoku' was added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list because it would make 'washoku' more popular. As the news story said, 'washoku' doesn't only taste good but also it is healthy, so I want everyone to like it. However, I have heard that people nowadays tend to eat less 'washoku' and eat more 'Western food'. I hope many people will eat more 'washoku' than now and appeal it to the world."
1909,"When I read this news, I was very grad because this fact shows that Japanese cuisine is admitted to the world. Japanese cuisine is healthy and easy to eat. So I like it very much. But after the Fukushima earthquake, the rumor of which contents is Japanese food is polluted by radiation spread in the world. I think this rumor isn't right. It is true that a lot of radiation flow in the sea. However, it may be part of all. I believe most of Japanese food is safety."
1910,"Now, Japanese-style food is Japan's representative. Japanese-style food is popular for overseas people. Japan should also become famous because Japanese-style food becomes world heritage. We have to advertise Japanese-style food more. If it is successful, the future of Japan will become good."
1911,"I was very shocked because I respected him very much. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength. However, South Africa is one of the most differential countries in the world even though Mandela governed this country. I worry about the future of the country."
1912,"I think that it is very good news for us. I was very happy because I like Japanese cuisine. I think this news means that people in the world appreciated that Japanese cuisine is very delicious. Washoku played a big part in human's sense of taste. For example, 'umami' and 'koku' was discovered by Japanese cuisine. How wonderful washoku is!"
1913,"I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However, I also heard this news and became somewhat sad. A movie called Invictus became the cause for me to get to know Mandela. I would also like to become a great human being who can hand down a name to future generations like him."
1914,"I was so pleased to hear that washoku is registered with UNESCO heritage. I prefer washoku to other country's dishes, because I feel washoku's seasoning is most exquisite. I hope that this good news will trigger activation of reconstruction of Japan."
1915,"I was so sad to hear this news. I learned about his achievement in the world history. He fought for racial equality in Republican Of South Africa. Now,in Republican Of South Africa,black and white are living together. His achievement is so great."
1916,"I was very surprised to read this article. He was a brave man. He protested against racial discrimination and make The South Africa equal country. Maybe he had many difficulties, however he overcome all of these. We lost great person."
1917,"I was so happy to hear this news. Now,I feel that Japanese are not proud of Japan and love foreign culture and evaluate Japanese culture as old-fashioned culture. But foreigners evaluate Japanese culture as sublime beauty. I think that Japanese should reevaluate our culture by foreigner's evaluation."
1918,I am very happy to hear this news. Washoku use less oil and much vegetable. Washoku keep you healthy. I'd like many foreigner to eat washoku. Miss Universe world congress champion 2007 Riyo Mori introduce the wonderfulness of washoku to the world. She claimed that washoku make you healthy and beautiful.
1919,"Now that Japanese foods is very popular in world because of it's healthiness. And this helps Nihonshoku be UNESCO heritage. I'm so pleased to see this news and proud of Japanese foods. But,at the same time,I think that it is needed to correct misunderstandings of Japanese foods and to eliminate fake Nihonshoku."
1920,I'm so sorry to hear this news. I do not know this achievement in detail. But everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. There is still this kind of discrimination now. So it is the time to remember his achievements.
1921,"I think it very good that washoku was accepted globally. In Japan, washoku's culture is on the decline now. However, washoku is very important culture, and it must make it continue. It is wishing people that washoku spreads further."
1922,"I don't know which side should be taken. we need this law because our country have secrets. And it is not good for other countries to know this secrets. But, at the same time,this law can be very dangerous."
1923,I find sleeping very important for human being after read this article. I usually sleep for 7 hours and I think it's better to keep this. But I heard long sleeping is not good for human body as well.So I want to know about long sleep.
1924,"Japanese traditional cuisine is very good. Because, it is very healthy. Washoku is very good for people. It is not only healthy but also beautiful.Beauty is its shape. Of course, taste is good, but I can enjoy seeing I think people all over the world should eat Washoku more!!"
1925,"I support the state secrecy bill. Japan did not have spy prevention laws, and so Japan allowed spies easily to steal information. This bill can prevent leak of important information related to national defense. Furthermore, this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Although there are those who oppose this bill because this bill, they argue, infringes public right of access information, I think they don't fully understand the contents of this bill. Actually, this bill is not very related to the public. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are classified in four categories; defense, diplomacy, prevention of threats to safety and terrorism. It is meaningless for the public to know information about these categories. Therefore, this bill doesn't infringe our rights and bolster national security."
1926,It is right that some Japanese people don't take pride in Japanese culture. But you must remember that one of the most favorite food in Japan is still sushi. I think Japanese people still have the mind the loves our culture.
1927,UNESCO world heritage is just getting ridiculous. It was originally intended to save and preserve heritage that was in neglect or danger of destruction but it has now turned into an international quango with governments lobbying and no doubt paying money to boast about how special they are.
1928,I totally agree with you. We should respect him and eliminate racial discrimination.
1929,"I agree with you. Japan should protect the secrets to protect our own country.However,it may occur that this law limit more information than necessary. And this leads to violate individual privacy."
1930,"I was shocked. The world lost shine. I think he was the greatest person ever. And I think he was loved many people especially reporter, because every article tell us only his greatness. There're no abuse in the article. Mandela R.I.P."
1931,"Japanese cuisine is very unique in the world.Washoku is very healthy and very delicious.Japanese people love its tastes.However,Western food has spread over Japan,and frequency of our contact to Washoku is diminished.But this acquisition of UNESCO heritage status can be a chance for us to reconsider about importance of Washoku in Japanese culture.So I am glad to know this news very much."
1932,"I'm glad to hear this news because I like washoku very much. I think washoku is one of the most prided Japanese culture, but traditional washoku culture is being changed. We should improve traditional washoku culture again."
1933,"When I heard this news, it made me happy! Washoku is Japanese traditional dish and I love it. I am very proud of it. I want many people to come to Japan to eat Washoku."
1934,"I told him thanks. He is a just and tolerant symbol in the world. He had appealed black persons' rights! And they could get rights. If I were him, I must seek revenge on white persons for something until now. But he didn't it. He had not had prejudice. So we should know his policy more. And I want to be a tolerant person as he. I pray that his soul may rest in peace."
1935,"What Japanese cuisine got UNESCO heritage status made Japanese happy. Japanese cuisine has been famous for healthy food. Although the especially famous Japanese cuisine is SUSHI or TEMPURA and so on, there are more good taste and healthy food in them. In this time, getting UNESCO heritage state may be good opportunity to be known about more Japanese cuisine around the world."
1936,A disaster can easily cause next disaster. We know the danger of the earthaquach.Moreover that earthquake caused a much disaster. We Japanese feared that disaster. We never want to occur the same But his action is wrong and lacks common sense.In democracy we should do political action by right way.
1937,I sympathize with you. The sentence 'there is not 100% safety in the real world' shocked me and informed me of our life that is next to danger. We should make more safety society for myself.
1938,"I didn't know this news and I was surprised. Because I thought North Korea hid all the accidents like commit treason. I don't know the intention why North Korea released this news, but I think Kim Jong Un try to attract other countries' attention. I worry the action of North Korea."
1939,"I think this mention is important. Recently, we have came to tend to like eating European food, like hamburger and so on. I don't think European food is bad. But it is bad not to treat it valuably.We should notice the uniqueness of it."
1940,"I agree with you. And I think the longer the wiretapping had been done, the more difficult it is to broken recover trust. Mr. Obama looks gentleman. I want him to behavior as gentleman to Ms. Merkel and other presidents."
1941,"I like your opinion, too. When I read your comment, I noticed that I had the image ''The spy is natural in USA.'' It' interesting, and I thought people's opinion can easily affected by some news or other people's opinion."
1942,"I was very surprised at this news. Because Mr. Jang Song-thaek was killed by the real nephew. In Japan, committing murder in relative is a grave offense. I cannot kill my relative whatever they did."
1943,The execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly that I couldn't understand what had happened in the North Korean. Moreover its politics has been unclear. Those facts have made me feel fear. The whole world also have got nervous. I hope there will not be terrible happening.
1944,"I know sleeping is so important to maintain our health, but why is it so important? I don't know about it. I often hear that sleeping arranges our memory. So I was surprised sleeping washes away the waste toxins build up a hard day's thinking. Today, sleeping must not be solved perfectly. I wish more research will be conducted about sleeping mechanism."
1945,"I was glad to read this article because I loved Japanese cuisine. Japanese cuisine is famous as unique and healthy food. Recently, many Japanese food called 'washoku' is eaten everywhere, for example, 'sushi', 'tempura' or 'takoyaki'. I wish Japanese food will be widespread in the world and more people will become more healthy."
1946,"I am glad and proud of this news as a Japanese. Because the Tokyo Olympics were just decided, I hope to spread out Japanese foods more. In addition, there is the already new movement including the Japanese foods contest of the foreign chef, and I look forward to that Japanese foods become major."
1947,"I think so, too. It is necessary that we realize the good point of the Japanese foods again and improve it. Because the Japanese food is good for health and delicious, I think we should protect this culture. If this news become a motive of it, I am glad."
1948,"I think him to be the one of the great man. Usually, even if we had a purpose like him, it is rare that we act as he did , and I think that there are some situations that can not improve, if there is not a person like him. I think he left big hope and achievement."
1949,"I'm very afraid of North Korea.If Kim Jong Un hates someone, he(she) will be executed. We can't allow this behavior because of the democracy.Charisma success the autocracy in smart way for better or worse. However,Kim Jong un is going to predominant by the violence.This nation will not survive much longer."
1950,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Japanese that live now take it for granted that this country has the peace, but we have to think again about the mistake."
1951,"The present North Korea government won't be able to steady. Because the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought. The government will be excluded by someone who have different thought. So, forcible governance such this doesn't result in peace. It's not confined North Korea."
1952,"I do not agree with your opinion. Whatever reasons USA has, the way that uses weapons should not be justified."
1953,"I do not know Mandela at all, but I know that he was a great man for the world. If I have a chance to know him, I learn about acts that he did."
1954,"I did not know this news and I was surprised at this. Because I do not quite understand this news, I want to read up on this subject."
1955,"As many people said, I was very glad to hear this news. I would like everyone in the world to know the art of Washoku with its public attention. Although I do not really like some of the Japanese food like raw salmon, the taste of it, I always notice how beautiful Washoku looks when I get to eat it. Plenty of fish, rice and vegetables with so many lovely colors can be found. Knowing this, it would be great for us if more people are interested in Japanese culture and visit Japan."
1956,"I agree with you. We cannot allow Kim Jong Un's behavior because we are living in a democratic society, unlike despotic society of North Korea. Knowing this news, I just felt the difference of political system between North Korea and Japan. The execution of political leaders without a fair trial.. how scary is that! I sympathize with North Korean people. All I can do for them is to hope that they obtain peaceful living in the near future."
1957,"I think this news has great influence on many countries.We can't know that the reason of execution of Mr.Jang is correct,because North Korea is one of the countries that others can't see the inside of the political circumstances.This accident might have been caused by someone's intention,but the truth can't be known.Not only other countries but also the nation of North Korea don't know clearly policy of that country.It is important that other near countries watch the situation carefully."
1958,"I'm writing this comment January 1st. I ate 'Osechi' this morning. Osechi has many type of dishes. This is so Japanese. Washoku use seasonable food, I think this is very good culture. Because, seasonable food is very tasty and affordable price. And we can feel 4 seasons. I take pride in Washoku."
1959,"I'm afraid of North Korea will wage war. I can't imagine what do Kim Jong Un want to do. North Korea have atomic bomb and missile, so if Kim will take charge Japan will be attacked. We have to avoid the war. But I don't know what we have to do, because North Korea is so closed country. I want North Korea to accept a proposal of conference."
1960,I was thinking the same thing as what you think. This incident looks like controlled society that is drawn by George Orwell. So what NSA has done is supposedly impermissible thing. We must stop the runaway of the organization and nation.
1961,"Drones is easy to kill people, so I think using drones is very dangerous, too. But a courier service by drones is started in Australia, it is a useful use to reduce costs by using drones. So I guess it can't hurt to think another method of using."
1962,"I agree with your opinion.Japanese government abolish all nuclear plants is very difficult as long as I think. I think they should abolish nuclear plants in stages. So, we should continue to think about whole concept of nuclear plants, too."
1963,"I agree with your idea. The great thing of Mandela is that he had not had prejudice about white person. We should be a tolerant as he. I felt tempted to tell him thanks, too."
1964,"I knew that sleep is important for our health before read this news. However,I think many people don't get enough sleep. We will sleep 20 years for 80 years if we sleep for six hours per day. Therefore I want to get the sleep of good quality."
1965,"I agree with the secret law.When I read this news I think that the claim of the opposition is not logical. This bill was decided for a diplomatic reason. However, the opposition pays attention to only domestic things. Of course diplomacy to be more important than an internal affair. This bill isn't the best,bat this law is better than now one. People should think what is important and what is better action."
1966,"Recently many people say 'Japanese government have to remove nuclear power plant.' Certainly, it is true, but I think maybe they are little bit irresponsibility. Because, when government built power plant, people want to make it, and Fukushima people had to move another place, since then, we used huge electricity, but after accident, people say 'we don't need nuclear power plant!' I think it is too selfish. I think we don't have just to take objection to nuclear power plant, we have to think about how we support Fukushima people."
1967,"Yeah, I think so! Washoku is so healthy and delicious! The reason why I like washoku is we can feel 4 seasons in washoku."
1968,I think so. The most difficult issue is nobody knows the truth of this incident. We have to pay attention against North Korea's action.
1969,I agree. I think Japanese government have to abolish. But first of all government have to help Fukushima people.
1970,"I think washoku is Japanese great traditional cuisine that has to been protected.Now,many people eat western cuisine,because we can eat them more faster and easier.So people have less opportunities to make and eat Japanese food.But,its seasonal food and color are beautiful and it has been made long time ago.This decision make us continue this Japanese custom.We should protect and keep culture."
1971,"I think Mandela left a big achievement.As a South Africa's first black president,his action had great meaning.At the same time,other countries watch his movement carefully,so he took heavy responsibility.I think he had influence on all over the world,because he acted positively even after having been sent to prison.He became a good model for other countries where there are many black people."
1972,"I think the information has a influence and worth in modern society.Now,we can manage information easily through the communication tools such as cell phone and computer.In the other hand,information could be leaked easily too,even if we use them carefully.For countries,the information are more important and has many risks.Once this kind of accident happened,it is difficult to make up the lack of transparency."
1973,"I believed that holding World Cup had a good effect on a host country as it needs construction of many buildings, infrastructure and transportation and that this gave a great chance to get a job to people both in the host country and in the countries around it. On the other hand, it didn't come to my mind that migrant workers had been forced to work under a very bad condition. The Qatar 2022 supreme committee should improve the working condition immediately. In addition, it must compensate workers and their families for their injuries and deaths with sufficient money. I hope that benefits of hosting World Cup 2022 will be shared by as many people as possible."
1974,"It was not surprising to me that the US spied among its allies, because the country doesn't even hesitate to monitor its own people's telecommunication and logs on the Internet. I understand Merkel's anger. Nevertheless, I suspect that leaders of EU member countries could have known the fact, or that they did the same or similar allegations as the US did. In a case of a personal matter, spying your friends is never acceptable. However, regarding diplomacy, many countries have spied each other. In our time, information technology has been developing rapidly. Every country needs to reconsider its data agreements based on trust with its allies."
1975,"I insist that breaking taboo itself is a bad thing. I don't think people suffering evacuation life want Mr. Yamamoto to complain about their plight by such a childish way. He should have persuade other members of the Diet and strive to pass a bill that helps victims as a member of the House of Councilors. However, thinking his difficult situation, this standard way could never have succeeded. It is because he doesn't belong to any party, and LDP, the ruling party, has so strong power that they never listen to the opinions of the minority parties or members. I guess that Mr. Yamamoto realized how small his power to change policies was, and handed a letter thoughtlessly. I hope he will keep making steady efforts to abolish nuclear power plants."
1976,"I am greatly concerned about this bill. As the article says, this law would allow the government to keep people away from important information by force so that we could not make a political decision. Such a situation is really similar to the one made by Japanese military regime under WWII. Moreover, I was very disappointed because Prime Minister Abe forced to pass the bill very quickly, ignoring all the criticisms and concerns. They should have spent much more time to discuss the bill. I would like Abe administration to listen to the opposite before passing bills by force of numbers."
1977,"Mr. Biden said one thing to one side and something different to another. As a result, he completely failed in lowering tensions in the East Asia. Recently, the tension in this region has risen because of territorial problems. China (and Taiwan), South Korea and Japan are very eager to gain territorial rights over the islands in the East China Sea in order to protect their national interests in terms of defense, fishery, and natural resources as well. I hope that all these countries should cooperate to avoid armed conflicts and find a point of compromise. Regarding the US, it should stop too much intervention than is necessary not to change the status quo. Japanese government shouldn't rely on the US, since its purpose is just to increase its influence in Asia."
1978,"I was very shocked to hear the news and mourned over his death. Many people must have been moved by his activities that trying to help those who had been horribly discriminated against. I believe that he contributed to make South African and African people be proud of themselves and gave them power to protest against apartheid policies. Now the great leader has gone. We must take over his will, and strive to get rid of segregation until all the people on the earth can live peacefully."
1979,"Hearing the news, I was very surprised since I had supposed that UNESCO had mainly designated traditional performing arts as Intangible Cultural Assets. It had never occurred to me that a way of cooking could be recognized as a world heritage. Now western dishes are very popular all over Japan. However, this designation showed us that Japanese traditional food culture was highly evaluated in the world and thought to be a common asset of human beings. It is a great opportunity to realize again the importance of passing our traditional cuisine down from generation to generation. We should be proud of washoku and make efforts to protect and improve it."
1980,"The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on not only stability of North Korea regime yet the situation of its people living in poverty. The article says that Mr. Kim tries to strengthen his power by 'resorting to 'a reign of terror,'' but I think this kind of internal power struggle will decrease loyalty to Kim dynasty, and weaken the whole country. When a person disagrees with you, killing him is the worst way to solve the problem. It isn't even a solution. Unless Mr. Kim accepts a variety of opinions when running the government, there's no possibility that people in North Korea will live a stable life."
1981,"This news is really miserable. I think this accident has many important problems. For example, people who has taken that boat was illegal immigrants, and they are lived in developing country. So when they need to help to an other country like this situation, the other country will not try to rescue immediately and seriously, because they are illegal immigrants and they are developing people. This fact is really really sad. But this is true I think. I heard that In fact the rescue didn't come as soon as they can. The illegal immigrants is serious problem."
1982,"I agree with you. But it is difficult that many people be member of some kinds of NGO to support developing countries. I just think that many more people know about some international news like this. By doing this, world will start to change."
1983,"I agree with you. Indeed there is food diversification in Japan and I actually love Western food too,but I think that we have to treasure Washoku as our own culture.For this,in my opinion,for example,the washoku museum should be built."
1984,"I totally agree with you and,what is more,now it is the most important that European countries take migrants more seriously and protect them even if with some requirements."
1985,I agree with you.I learned that what truly makes people happy isn't revenge but pure spirit and effort for people or country from Mandela and Gandhi.
1986,"Since when I read this article,I've tried to sleep as long as possible too because I want to clean my own brain every day.The information of this function encourages us to sleep long and raises the quality of sleep."
1987,"Of course, I know that sleeping is important for our body to keep our health, because my parents always said so when I was kid. But I didn't know why sleeping helps to keep our health. I never know that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. That fact is fantastic!! I really surprised when I read this news. Sleep is good for us, and good for our body."
1988,I was surprised at stating secret law. Because it decided rapidly. I wonder why the government hurried up about it. It was said that the answer was USA's pressure for Japan joining TPP. I think Japan is afraid of America too much. Japan should become a country to have the power and the speaking right. And I concern myself about diet member's concealment increasing by the secret low.
1989,"I was surprised at hearing this news because Japanese traditional cuisine becomes one of the cultural heritage. I don't usually eat it , but I take proud of it after hearing the news."
1990,"I know his name and achievement by studying world history , but I don't know what he exactly did. After reading this news , I researched his achievement and this effect deeply. I think Nelson Mandela is the best politician of all the times."
1991,"Before hearing this news , I tend to sleep longer. Hearing this news , I was relieved because long sleep is not wrong thing."
1992,"Whether or not Drone strikes violate international law , it should not be justified because it can kill a lot of people. Excessive military technology may cause new collision and war and so on , I think."
1993,I disagree with you because I think the law is needed Japan today because the threat of the terrorism is growing and we have to protect the important information.Your concern will be eased if the organization that checks whether the information should be hidden or not. Of course its member mustn't be a member of the government.
1994,"I agree with you. The threat of the terrorism is growing today and actually it is needed to get more information as possible,but governments mustn't get information of privacy. This is human rights,that should be protected first of all."
1995,"I agree with you. In my opinion,he disclosed the news because he tries to attract other countries' attention and say that his power is great,because there is rumor that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated."
1996,"I think so. Mandela was the best person. As you said, South Africa has the gap between poor and rich. I think the current government have to face and deal that problem. If they ignore the issue, Mandela will be sad."
1997,"I agree. The freedom is so important. If this law will press our freedom, it have to be deleted."
1998,"Are you ok? I worry about you. And I can't sleep well, because I have many things which have to do. I wanna sleep."
1999,"I think so. I don't want to be spied from everybody. But I can't blame them. Because to fight with terrorism is very difficult, and we don't have the way to counter-terrorism. If terrorism decrease by spying, I agree with the US."
2000,"Always I think 'what is the justice?' when I read the news like this article. Often the US hero movie write 'hero's enemy is full evil' but it is impossible. Everybody who is doing war, believe 'I am the justice!' so I think this issue is difficult."
2001,"I thinks that South Africa lost the great person. He still has a big influence on the world. He was behind bars for 27 years, however he did not give it up. It point is that we should respect most. People like him what was to live a long life.I'm afraid it."
2002,"I was surprised to hear that news. I can't agree with pass this bill. I think this bill can be dangerous. This bill makes Japanese politicians authoritarian. But, this bill can be efficient law. I think this law can be bad or not depend on how to use. I hope this law is used by politicians for Japan's peace."
2003,"I have understood sleep is important for health. But I didn't know it related diseases. So I became worried about my sleep style. For example, how many hours do I always sleep in a day, in a week, in a month and how does my sleeping condition ? And I am concerned that new sleep can clean the old toxins not to be cleaned past."
2004,"I think so too. This accident is very big scale and very scary. Of course, sinking when you played is very scary , but this sinking of the news is more scary. I pray his soul may rest in peace."
2005,I knew Drone by this article. I think USA should stop using Drone. Because it bombs by only sensing a block of body temperature. So Drone kills many innocent people meaninglessly. And USA government conceals its information. I wish that Japan doesn't become as USA by adopting secret law.
2006,"I was glad to hear that news. I love washoku. I take pride in washoku as Japanese. Washoku is a symbol of Japanese tradition. I think many people appreciate washoku. Fukushima nuclear crisis threatened washoku, but this news makes washoku famous again. Many people in the world discover new merits in washoku. I hope many people enjoy washoku!!!"
2007,I'm proud of Japanese food called Washoku.I think it is a chance that a lot of foreign people are interested in Washoku.We should protect Washoku from junk food such as hamburger and we should spread Washoku to the world.
2008,"Perhaps this news was not widely broadcast in Japan so many people said in the class that they knew the tragedy for the first time. I think this is a problem. Japanese media should let us know more information around the world such as that accident because the gate from Africa to Europe, the Mediterranean is a significant spot, and over 100 people died there. Of course, Poor migrants always consider big risk to go to other places but we must not ignore the risky situations. Rich countries often rely on the labors from poor countries so they should improve the circumstances around the works as minimal repayment."
2009,"The Pakistan ministry of foreign affairs has records of as many as 330 drone strikes in the country's north-western tribal areas since 2004, Up to 2,200 people have been killed of whom at least 400 were civilians. And in Yemen, as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs.This information was shocked to me. Why are innocent of civilians killed? Drone strikes are really dangerous. That is true, but it is difficult to extinguish them completely."
2010,"I think this incident shows that the Kim government is losing power to control and govern the country. Kim government is at the eclipse, I think. The practice of this forcible policy means that Kim Jon Un is hasty to gain power and control the nation but the situation isn't favorable to him . Indeed Jang was the center of the government and the man to contact foreign countries , so I wonder what the loss may cause to the country and the surrounding countries."
2011,I agree with your opinion. I think the government should consider peace. We should think our country. We should change our world.
2012,"I was so surprised to read this article because I respected him. When I watched a legal drama, the hero said that the real devil is huge consensus. White used to control the world. So nobody can act for the solution of race discrimination, but he fought against race discrimination.Race discrimination is tempered as a result."
2013,"I was shocked when I read this article. Political donation problem of Governor of Tokyo was uncovered last month, and Naoki Inose resigned. But it is no more than the scandal about money. There are many problem which is much more terrible problem than Japan."
2014,"I was sad to hear that news.Nepalese workers came to Qatar to earn money. it is bad that Nepalese work in bad condition to held 2022 FIFA World Cup. Many people are looking forward to 2022 FIFA World Cup.However, FIFA World Cup has sad background. Sports festival like this is a symbol of peace. I hope many people in the world enjoy national sports festival. Sports festival can be a ray of hope."
2015,"I agree with your opinion. It is difficult that human judge the weapon like drone strikes is bad or not. However, we should prevent from using dangerous weapon. I don't agree with the use of drone strikes."
2016,"I agree with your opinion. I love Japanese cuisine very much. This acknowledgment of UNESCO must help allay the fear about nuclear power. I hope many foreign people have washoku, too."
2017,"This news is difficult to solve. If the State secrecy law is accepted, government can hide a important information and they can change an another fact easy. But further than that problem, every people can get important information is dangerous I think. if we can get a collect information easy, of course all over the world can get it. Now many terrorism are around, if they catch important information,that is really serious problem."
2018,"I worry about the future situation in North Korea very much.Because Jang Song-Thaek who was executed suddenly was handling nuclear disarmament and economic reform, and Kim Jong Un is now rejecting an international perspective, this incident may cause a bad influence on Japan.The relation between North Korea and our country is very crucial to peace in East Asia. Therefore, I want the authorities act carefully."
2019,"When I read this article, I felt so happy. There are many culture food restaurants or fast food restaurants in Japan. This is not bad thing because we can eat a lot of foods except for Washoku. However, nowadays people eat more Western food than Washoku, for example, many people eat bread in the morning. Washoku is Japanese traditional food and healthy food which are often used many copious fish, rice and seasonal vegetables. So, I am really proud of Washoku as Japanese people and I want Japanese people to eat more Washoku than Western food."
2020,"This news is so much wonderful for us!! It made me happy.I love Japanese food!These days we have lesser and lesser chances eating Japanese cuisine than before. Especially young people prefer to eat Western cuisine, for example hamburger, fried potatoes, fried chickens and Ramen. So I want them to eat Japanese cuisine on this occasion."
2021,"I was surprised that sleep plays an important role to live. I thought we sleep to rest our bodies and brains, but according to this article, the brain is always working. I learned the importance of sleep, so I think I should take enough sleep."
2022,"I felt so sad to hear the news because I am really looking forward to The Qatar 2022 World Cup. The World Cup is the most international soccer tournament held every four years. Host country have to make efforts to prepare in order to succeed it. Of course, host country have the duty that all thing must be prepared by 2022. However, Nepalese workers were dead because of bad condition. The government must take action quickly to solve the worker problem and reconsider the way to prepare it.. The real success of the World Cup is that not only host country but also any other countries can really enjoy it without sad accidents, in my opinion."
2023,"When I heard this news, I felt it is so difficult. This bill has two sides. One side, it protects the country's secrets. It means it protects us for danger from other countries. The other side, the government can hide informations that are inconvenient for them."
2024,"I felt so sad because I really respect him. I think that he is one of the greatest people in the world. He has achieved great things, for example, TRC. He is a person who has a strong sense of justice and he fought with ruling party in the cause of justice. Justice which depends on circumstances is not a justice, in my opinion. In that point, he could really take action for the justice. I admired him for his spirit and tolerance."
2025,"I was so happy to hear this news. Washoku is wonderful. Washoku draw out each charms with many ingredients to the maximum. It is so good for our health.By having been enrolled in a world heritage, I hope more people eat Washoku in the world."
2026,"I was so surprised to hear the news. This execution of Jang Song-Thaek will affect the stability and social cohesion of North Korea. We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. In Japan, this circumstance is not safety because North Korea is next to Japan and any other accidents in North Korea have some connection with Japan. This accident did not received front-page coverage, and so I think that Japan news medium should report the more Asia situation. Japanese people have to become sensitized to the situation in Asia, especially Korea, North Korea and China."
2027,I agree with your opinion. I think many companies and researchers spend money on research brain to find out the way to cure diseases. I hope the number of patients suffer from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease decrease.
2028,"I agree with this article. In Japan, the disaster often happens, for example, earthquake in Tokyo. We don't know the time when next big disaster will happen. We people in Japan must really consider the risk of second disaster. The best way is to remove nuclear plant without dangerous accidents. However, this problem is so difficult to solve that people in world have to consider new solution."
2029,I I agree with you. I'm afraid that we lost freedom and peace because of this bill. It is bad we cannot check government decision. I hope politicians use this law to improve Japan.
2030,"I'm sure technologies have been improved very much these days, but a drone, remotely piloted aircraft is still too early to actually use. Of course, if we can succeed in making perfectly safe airplanes controlled by machine, that's better. However in fact it is endangering many civilians' life now. Under this situation, to continue using drones is too risky for America's dignity. Although some might say America no longer has its dignity, I think America still takes big leadership in the world. I want American government to bravely stop using drones at once."
2031,"These reactions to the spying are just a simpler and more understandable way to justify a global shift out from under the control of the US. The near collapse of the global economy has created a concerted movement to almost ignore what is now widely seen as a corrupt and dysfunctional plutocracy. China's official position for the downturn is on record as the 'Triffin Dilemma', and that assessment is correct. It means that the US is systematically parasitic and detrimental to global development via abuse of the reserve currency status and via the IMF, WTO, and the World Bank. This allegation too is so clearly and mathematically sound that there is no defense or excuse that might repair relations. The US simply tried to manipulate the global economy unfairly in every possible way and the ROW is now responding with a united front."
2032,I don't think this news is such a big problem. Nothing would happen due to Yamamoto's action because we all know Japanese emperor is unable to speak out anything to politics. It is ordained clearly in Japan Constitution. So why do people make a bother about this? I cannot understand. Naturally it is a fact that Yamamoto did a not admirable action but that had almost no impact on actual politics.
2033,State Secrecy Bill was approved at the end against a lot of nations' opposition. Personally I think it was a good consequence though the law still has much room for the government's explanation and improvements. Such a big law has not been decided in the Diet these days so they should have courage to 'change'. It is natural that a number of people disagree with an innovation idea. A person or the government that can persuade those people with good faith does have a qualification to rule a country.
2034,"Relationships between Asian countries are too complicated so it is very difficult task for Mr Biden, America to deal with it. Visiting a lot of countries in Asia and making conversations with each top was great action itself, however, America is now a little bit losing its credit from the world so those visits did not influence enough so far. Each Asian country must think good relationship with America is necessary so America should keep in touch with Asian countries like Japan, China or Korea."
2035,"I agree with you.Of course, another countries foods good. However it was good a Japanese tradition was evaluated in the world.I am proud of it as a Japanese. I think that you were able to cook a delicious washoku."
2036,"I agree with your opinion.The North Korean diplomatic central figure was him so far.After he was dead, we were not able to expect an action of North Korea.Japan should not overlook their trifling action."
2037,"I think it is very difficult for brain to sleep because people use brain a lot. I was surprised at the effect of sleep. I didn't know to sleep make their brain clean. I will sleep more, and I want be clever."
2038,"Recently a lot of law were made, so I can't understand all law. But today Abe will make new law. If the law is very important, if people break promise, the law has no role. i think law should be made a promise."
2039,I think he was a one of the greatest men in the world. His name is known widely in the world. We lost great man. I'm so sad. We try to do anything like him. His death gave me motivation. I mourn the death of him.
2040,"I think that the secret low is necessary legislation, however, that the current proposal is not enough. In order to protect the national interest, protection of secret is important, on the one hand, it's right to know what we should also be emphasized. It should be prevent that infringing the rights of our knowledge,and to be abused the law. I believe strongly the need for third-party monitoring committee for this bill. Because I think this bill that we should be improved, I sympathize people opposed. I want the politicians to listen to public opinion all means."
2041,"Jang Song would have been determined to be a hindrance for the current power. I do not know whether he thought that the 'steal the regime', but because he had a track record and experience, it would have been regarded as dangerous elements. Anyway, the situation to decide things in power is not desirable. In addition, information manipulation is horrible,too. I wonder people of North Korea believe the reason for his downfall. I feel this news represents the unstable political situation. North Korea should be stable in good condition. However, it seems difficult in the current regime."
2042,"I did not have an idea like you until I read this comment, but I agree with your opinion. I think indeed, usually, such a fact should be hidden, too. If not research capacity of neighboring countries was adept, I think what you think is a very fact. And, I worry the action of North Korea ,too."
2043,"This news cheered us and made us take proud of Japanese culture. Washoku is composed of not only dishes of first-class Japanese restaurants, but also Japanese home dishes. They are so highly balanced in nutritional value and so delicious. However, these days, Japanese people have lesser Washoku than before. This is because Western-style food has penetrated in Japanese food culture. Especially, the so-called junk food is low in nutritional value and contains many fats; for example, hamburger, fried chicken, pizza, and pancake. Therefore, Japanese people have to preserve Washoku, the world-class traditional Japanese culture."
2044,"I agree with your opinion. To solve problems of this kind, independent organizations such like UN should impartially intermediate between immigrant countries and emigrant countries. Furthermore, they should sometimes interfere in emigrant countries where people have few jobs and government corrupted."
2045,"I disagree with your opinion. No matter what efforts we made, the war would never disappear. This is evident from the history. Unless we threw away the concepts of state and race, we would fight each other. Therefore, using drones should be banned because it makes more civilian casualties."
2046,"I agree with your opinion. Sleeping is more important than I thought. The same as you, I tend to stay up late so I don't have enough sleep. Therefore, in order to keep our heath and memory, we have to sleep in earlier time than now."
2047,"I disagree with your opinion. This law does not infringe our rights to access information. The contents that this bill specify as secrecy are related in only national defense. We don't need to know the information that this law restricts. There are nothing what the general public can do for national defense. If we throw away this bill for our rights to access information, we will endanger our country to let spies easily steal important information about national defense."
2048,"I agree with your opinion. After 3.11, Japanese foods are damaged by the rumors that they are polluted with radiation. This new can wipe away the rumors and make Washoku more famous. Washoku is one of the safest and healthiest cuisine in the world."
2049,"I am glad to see this news because I love Washoku than fast foods. Of course Pasta, Pizza, Ramen also very delicious, but Washoku has different taste something special. But I wonder how Washoku was known . I think Japanese foods cannot spread to the world. But I also think it should be more famous from now on."
2050,"I also think junk food shop are increasing but Washoku cannot be increasing. I expect Washoku will be famous under the influence of this news. Washoku is very delicious, so it will be loved by everyone in the near future. I am looking forward to....."
2051,"I did not know him very well. I heard his name in the class of social study. So when I heard this news, I do not think more things. But, now I think his death is a big loss for the world because there is not any person who change bad system like apartheid. We have to follow his example and make better world."
2052,I do not know him very well but I also want to admire him for his spirit and tolerance. I want to be a person who can fight with ruling party but it is very difficult because it means I also have to make a effort like him. And I need talent for it.
2053,"Forced labor under the bad conditions such as heat and no water is a heinous crime which one uses only his power. A rule by using one's power doesn't have legitimacy, so we should prohibit this kind of rule. However, I believe the huge arrangement of infrastructure for World Cup has a positive impact on a host country as a result. And I want to focus only on football at World Cup, tournament management should not be conspicuous."
2054,"I agree to ID1322's idea. Washoku is healthy and delicious. However, we eat western food almost every day. Washoku got the UNESCO heritage status, so it is good time for Japanese people to reconsider about the importance of Washoku."
2055,I pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was courageous to act in order to realize the world where anybody is equal.He challenged to eliminate racial discriminations. His activity was great and had a significant impact on the current peace. R.I.P.
2056,"In my opinion, State secret law should not be approved. I think this low make a bad situation because it means ruling party's secret are forgiven.If there is a lot of rules in the law, it will interpret what they like. So I think this law is bad for Japan's economy"
2057,"I agree with ID1305. I did not know his achievements in detail. However, everyone knows that he is great and he did a lot to solve racial discrimination problem. We have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination."
2058,"That is important point what is ID1321 said. We have a right to know about our country's information. Although, if we can have information at one's fingertips, and anything, that is also dangerous. So I agree with you making 'secret' clear is necessary."
2059,"I don't know whether Jang Song-Thaek was really bad person or not, because the central government of North Korea is corrupt. I think that not only Jang Song-Thaek but also other mandarin commit corruption. I guess Jang Song-Thaek was punished in order to suppress North Korea's bad reputation."
2060,I also think this is a difficult problem because information cannot be released. Both Japan's policy toward the United State and domestic politic are important. So we should think more about this law problem.
2061,I agree with ID1338. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.
2062,Nelson Mandela was a great person. We all have to mourn for him. To abolish racial discrimination takes an incredibly hard work and long time so most of us cannot believe or would not take some action by oneself to realize it though we all want the world without discrimination. I admire him for his resolution that he was willing to be arrested or in custody to achieve the big dream.
2063,"I agree to your opinion. If we lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. This bill threatens today's Japanese democracy system."
2064,"I think we should defend the territory of Japan-specific. It is important to know the true history and consider about the zone. However, the behavior of Japan or America is very crucial to the world peace because a big war might occur due to this problem.Therefore, the concerned countries should discuss carefully."
2065,"I do not know about this news and North Korea in detail either, however we should know them well for Japanese national interest. North Korea is the neighboring country for Japan and very dangerous."
2066,"I'm honored that Japanese traditional cuisine was designated to the United Nation's cultural heritage. That means washoku is getting extremely high status in the world and many people love washoku. In reality, I have never heard someone who does not like Japanese meal. It is super admirable thing. The strong point of washoku is that it perfectly and clearly reflects the noticeable change of the seasons, that is to say, freshness. However, unfortunately people in Japan currently have less time to eat washoku than before. They love American, French, Italian food. This phenomenon is strange to me."
2067,I agree with this opinion. I also don't want to my opinion be controlled by government. We should have right to know all information because we are the party of this country.
2068,"I agree with you. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. Also its central government have so many political scandal. I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention same as you. North Korea locates very close to Japan, so we have to pay attention to the North Korea's trend."
2069,I agree with this opinion. We should protect the culture of washoku because washoku is independent from other country's food culture.
2070,I was very surprised at the truth that brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. I think the mechanism in our body works really nicely.
2071,"I love Washoku, so this news made me happy. Washoku is becoming more and more popular worldwide,but in Japan,the original country,Washoku is becoming more and more unpopular. I heard that recent children don't like shoyu or dashi. This fact is so sad. Japanese should protect the culture of Washoku."
2072,"Now I am very fearful of North Korea. I cannot imagine the feeling of killing one of the nation's leaders. We don't know whether Jang song thaek actually made a plan of terrorism or he was corrupt in the politics. However, even if he was vicious, why did they make such an easy decision to execute him? To banish him out of the political circle was enough. A lot of countries in the world will suffer a serious loss due to his death because many of those countries maintained the relationship with North Korea by contacting with Jang song thaek."
2073,"Nelson Mandela is honorable person. Almost all of us hope the discrimination would disappear, but we can't take some action to solve any problem. To a grater or less degree we also all have prejudice. So we can't claim that discrimination is bad in public in big voice , which Nelson Mandela did."
2074,"I think Taro Yamamoto was so ignorance and the emperor Akihito's action symbolize the role of emperor in this country. Taro Yamamoto could find other ways to express his opinion, so I can't understand his action at all."
2075,I agree with this opinion. I want the researchers to continue research the connection between sleep and brain and utilize the result of the research.
2076,"I agree with this opinion. It is true that we should get more information to confront terrorism ,but the way should not violate the human rights . The US should take other way."
2077,"I was very surprised at the truth that such many civilian casualties hurt by drone strikes there were. Because we live in peaceful and quiet country, Japan, we tend to be ignorant about terrible matters in the world. In order to realize world peace, we must concern about incidents all over the world as widely as possible."
2078,"I think it is a serious problem. African migrants going to Italian island are increasing.And They go on a jam-packed board. It is danger. I think this accident relates it. And African migrants increasing has two problems. One, Italian population growth rate is rapidly increasing by them. Another, young Italian people has difficulty in catching occupations. So I think African countries and Italy should have the consultation and make some policies."
2079,The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on stability of North Korea regime.We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. We should take care of their acts.
2080,"Improvement of technologies by human-being is remarkable. Before I read this article, I was already sure that sleep takes a crucial role to live. Still researchers need to have such a scientific proof to make more progress. So, that research was important. Actually I don't know exactly about brain or cells but I can say the development of research about human body helps us keep healthy."
2081,"First of all, I mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. As a person in 21th century, we should strive more for making 'rainbow nation' that coexist with people of having a different skin color. He may live forever in our mind."
2082,I agree with you. Various Japanese foods are damaged and misunderstood by Fukushima nuclear crisis. So UNESCO heritage status cheers up Japanese and Japan economy and so on. I'm pleased it! And I want Japan to go to happy future.
2083,"I felt quite relieved to know A total of 155 survivors were rescued. However, I was worried about a further 200 people still missing. I hope they will be recovered soon. Moreover, I was sad to think about at least 111 people gone. In order not to cause such a tragedy again, countries all over the world should prepare to accept migrants urgently."
2084,"Whether he committed to trait or not , that something will happen in South Korea may be no doubt. South Korea is nearby Japan , so we must pay attention to its movement of future."
2085,"I was surprised to hear that. Although I understand the US claim that NSA's spying is a necessary part of their counter-terrorism strategy around world, they should know the border between good and not good ethically. Even if that act help government in some part, other problem will occur in other part as now. The goal we should head for is more basic part."
2086,"I agree with you in that It is a problem of every country. In order to make world where every people can live comfortably and happily, every country must try to support poor countries."
2087,"I think so! I reconsidered my sleep style by this article, too. We should take care of our health more! And you should get more sleep!"
2088,"I felt sad to read this article.Some times, it is said that FIFA World Cup is the symbol as world's peace and friendship. In spite of this, the situation is the reverse. In order to make FIFA World Cup fun for every one, we should change this situation. For this, first thing we can do is knowing more problem."
2089,"''I think it is the accident only in movie and comics' , this attracted me! I think so! It must not have occurred as your reaction. It is a serious problem has various meanings. From now on, it is on my mind!"
2090,I sympathized your opinion about the gap of guilty feeling between killing by missile and that by knife. Attacks from the sky reminds me of game.
2091,"I can't agree your opinion in all point. In fact, not only Japan but other country need state secret law to certain degree. 21th century is information era. Information is power or force of each country. So information is very important. But it is in terms of a nation. In terms of people, oppressive law as Japan's is not good clearly and not appropriate."
2092,"I agree with you. Taro Yamamoto lacks a sense of responsibility as a member of the Diet, lawmaker."
2093,"I agree with your opinion. Kim Jong Un's actions are difficult to anticipate. So we have to cooperate with other countries such as America and South Korea. And it is also important to restrain the nation which have the possibility of giving help to keep the nondemocratic political system. If this could be happen, North Korea will have no choice but to accept a proposal of conference."
2094,I disagree with your opinion. This law is intended to protect Japan from the foreign country. The concrete content should be decided by addition. This law is better than before one.
2095,"I think we cannot say unconditionally that spying is a bad action. Spying is sometimes necessary for nations' security in the international society. It is true that spying might involve unrelated person, but I think spies of nations would not leak the information they get unreasonably."
2096,I agree with you. Sleep is important for our health. I understand concrete device of the sleep.We should take sleep more.
2097,"The bill could suppress the freedom of speech and publish.It is said that the mass media play a significant role in monitoring the government and providing important information about politics to people.So if this bill will be more strengthened,the mass media will lose its role and we Japanese people will lose our rights to know.According to the survey conducted by Mainichi Shimbun,59% of Japanese people opposed to the bill.The ruling party must listen to the voice of citizens much more carefully."
2098,"It is natural that the drone strikes violate international law,I suppose. It's like the atomic bombs that were dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and ,to put it in an extreme way, the simultaneous terrorism that attacked America in 2001.Citizens of countries attacked by drone strikes didn't know when it would be dropped.It is very shameful that the country that suffered the sorrows of indiscriminate killing became an indiscriminate killer."
2099,"I agree with you.Of course, I hope humans stop to war and stop to make arms. However I think that a weapon will not disappear. The people will say, 'it is for peace'."
2100,I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world. We should pay attention to the handling.
2101,"I think that this is so big and nice news for Japan. Japanese cuisine is losing its confidence because of the nuclear crisis. And Japanese taste is better than European one. I feel that 'washoku' becomes more famous. So, I expect the UNESCO heritage status to get back the respect to washoku."
2102,"I agree with you. America's action this time brought distrust in the world. It is easy to lose the trust, but it is not easily restored. The United States must make much efforts from now on."
2103,When I first read this title I was very surprised because I believed that sleep make our brain only take a rest.And the fact that toxin is generated in our brains everyday also astonished me. The article was very interesting and at the same time made me want to know the negative aspects of sleep
2104,"Most migrations are attributed to the poor living standard in migrants' country.In order to solve this problem,all the European countries should unite and endeavor to improve it.It doesn't matter which European country is most responsible for it."
2105,"I partly agree with your idea. Maybe the UNESCO heritage status gives back Japanese cuisine credit but Japanese people have to keep working. Japanese people themselves do not eat or like washoku recently, instead they often eat other countries' food."
2106,"I was really surprised about this news. This is because I can't imagine that thousands of migrants tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea to Europe, and have died many times. Also this news make me sad for the immigrants. I think that kind of immigrants are very serious problem. So I think countries should responsible for this problems."
2107,I was really surprised by this article and I found it is interesting. Now I know sleeping is important to keep ourselves healthy. I don't think I get enough sleep everyday but I should take longer sleep.
2108,"I was really surprised and felt sad when I read this news. I think that the responsibility of this tragedy doesn't belong to Italy, European countries and any European organization. But there should be something that they can do for the poor people. It must help to solve these problems."
2109,I felt so sad to hear this news. This is because World Cup is the symbol of world's peace and friend ship. Also a lot of people are looking forward it. I think one of the problem about it is the luck of freedom. I think human rights should be protected. So that we should try to change the situation now.
2110,I'm interested in this news. This is because I don't think drone strikes make world's peace. Also I fear about it will violent international law. Also the users of drones may not feel the sense of killing people. It is really dangerous for human moral. so that I want US government will stop to use drones.
2111,"Is it good for people to use drone strikes? I think this is a really difficult question and I don't think there is a right answer for that. I always feel really complicated when I hear a news or a paradoxical problem related to US military. Drone strikes can kill the people who is innocent, so I think it is not good for them to use drone strikes. I know it will be hard but I want American government to stop using it once."
2112,I realized the importance of sleeping.I knew that the lack of sleeping lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in this article. I really thought I should sleep enough to work the 'waste removal system' and living a long life!
2113,"I agree with your opinion that we have to get knowledge about washoku . In the future I want to study abroad, so I think I have better get knowledge about it before going abroad."
2114,"I was really surprised to hear this news. This is because US used the way of spying. I know counter terrorism is a very serious problem for US, but use the way of spy is not good way and it's dishonest. I can understand US's think but, they need to think other way to counter terrorism"
2115,"I think it is amazing that the Japanese traditional cuisine has been added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. And I think it is a great news for us. This would make washoku more famous and more and more people in the world will have some interest and they will try them. A lot more people have western food at home now in Japan, but we should keep our traditional Japanese food too."
2116,I agree with his opinion. It is true that 'there are especially in Japan a lot of spies and the threat of the terrorism is growing.'They will be bigger enemies than attacking the freedom of the citizens.
2117,"I think Japanese government should remove away all nuclear plant in Japan. This is because if a huge earthquake or Tsunami like 3.11 came again, Japan are not be able to revival again. I know there are a lot of reasons to government cannot remove away, but Japan should think more seriously about nations."
2118,"I always feel fearful when I read the article of foreign country. I never see the word 'kill' or 'die'. I don't understand about a foreign situation, but I want foreign country be peace like Japan."
2119,"I know your feelings, because I was also shocked when I heard this news . I know him well because I learned about him in the English class and in the history class, and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man."
2120,I agree. Washoku is very beautiful. But western food is almost beautiful too. Both food's difference is healthiness. Western food is not healthy. Almost that is high fat. Washoku have many good points.
2121,I think the law is needed for Japan today. This bill will help not to leak the important information related to national defense. And also this bill can improve the international relation between Japan and allies. Of cause I know that this bill has some problems but I think anything is better than none.
2122,"This discovery of US's bugging lessens Europe's trusts in US. It is said that the Germany are sensitive to wiretapping and bugging because they were bugged and suppressed in ideology and speech by the East Germany government. Although spying is common in developed countries, infringing individual rights is unacceptable. Therefore, developed countries have to set a high value on the balance between privacy prevention and spying."
2123,I was really surprise to hear this news. This is because I didn't know the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. Also after I read this news I realized sleep is very important for us. I love sleeping so that I'm really happy to sleep and work that system and living long and healthy life!!!
2124,"I wonder when the situation in Fukushima will be recovered. There are too many problems there. Not only the direct damage of the earthquake and tsunami but also the accident of the nuclear power plants, and the problem of cleaning the radioactive materials are really serious. The actor of the operation , TEPCO has problems in itself too. Hiding the information, its optimistic but not practical point of view, the speed of the action is too dull, and so on. As long as the actor remains dull and fool the situation won't be improved."
2125,"I disagree with you because nuclear plant is necessary for our country. Indeed it's very dangerous when disaster happens, but it also supports Japan's economy strongly. So in my opinion,Japan should stop old and dangerous ones and make more durable plants as soon as possible."
2126,"I totally agree with your opinion, because this law can limit our freedom. As you say, press freedom and freedom of thought are very important, so we should protect these freedoms by objecting to this law."
2127,"I do not agree with your opinion. You say 'Hollywood stars have not privacy because of paparazzi.' This is TRUE of big stars.However,we are normal people,not big stars. You have to think about this problem from the point of our view. There are not only stars in U.S."
2128,I was also surprised to read this article. I also thought sleeping enough time is only to rest my body. So I thought I did not need to sleep long times but it was wrong. I wonder why sleeping so long times links early death.
2129,"I'm glad to hear this news. I really like Japanese foods, so I want all over the world know this taste and flavor. Of course Japanese foods are healthy, good for human body. So now this news made Japanese food signalize, I'm happy."
2130,I think so too. He had big influence all over the world not only black people but white people. But he was not a special person. He was a normal people. All of black people are like him.
2131,"White do you think more important, our freedom or security? I think security is more important. The law will save our security. So I agree with it."
2132,"I agree with your opinion. US is the one of the most powerful nation,so US ought to consider world peace. However, these weapons may go out of control.They are dangerous weapons for us."
2133,"I also agree with you. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. Now he had passed away, but the people in South Africa should face the problems they have now and they should keep trying to make the better country for themselves."
2134,"I like your idea. Although it is difficult for us to solve the migrants' problem, there are still some ways that developed countries can do. One of it may be the cooperation between Europe and Africa."
2135,"White do you think more important, our freedom or security? I think security is more important. The law will save our security. So I agree with it."
2136,"I agree with you. This news justified my sleep. If we do not have enough sleep, our brain cannot work and not good for our health. However, you cannot justify your tardy!"
2137,"I feel the same way , because I don't have much time to sleep these days.Like you, my body may have lots of toxins, so I should improve my life style and have enough sleep ."
2138,"In fact, in information age, we have to treat abundant information. It is same to a nation.So important information needs protection.But person's privacy is equal to a nation in terms of importance. In conclusion, the border is needed."
2139,I am glad to see this news. Washoku got the UNESCO heritage because WASHOKU is creativity. This news means world people know great Japanese food. I am proud of it as a Japanese. I want to that people more eat WASHOKU.
2140,I agree with your opinion. We should oversee their way to use it
2141,"There are various opinions against Mandela. However I think he is a honorable man.The fact that he fought against discrimination and that he made the first step to change South Africa is admirable. We must learn from him, I think. We must learn the spirit to fight against injustice even in a severe situation. However I don't think fighting or protesting is the only way to deal with severe situation, I highly evaluate his way of living."
2142,I was shocked by this news. I think there're many other case like this and are never able to disappear. We have to face that we are always near the catastrophe of the war or natural disaster.
2143,I agree with you. I especially like the sentence 'there is not 100% safety in the real world'. That is so true there won't be the completely safe place in the world. But we should keep trying to create better world.
2144,I agree with the idea that washoku is wonderful. I like washoku very much too. I having eaten washoku everyday since I was a child. I think we should protect this culture.
2145,"Yes, I agree with you. I'm also proud of this news. You should have more Japanese food! That is good for you to keep your healthy."
2146,"I think it is very difficult problem and much to be discussed. For sure,USA may violate the international law,but also there're no other means to defeat the terrorism."
2147,"He wants to say that his power is great,because there is rumor around the world that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated."
2148,"I agree with you.although fast-foods are convenient and instant,they are too harmful for our health.And with fast-foods,we can't spend dinner time with our family. We Japanese should eat 'washoku' more and spread it to the world."
2149,"I did not know this news and I was surprised at it. I reconfirm that North Korea is so dangerous. If the same thing happened in Japan, I can not live comfortably."
2150,"Yeah I think so too. Japan certainly lacks security against foreign threat or terrorism. The opinion which only focuses on the violation of our freedom, bad point of the bill, is not practical. However explanation against the people and agreements from the people are important,should not be ignored."
2151,"I agree with you. Counter-terrorism is important for the U.S. indeed. However, wire tapping is against morals. This tapping may make the relation between the U.S. and Germany worse. However, in order to prevent terrorism, the U.S. and Germany should corporate."
2152,"I agree with you. I also think washoku is really healthy and good for our body too. It includes a lot of seasonal vegetables, fish and rice. We should keep our traditional food to the next generation."
2153,"I don't agree with this idea. To be sure, terrorism is growing, but deliberation time is too short. It is possible that government became terrorist if they don't deliberate more time."
2154,I am shocked by this article. Of course I knew that sleeping is vital for the health and shortage of sleep does harm to health. But I did not know shortage of health led to diseases. I decided to review my sleeping style with notice.
2155,We had no time to judge whether this law is good one or not. This can be lack of democracy.
2156,I agree with your opinion that the US should know better than to do such spying action.The reason why I feel so is that it is not good for the US to lose trust from the foreign country by spying other countries' leaders.So I think the US should stop their spying .
2157,This sounds like Japan is going back to the war-time.
2158,"I think that Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest person over the world. His speech and action changed South Africa. I was so surprised that he had been taken into custody to fight against apartheid. Therefore, I was shocked by his death."
2159,I think this law can make a good influence to the country too. It is true that the law will limit our freedom. But still there are some good point for the Japanese government and other countries. I even thought it was strange that the Japan didn't have such law as we developed.
2160,"Maybe I remember this news was on the front page and Japan news media broadcast it a lot. I think Japanese media covers enough news in other Asian countries which is related to Japan politics, economy, environment and so on. If you want to get more information about adjacent countries, you should be more willing to get them. You can find them anywhere in the Internet."
2161,I was very surprised to read this article because I did not know UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). It is too cruel because civilians never defend from such attacks. I also think Obama doing a good work but I wonder why a United Nations cannot move more. A United Nations should also take against the terrorism.
2162,"Though I admit that your opinion is right for the point of national defence, but I still think this bill will cause more harm than good."
2163,"I think it is important for America to apologize to Germany too. If you want to be put others' trust in you, apology could be the best way. America cannot be a influential countries in the world without the good relationship with developed countries especially European countries, so apology is needed to make things better."
2164,"Every time I read such news, I think 'China talk nonsense again,but is it true that Japanese politicians claim to the world?' Japanese politician always claims that despite China doesn't open the certain evidence, they claim that this area belongs to China. Of course I agree this, but Chinese politicians may also think 'Japan talks nonsense again.' Getting along well with neighboring countries is really difficult."
2165,"I think that the World Cup can make one's country's economy better. However, cases like this news often happens. Host country must finish preparation of facilities which are needed to hold soccer event,but sometimes it is difficult to do it for host country itself. Therefore, FIFA should give money or other things so that workers can work in safe conditions."
2166,"I don't think so. I think UN should not make an effort to solve this problem but THE African countries should do. Certainly, UN have to work together. But The African countries must play the main role to solve this problem."
2167,"I was agree with TEPCO when I read The article. Of course I don't expect TEPCO and its employees, so I'm OK if they get too much salary. But I want them to realize they can rob a lot of life and our health. So, I never want them such a trouble again."
2168,"This behave seems to be misled by other countries. Recently , this kind of matter sometimes happens. In the future , technology can cause conflict and war and so on , I think."
2169,"This was so shocking. We many Japanese are rich that we can live with no need of change of situations around us. But on other sides of the world, some people have to change something to live on, disregarding danger. But I think the migrants themselves are responsible for this tragedy because no one wouldn't have forced them to take the dangerous journey."
2170,I was really surprised by this news. The US used the spying to counter terrorism. But I don't think this is a good way to do that and I think they should find another way.
2171,"I agree with the state secret bill. A lot of people in Japan fear terrorism. If important information leak, possibility of terrorism will get higher. Therefore, I think the state secret bill which protect terrorism should be carried out."
2172,I think so. I want to keep peace without new weapons. I don't agree with Obama's policy.
2173,"I have read about him only in textbooks of History, but I know that he had fought for his brotherhoods. May his spirit stay in the land of South Africa."
2174,It's not 'agree'. I wanted to write 'angry'.
2175,"Yeah I agree with you. This kind of problem is not simply about justice or people's right or something like that. It is true that those weapons are cruel, cowardice, savage. It really sucks. But the fact that the US are the leader to fight terrorism and the US uses those weapons to counter terrorism are unshakable. To change this situation other countries should gain power in the counter-terrorism field and try to regulate or supervise the abuse of those weapons by the US."
2176,I agree with you.mass media make a great fuss about this law.This law is necessary to protect secret information of military.But they said as if this law were made to information of the government.
2177,"I am proud of the news, even though I don't really like the taste of Japanese traditional food."
2178,"I'm very glad and proud of this news because we should treasure Washoku as our own culture.For this,in my opinion,for example,there should be the washoku museum or TV program about washoku and there will be a lot of interest in washoku."
2179,"I agree with you. We have to find better way to solve this problem. This problem is very difficult, but we should not compromise to die many people. We have to think more and more."
2180,"Nelson Mandela is one of the most nice person of this world for me. He has really strong passionate, I have been respected him since when I learn about him at junior high school. When I read this topic I was really surprised, because he had been in prison for as many as 27 years! I can't believe that, and I moved his life."
2181,"Generally , we think Qatar is the rich country. So , this news surprises at me. I think the government should bridge the gap between the rich and the poor."
2182,"I think so, too.The man cannot help feeling the direct attack is heavy and the indirect attack is light.Because the man cannot feel indirect event as heavy accident. So we should more think about this indirect war."
2183,"I agree with your idea. I never know about Mandela up till now, however I learned about him in history class in the other day. He is very great person! I want to be man like him."
2184,I agree with you.European countries should support African.
2185,I also think it is a difficult problem to solve and I don't think there is an answer.
2186,"I agree with your opinion because I believe there must be a way to settle this problem without fighting.I don't want anyone to be killed or injured because of drone attacks.Because of these reasons, I'm against the use of drones."
2187,I became too. I thought to sleep make us more clever. If we don't sleep enough we will not be clever. So I want to sleep more. Let's sleep more.
2188,I agree with you. I also think washoku keep human health. I want this news to trigger increasing of valuation of washoku from other countries.
2189,"I agree with you. Japanese women live an average of 80 years. I think Japanese such long life span related to Washoku. We take less oil, and much vegetable. My grandmother used to make washoku for me before her death. I like her Washoku and want to eat her Washoku again."
2190,"I'm agree with you. I like washoku so much too. In addition, I want more foreigner washoku. So what washoku adds the United Nation's cultural heritage list is good thing for me."
2191,"I strongly agree with this new law. I don't say the opposition is wrong,but I think they can't think wisely. This new law is not completely good but this is better than older one."
2192,"This news shows that Kim Jong-un tries to make North Korea more despotic. Although, even up to now, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il sometimes executed some politicians for their treasonable acts, they never punished their relatives because North Korean was a Confucian country. However, Kim Jong-un killed Jang Song-thaek, his uncle-in-law, and furthermore, abused him by calling him 'a brutal ambitious traitor' and 'lesser than dogs'. The detailed reasons why he was punished is not clear, but the certain fact that this news shows is that North Korea is becoming a dangerous despotic country and increasing military strength."
2193,"I agree with you. Washoku's seasoning is great. Using seasoning ingredients cost low and they are really good taste. As a proud of Japan, I want cooks make great washoku."
2194,"I can't agree with the secret law. This is because I fear it gonna be limits of freedom. This law would be allow the government to keep away from important information, so that we are not able to make a political decision. I think this situation is not good for nation and it will limit the human rights. So that I think Mr. Abe should think about this once again!"
2195,I agree with you. It is difficult to make one answer. We should think more deeply about this problem.
2196,"I am ashamed of my ignorance of history. I have heard about him a couple of times, but I didn't really know about him actually. Since he died, I came to notice how great person he is that he made an effort to stop discrimination at the time when that kind of insistence is disliked. From now, I want to study about not only him but also people who have done great things in the past. Then I want to be the person who can explain amazing stories of historical people to my future children."
2197,"I don't sleep well, too. My sleep is very irregular. So I should change my sleep cycle for future myself."
2198,"China and Japan have a lot of confrontations such as history, political systems and so on. However both countries are so near that I think it is necessary for us to avoid armed clash. In order to achieve this, conference between China and Japan are needed. This conference must be of value because it affects the result of the TPP."
2199,I agree with you. I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.
2200,"Yes, I agree with you, and I also haven't heard brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins!! That is amazing! So we should make time to sleep much more."
2201,"After I read this article, I thought Taro Yamamoto should have acted more carefully as a law maker. I can understand the feeling that he wanted to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. But he should not have done that. I"
2202,Can we interfere other nation's domestic politics when it is clear that its leader cannot govern the country properly? I think it is one of the discussion-provoking points of international law and politics.
2203,"I think so too.however busy you are,you should sleep property time.And I also want to get more information about toxins.What kind of toxins it is? How to remove it ?And,How long we should take hours of sleep?"
2204,"If this bill is allowed, how can we save our life from nuclear threats?? I think this new bill must be the thereat for Japan because I don't think Japan has enough experiment to protest from other country's invading. So I don't agree with this decision."
2205,"I agree with you. The more we know about brain, the more we live comfortably. Therefore, I want to know about brain's function."
2206,"I disagree with you. Once we he lose press freedom and freedom of thought even once, we cannot take them back forever. We cannot say what we want to say same as 'Toshokan Senso'"
2207,"I'm very proud to hear this news, this is because Japanese Washoku is great tradition of Japan and it should be protected. So that if it could get UNESCO status, this is really good status for Japan and also good for protect it. Also with this status, Japanese people's minds for Washoku will more strict and it will improve. So that I'm so happy with this news."
2208,I think so too. People decide the law in very short time. It will make Japan bad. Because the law is not thinking deeply. I think Abe should think more.
2209,Either did I understand what actually happened in North Korea and why. It's really confusing.
2210,"This action greatly affect the future of Japan. So , the best attention should be paid to complete this goal."
2211,"I think so, too. This bill is not clear about definition of secret. So,this bill must be passed."
2212,"North Korea is not democratic country, so it is useless to criticise the country unless its political system changes. However,achieving this is very difficult. So democratic countries should cooperate and do economic sanctions. If these countries do that,North Korea may collapse or follow our direction and change political system."
2213,"I was very shocked by this news. Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest people in 20th century,I think. His bravery and decision was second to none. I hope South Africa become more developed."
2214,"I do not think Jang Song-thaek was killed by his nephew. The central government of North Korea have so many corruptions. Jang Song-thaek possessed powerful authority,so I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention not by Kim Jong Un."
2215,This news article reminded me of the female workers in the time from Meiji to Showa era. They also worked in severe conditions and low wages to help their family's lives. So I'm so shocked and surprised at this news because I hardly have thought that the problems like this are still taking place now in 21 century. I hope this horrible situation would improve as soon as possible.
2216,"I was surprised to hear this news, because Kim Jong Un killed his own uncle. This story is like in the age of wars. In japan,a long time ago, there were struggle for power among the family. I knew again how outdated North Korea is!!"
2217,I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I wish to be found the point of compromise between 'military' and 'civilian safety'.
2218,"I was very surprised at this news. I really think North Korea is dangerous because if Jang Song-Thaek is a really bad person, I will never kill blood relative person. And I feel that there is a lot of person who does an injustice in North Korea. I want to why."
2219,"The news can potentially happen every countries in Europe. There are so many migrants in the area, so this is high time started to discuss the problems about migrants. I think countries should accept them because a country isn't for the natives of a country."
2220,I think so too!! All African people doesn't want to move to European Countries . So they must accept Africans.
2221,"I agree with your idea, this is because I think the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought too. I think the North Korea government is hard dictatorship. I think it is very serious problem and we need to think more seriously."
2222,I learned the same thing. I thought it is just to be tired if we can't sleep. But I learned it by reading this article. So I will sleep well.
2223,"I didn't know this news details. However,when I researched about this news in the other day, I was very surprised. I think that it is a bad thing which he kills key person in government. I hope North Korea become peace country."
2224,I disagree with you. Because I think it is difficult to decide which is wrong. The important thing is not deciding wrong but searching best solution.
2225,I agree with your opinion. I think that we should have consciousness of murder not to be cruel murderer.
2226,"When I know this topic first, to tell the truth, I can't understand the real meaning of this law. I hope this law will work for making good our nation. But hearing the public opinion, new law is as the regulation of our statement. If it is necessary for protecting our country, I don't want Japan to pick us up the right of free to speak."
2227,"I think so too. Because we are Japanese, we should make it important to eat Japanese food and protect Japanese culture."
2228,"I disagree with you.Of course there are no war,drone aren't used.But in actually,the war never ending and drone was needed.So the most argent task is eliminate sad civilians killed by drone.America should stop the using of drone immediately."
2229,"I agree with you. This bill should be passes now.In Japan, differing from the US, a public information act is not established. So in Japan, first, a public information act should be established."
2230,I also think it is difficult problem to be discussed. But I want foreign country to move peace.
2231,I agree with your idea. This is because we should more respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. I think for this he is really great person and his characteristic is special.
2232,"I am interested to read your comments. It is excellent that you have decided to sleep as long as possible especially when we have exams. I want to study beforehand so that I can sleep enough through exam weeks, like you have said. However, it is difficult for me to do that as I usually study just before the exams, because I do not feel like studying when exams are not coming up soon. It's not good, is it?"
2233,"I agree with you. Why we had wanted democracy so long time, we are about to break our country's security now? We must think this problem first."
2234,"I agree with your opinion. before read this article,I didn't think sleep is important .however I learned sleep is important. so I take a lot of sleep from now"
2235,I agree with you. I am afraid of North Korea. I cannot forget the news that All of North Korean were crying when Kim Jong Il died. I don't want to visit that country.
2236,I agree with you. He is one of the greatest person in the world. I think that his death is a great loss.
2237,"I was surprised at the news too. I thought that the brain is sleeping when my body was sleeping. After now, I want to treat carefully about my brain."
2238,"I agree with your opinion . It is true that drone is useful. However people can kill human easily. so, I think we should deracinate drone as soon as quickly."
2239,"I think so too. Rescue workers did very good things. The news was very sad news, but I think very good that many people could be survived."
2240,"We have the right to all the knowledge what our government do. However, state secret law can take our right. I think it's wrong thing. So I disagree with this law. The government hide some information, I can't trust them."
2241,"US should terminate thing like this. they always stimulate other countries and lead to war. If this occurred, the world would be more peaceful."
2242,"When I read this headline,It gave me big shocking. Before I know this topic, my image for World Cup is only enjoying the playing the soccer. But actually it is not true. Behind people's joy, many poor people are forced to work at bad situation. I think we should be hold World Cup with the way everyone is happy."
2243,"I agree with your opinion. Because there was harmful rumors, I am glad if this incident become the opportunity that gather attention Japanese food even food produced in Japan. Now, Western is on the rise in Japan, but the Japanese food shop will be increase."
2244,"When I read this article, I feel really sad.We can always live our lives in confortable.So we may not imagine this condition correctly.But for them urgent action is necessary. Supply without breaking their life style is important."
2245,"When I read this news story, I was afraid of the collapse of diplomatic relations among China, Korea and Japan. Because the ADIZ covers islands claimed and controlled by Japan, and a submerged rock claimed by South Korea. I want to them to maintain friendly relations whether Washington has taken Japan's side or not."
2246,I agree with your opinion. This bill could be applied illegally because its content is too vague. Everything has both good and bad points. All we need is to understand both sides and to consider what we should do. I believe that the country where people cannot say what they want to say is not a democratic country.
2247,"I agree with you because spying is unethical behave. To protect terrorism , US should more pay attention to behavior not doing this kind oh thing."
2248,"I think so ,too. But, on the other hand, I think that to protect secrets and national interest is necessary. So, I want politician to improve this low."
2249,I totally agree with you.
2250,Nelson Mandela is great person. I work part-time at Fuji TV and I watched many news of his death. I learned what he did. A lot of dignitary from the world came to his memorial ceremony. It shows how great he is. May his soul rest in peace.
2251,I agree with you. This crisis is very important not only for Italy but also the other nations including Japan. Migrants is one of the biggest problem in the world. We should think this problem again.
2252,"I disagree with her opinion because the new law may have the risk which is that the government control the important information. However, at the same time, I respect her opinion because I can understand her reason. In this way, this is a difficult issue. I don't hope the government will be despotic."
2253,I disagree with your opinion. This news is not perfect happy news. It is also convey the message to us that the Japanese cuisine is becoming extinct now.
2254,"I disagree with your opinion. It is true that this law is necessary to defence country. However this law regulation in very wide range.So, I think we should limit this law strictly."
2255,"I can't totally agree with you. It includes the danger of vague definition. However, this law could help improve national security as well."
2256,I agree with you. We should respect him because he abolished racial discrimination.
2257,"This is very glad news for people all over the world. Fukushima nuclear plants have many risks now. For example, typhoon, rain, tsunami, other earthquake and so on. We need many measures for safeness. We must not consider about money. I think that safeness is most important."
2258,"I agree with you. I respect rescue workers, because they saved a lot of life not only in this case. Therefore, I want to support them."
2259,"I agree with your opinion.And I also think that US should change their way for terrorism.If the way is not the way it doesn't hurt other people,it is impossible to eliminate the danger or the battle in the world."
2260,"The news of America's spy include this article made me scared. NSA spy to all of the world. By spying, they get plenty of information. Japan is included of their target. It means they may listen to our phone conversation or read e-mail. If so, I feel so bad."
2261,I think long sleep is not bad thing. But hear too long sleep is not good for your health. So you should keep it in mind.
2262,A lot of people must prayed that Nelson Mandela would not die. He saved many people. He made many people be smile. He brought happiness to everywhere. He is a great person. I respect him forever.
2263,I totally agree with you. I think it must be prohibited to use drones.
2264,"I agree with your opinion that spying is unpleasant action. I think the US should have protected own, with another way. I think that the state do such a thing may drive negatively to the public. This action will make the world to worse because country may have doubt to other countries."
2265,"I don't think so. I think that it cannot help the USA using drone strikes. It is true that drones kill a lot of people. However, they don't commit war crimes. If the USA throw many soldiers into battlefields, a lot of soldiers would die and commit war crimes. Drones prevent those things. We cannot criticize drones simply."
2266,"I feel very sad. I like to see FIFA World Cup very much. Word Cup is very good event for me. But I don't agree to hold World Cup in Qatar. I want to change the host country, for example Japan!"
2267,"This news gave us big shock. I think that the diplomacy is made by the trust between countries. So this matter undermined the confidence for America around the world, especially Germany.I want U.S to reflect on his actions. And never do such as thing."
2268,"I agree with you. Whether immigrants is good for the country or not, they must do something to help immigrants. Because it is natural to help other people."
2269,"I agree with you. Washoku embody Japanese culture. Japanese love the seasonal thing, for example the food or the plant. Now is the time to rethink our culture and Washoku."
2270,"I feel sad and heave a sigh.I can't believe that such a terrible accident happened some times.I think the accident like this time will happen in the future.To prevent it,it is necessary that people make the good relationships between Europe and Africa."
2271,"I disagree with you. Because I think that this law is not dangerous for Japanese people. But this law is dangerous for Japan. However, the country is consist of people. The profit of people should take first priority. So, country should not lie and have a secret to people."
2272,"I disagree with you. South Korea is the country dominated by the dictator. This kind of country , kill one's relative is usual I think."
2273,I was very surprised to read it.And I think it is too difficult to decide the justice about them.Because we do not know what we should consider as important.
2274,I agree with you. Japanese-style food is Japan's representative.Japanese-style food is popular for overseas people. So Japanese government should advertise Japanese-style food for gathering tourists.
2275,I agree with you. But the technology has become already the cause of conflict or war. So we should pay more attention to this kind of news. This matters to Japan as well.
2276,"I disagree with you. Because if people of a lot of countries live together, we can understand a lot of cultures. Let's live with various people"
2277,My cousins lived in Fukushima at that time happened 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Their house is located very near the nuclear power plants so they were forced to leave their house. And they can't come back here. They think we can never come back and live in our house. I don't want to happen such as tragedy forever. So this news is very happy for me.
2278,"I agree with your opinion.I think many people say their thoughts,making the thing which happens now and then basis of their idea.I really think it is too selfish.We should think more about the support for Fukushima people."
2279,"I have the same opinion. I knew that it is useful to fix the memory.However,I don't know this effect of sleeping. After I reading thin article, I decided that I would take more sleep for my health."
2280,"when Fukushima earthquake happened, a lot of radiation fluid in the sea,and it continue leaking even now. However, 3years passed, people forget about nuclear plants. We should more consider about our country's environment."
2281,"I disagree with your idea. Because if this law pass, the government can hide some information they don't want to say to citizen. For example, they can hide about Fukushima radiation. This information is related our health. If we could not get this, we cannot do anything. So this law should not be passed."
2282,"I agree with this comment because I also think the emperor is quite neutral. Even though I could understand Yamamoto's thought, it was a thoughtless act. According to the media, we can know how the emperor is considerate of Tohoku people. Moreover, there is the rule that the emperor shouldn't be involved in the government. If he break the rule, it will caused a lot of criticism from the world. So, I thought the action of the emperor Akihito was really great."
2283,I disagree with you because we depended on nuclear before the accident in Fukushima.
2284,"When I read this news,I think that this law may get rid of rights from us.We have rights.And we are free! And I have the right that I should know about information of the government.So I hope this law will disappear in the future."
2285,"I think so. I respected him very much. It is true that even if you have purpose like him, it is rare that you act as he did. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century, too. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength."
2286,"I have same thought as you. To get sleep is more important than I think. It relate to our health. Now I often sleep at 2am, I know this is bad for my body. So I'll try to sleep more earlier."
2287,"China is the growing for these years and has the big power and influence for Asia. And it always wants the resources. So it insists nearly countries, Korea, Japan and Taiwan, on extending its territory. To tell the truth, I think China's insistence is little unreasonable. Hoping not fighting territory each other in near future."
2288,"We should have culture depend on our country.It isn't same.So we consider our culture as important and love Washoku.They lead keep our culture,I think."
2289,I think so. America want to be a ''hero''. But I think America should consider not only American life but also other countries' people's life!
2290,"I agree with you generally.However,we can't denounce the migrants.I think they are poor and get out of the situation,but they should take another way."
2291,I disagree with you. I think drone strikes are necessary for us. Because drone strikes will defence our country. But we don't use it to attack country. Drone strikes are necessary for us!!!!!
2292,I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However I was surprised to hear that Everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. I think he had influence on all over the world and Nelson Mandela is the one of the best politicians of all the times.
2293,"I was not surprised when I read this article because I had already known this news.I have known him by studying world history.By being these person like him,now we can live in the peaceful world.I hope the South Africa more develop and prosper.I respect him strongly and forever."
2294,"You are so good student! I'm little surprised you at sleeping 7 hours every day. My sleep is often 3~4 hours. I didn't know sleep clean the brain, either. So I'll follow you to sleep more."
2295,"I think so.Japanese media should report more information about world like this,but it's also important that we get news by ourselves from foreign media."
2297,"I think our privacy should keep,also the chancellor.Surely,the information about other countries.But A country does not have the right which invade individual privacy,I think."
2298,"Your dream attract me. I think so that journalist should tell information to everyone. For it, I oppose to stating the secret law, too."
2299,"I agree with you! This news is very very great happening! Washoku is wonderful cuisine, healthy, beautiful color and seasonal materials. I want washoku to spread more and more famous around the world,too."
2300,"I agree with you. This problem is so complicated. US have to use drone to save the lives of their people. It is not easy for US to dispose the weapons. To dispose it, they have to end the war."
2301,"I disagree with your opinion. Emperor Akihito is top of Japan so we must have the respect due to his superiors. However, Yamamoto's action is a breach of etiquette. Therefore, it is natural that Mr.Yamamoto is blamed."
2302,"Enough sleep is essential for our health,but the time we start to sleep is also important, I think.I want to sleep before or behind 0 am."
2303,I know too. He is very popular person all over the world. I want to be him. I want to be person written on textbook.
2304,"I was very surprised at contents of this news. We repeat same mistakes many times and have to solve this issue. In any case, to prevent the tragedy the international cooperation is essential"
2305,I think this news shows that the government can't control and govern their country.However we cannot predict that what influence to the world the current condition of this country make.I hope a new war will not happen.
2306,"Mr.Yamamoto broke the taboo.It is worst,I think.And I had suspect about him.But some people forgot Fukushima's things.So we should remember about them.I think so."
2307,"Yes, he encouraged many discriminated people. I think we should respect his mind."
2308,"I agree last sentence a lot.However,I don't think the bill influence the freedom.The secret information government says is far from our life.Anyway,we should check government."
2309,I disagree you. Washoku is very delicious. You should eat Washoku.
2310,"I felt the same feeling,too you.And I decided to review it.I agree with you!"
2311,"I think so.we should protect Washoku,so it maybe good to refrain from fast food etc.They are sometimes harmful to our heath."
2312,I agree with you.And I think we have the right which know about our country's things.
2313,"I understand that this new law is necessary in terms of national security and counter-terrorism, and that Japan's law system isn't strong enough to protect the nation. However ,I don't agree with the secret law. I think that law has the danger of becoming the fear of limits on our freedoms."
2314,I disagree with you. I think Mr. Jang Song-thaek was not killed by the real nephew. But I have no reason.
2315,Kim Jong Un killed his uncle Jang Song-Thaek. That's so terrible. He killed his relative so easily. I cannot believe this. So sad. This news made me rethink of NK.
2316,"Kim Jong-un was scared that many politicians of the North Korea highly trusted Chang Song-taek.Now he was executed,it is said that the dictatorship of Kim will get much bigger.The nation around the North Korea should try to monitor and put pressure on the country."
2317,"I was surprised at this news because he is great people all over the world,but in Japan,I feel,there're a few news.We should not forget him and apartheid."
2318,"I feel the same feeling,too you.In the future,the same things may happen.So we should have countermeasure."
2319,"I agree with your opinion.Eating European food is being our common.However we are Japanese.When I heard this news ,I thought that we should know more about Japanese culture.I hope the time other Japanese culture gets these state come true."
2320,The news shocked me! And I don't know North Korean government will want to do. I think North Korea is a secret and hidden country. So I want to know the country more. The country is on my mind. I will want to check their actions from now on.
2321,"I agree with you.And I love Washoku.I think we should keep our tradition.At the first,I will continue to eat Japanese foods!"
2322,"I'm glad that washoku was added to the United Nation's cultural heritage list. It is expected that many washoku restaurants will be build,so Japan should make good program for foreign people who got interested in washoku."
2323,"Now,relationship between China,Korea and Japan is worse.That's because three country claim the domain.Japan has some problem Takeshima,Senkaku... I think the problem of domains is very difficult,so cautious remark is needed."
2324,"Now, I know this news for the first time.I'm worried about North Korea.There're some dangerous remark."
2325,I disagree with you. North Korea is not democracy. So this country is not in use our common sense. It is very sad thing but it is the fact.
2326,"I agree with your opinion.Considering the present international relation of Japan,we need to strengthen the relationship with America or to encourage the United States and other allies to share national security information with Japan.But I cannot agree the way the government decide."
2327,There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest people in the world and history.He told us so many things.We should greatly respect his patience to overcome the sorrows of many persecution.
2328,"Mr.Yamamoto's action is not proper as a member of assembly.In Japan,emperor should not have a contact with lawmaker,because it is decided by constitution."
2329,"I completely agree with you.We are university students and we have to study hard,so our bedtime tend to get earlier and later.We should take care of our sleep."
2330,I completely agree with you. It is impossible to make America stop using drone.It's sad but true.So America should decrease the use of it gradually.
2331,"I agree with you ID1330. As the proverb said 'The law is harsh, but it is the law',we Japanese must keep the Japanese law.So we should be more cautious in passing laws."
2332,"After I read this news, I think there is possibility that Kim John Un do something alike this incident.I don't know the real intention why Kim Jong Un killed his nephew, but I think he wanted to attract other countries' attention. I hope he won't do some terrible things for this purpose."
2333,"I disagree with you on the positive point of using drone that you think. I expect that some or many people may be killed when drone brakes. Because drone goes everywhere without a pilot, it could destroy buildings or strikes people unintentionally. They could bring great suffering of innocent people, so I think every drones should disappear."
2334,"I don't think that only important information for people is released by approving the state. What is 'important' anyway? The government will give us information what it wants us to see, not what we want to see. I disagree with the state secrecy bill because the government tends to hide them."
2335,"This is very sad news. I wonder why such tragedy accidents occur continuously? In fact, we can't feel it is real because it occurs another place where we can't see. We just try to avoid happening same accident again."
2336,"We all have 'rights to know' equally. If the bill is enforced in the future, it threatens to 'the right to know'. Is the bill against for Japanese constitution? Abe government said it is necessary to protect our country from terrorism. I think it is not true. I can't understand the relation between restricting 'the right to know' and protecting our country. I afraid Abe government will abuse it to proceed his policy."
2337,"Look back history of war, the new technology or weapon is certainly abused for the war potential. It is true that UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) is very useful if each country makes use of it properly. I'm worried each country abuse it for the war and the situation gets worse."
2338,I agree with you. It may be wrong the solution of stopping the war is military power. It is difficult to solve such a problem.
2339,"I agree with you. The action just violates human rights, so American government should apologize about it. It is surely to oppose terrorism, the information is essential. However, it does mot admit ignoring human rights."
2340,"I often try to steady my sleeping time. But, over few days, I am tired of it and give up. Recently, I cannot sleep well, so the fatigue remains next day. I would like to know the good idea."
2341,I think so too. 'washoku' is much different from other food culture. I want to eat whenever I visit foreign country. This is a chance 'washoku' spreads other country.
2342,"I agree with you. The bill is certainly abused in the future. Even if Abe government utilizes it properly, following government may abuse it. I think it is illegal and Abe government should withdraw it immediately."
2343,"Drone strikes may decrease the risks of its soldiers, but the problem is at the same time they make it easier to attack other countries, cities, and people. Because of drones, I think, the structure of human fight is changing. People have had guns and they attack people to protect their lives and families and countries. But drone strikes are committed by few, powerful people. Force of national army is getting absolute power, and I think the way we live and fight will be strongly influenced by it."
2344,"I can't understand why he can kill his uncle by himself. Probably, his intention is maintaining his power. If so, the action is insane or lunatic. In fact, the action is must be a failure. The North Korea lost confidence in China. Anyway, we must pay attention to The North Korea."
2345,I agree with your idea. I respect him and I'm so sad to hear this news. He must be one of most greatest person in the world. We should take over his will.
2346,"This is a really interesting finding. Someday, scientists may invent medicines or something to save our sleeping. Then we could live other ways and the way we work and study would also change. But I want the scientists to leave us the huge happiness to sleep in soft and warm beds."
2347,"Indeed state secret law would restrict our freedom of speech. It is very difficult to save the freedom of people without compromising the order. I agree with the law because we should give the part of our freedom to the government in order to keep the order, and this is the role and structure of modern governments."
2348,"It is very nice for Japanese cuisine to be listed on the United Nation's cultural heritage, but I can't think of this news without Japan's strong recommending of its cultures to the list. To be listed would lead to protect culture, but we should not strongly recommend our cultures because it's a shame. I think we Japanese should be more humble."
2349,It was dangerous. I worried about US and Germany start to not like each other more. I think the U.S can protect own nation except for spying.
2350,"I don't think so. Taro Yamamoto says good thing. Of course all action of his isn't good, but he does almost good actions. I think only TEPCO is bad."
2351,"I have been afraid of these problems since I heard of the news which told about the leak of NSA. Of course international laws have to be obeyed, but you can never stop leaking information or violating the laws perfectly. To keep the world order you have not to point all the violation out."
2352,"We Japanese can never ignore the problems about nuclear plants. This is really challenging and risky, but no one but us can, and must solve the problem. Leaving them as they are is no longer a solution. I will support the idea to run the risk to make a change."
2353,"He was a great person, and we lost a very important piece of human history. He had something that many of us don't have. He had a strong will to make a change, and never gave up even in the most severe situation. Most of us were born with many rights and take them for granted. To remember these great people's feats may get us to think about our lives again, and then we can live more beautiful lives."
2354,"I agree with you. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world."
2355,"I think it is a horrible news. I heard that hundreds of people who have connection with Mr. Jang was also going to be executed. It is of course unbelievable to hear this kind of news now in 21 century, but actually most of us cannot see the things without the perspective of Western. So if we say something against the systems of North Korea, we don't and shouldn't have any influence on them."
2356,I agree with you. What you insist on is necessary to protect the people's right and keep the order in the country at the same time. To make the secret clear is an indispensable compromising of the government.
2357,"Giving economic support the poor is nothing other than the rich's self-satisfaction. Only under the situation the European countries are suffered by immigrants, they should support them not to let them in. So partly I agree with you."
2358,"When I read this news I was afraid about relationship between Japan and China. This is because China achieved huge growing in these days and very important country for Japan. If relationship between China get worse, Japan will get a lot of damage. So I believe relationship between China and Japan gonna be good and build better relationship!"
2359,"I don't think his all achievements are great. He resorted to violence to get a Black Rights.He was not always great person. But he changed his thought and he solved the problem. Finally, he became a first president as black. So I want to praise not only his achievements but also his mind of brave to change his thought for peace."
2360,"I don't agree with you. Washoku's definition is very narrow. Washoku which got UNESCO heritage status is what is called Kyo Kaiseki, not natto. In japan, pure Washoku is very expensive and rare for Japanese. I think reason this time Washoku got UNESCO heritage status is Washoku has been lost."
2361,"I don't agree with you. Because your opinion is not correct. Why do you know in there are spies and terrorism's threat has been growing in japan. I guess you believe media's report with no doubt. If this bill will be passed, media's reports which you believe are implicitly and publicly controlled by power more and more and we cannot believe information on the paper and TV more and more."
2362,"I at first know this news by the internet.I can't believe this news.Everyone may be a traitor in the North Korea.In Japan, this news was seldom reported by TV.I think people should know this news more."
2363,"I think this news is the tip of an iceberg.In Japan,there're news about work.In order to cut labor costs,boss makes hard condition for workers.I think government should soon cope with this problem."
2364,"I have a image of freedom about the U.S.,but there're a lot of problem like this.Nowadays I look the U.S. on something suspiciously.The U.S. is a big country, so it has a big power.The world should look the action of TheU.S. carefully."
2365,"Drone strike is effective way strategically, and it can also reduce the number of soldiers who are killed in action. Therefore, citizens support the way better than previous way. Of course, we shouldn't break out any war, but it is extremely hard to achieve. So I think making the rule about drone strikes is needed and it will be made soon."
2366,"Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are hard to cure, so I hope the scientists can find the way to cure them. However, on the other hand, it is important for the scientists that the Government or something support their study economically. I think we shouldn't make such situation that a creative studies are hard to receive the support."
2367,"I was very glad to see this news. First of all,I think ,The Japanese food is one of the most delicious genre of food in the world. Of course it is also very healthy. I hear that The Japanese food have much to do with the life expectancy in Japan."
2368,"I was very shocked by this news and I also very interested in this kind of information.Considered by the fact that he often meet the Japanese governor instead of Kim,Mr.Jang was sure to be vital character for attacking the some problems of Japan-North Korea relationship."
2369,"This is the very difficult problem. For sure Nuclear plants is too much dangerous. We can't say disaster like this time's case never happen.But IN this 21th century, nuclear power is vital."
2370,"I agree with you. It is because international cooperation is required to solve such a problem. However, Japan cares about aggravation of a relation with a foreign country, and has not done good correspondence to the foreign country. Japan had better let an opinion pass more."
2371,"I agree with you. Because, probably, the manager does not regard them as people. The manager regards them as it being a tool. I am impressed by the World Cup of soccer being held. In practice, if I think that there were a labor problem etc., I am sad."
2372,"I don't agree with you. It is because I cannot eat Japanese-style food. Fermented soybeans have admiration and an intense smell stickily. I am poor at it. Japanese-style food has many the things and the raw things which were fermented. I regard Japanese-style food as what is called unique dishes having gathered. As for me, such Japanese-style food is seldom to its liking."
2373,"I like western dishes,but I like Japanese cuisine than western dishes. So this news is good for me. WASHOKU has many good point.For example ,it is delicious, healthy and we can feel season from it. So I hope that many foreigner know Japanese cuisine."
2374,"I think this bill is not good for Japanese people. Because government don't say TRUE information. When 3.11, government's information changed many times. So I can't think that this bill is good for Japan."
2375,"I agree with you. I am also opposed to a secret law. I think that the secret law is contrary to the freedom which democracy has. Surely the information which becomes a crisis also has a state. However, I cannot trust the present government. A Diet member will use a secret law and will leave an illegal contribution etc. unsettled. A state and the government have to get trust first. Therefore, the government needs huge efforts."
2376,I surprised when I read this news. I know that sleeping is important for human. But sleeping is more important than I thought. And I think that I need more time to sleep.
2377,"I think We should not use unmanned aerial vehicles. If pilot controls plane, it don't attack civilian by mistake. But drone may attack civilian by mistake. It is very dangerous. So I think we should not use drone to keep civilian's safe."
2378,"When I heard this news, I was little shocked because Kim John Un killed his uncle . I don't know the real intention of him, but I guess he did this because he wanted to attract other countries' attention. There are possibility that North Korea do something dangerous to attract other countries attention, so we should continue to monitor situation carefully."
2379,"I was really shocked when I heard he died. I know him well because I learned about him in the history class and in the English class and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man."
2380,"I agree with you. And I think that now is the time for Japanese to know our important culture, Washoku more!!"
2381,"What Mr.Yamamoto did is inappropriate as a member of assembly. I think he broke the taboo because he wanted to change the situation, but I think he should know better than to do such action."
2382,I think US should know better than to do such spying action.The reason why I feel so is that it is not good for the US to lose trust from the foreign country by spying other countries' leaders.So I think the US should stop their spying .
2383,"I was shocked to hear this news. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. He has a strong sense of justice and he has achieved a lot of great things. We don't have to forget what he did in Africa and the world forever."
2384,I agree with you. It is necessary to protect the important information from the other countries. But it also would protect government's secret from us. So I think the lawmakers have to define the meaning of 'secret' accurately.
2385,"I agree with you. It is difficult to solve. Through a debating, We have to find better way to solve this problem."
2386,"I agree with you. To solve problem like this, European countries should support African who endure poor life."
2387,I agree with your opinion. Counter-terrorism is important for the U.S. indeed. But I also think it is not the best way to spy. So they have to search better way.
2388,"I was very shocked to hear this news. Kim John Un killed his uncle. It cannot be happened in democratic nation. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world."
2389,"I don't agree with you because I think you don't have to tell your grandmother about the news. If your grandmother used to run washoku shop, she must have known the news. So your inform will be really offensive."
2390,"I agree with you. He was great because he never gave up resisting the apartheid, and changed the world. Despite his some mistakes, I totally respect him."
2391,"when I hear this news,I feel sad. We should do something if we can prevent such terrible accident. In my opinion, governments of Eritrea and Somalia should try to reduce the number of people who migrate from these countries.So many people try to migrate is the bad condition of their own country. So I think they should try to improve their own country."
2392,"I was really surprised to hear that.Trade unionists and human rights campaigners have forced the world to recognize the plight of Nepalese labourers in Qatar, who have to work 'like slaves'.The truth that some peoples are being worked like slaves is a bad situation,. This country have to change this situation."
2393,"I don't agree with your opinion. It is true that we should protect the important information from spies, but means to protect shouldn't be this low.I suggest so because I think this low can be danger of freedom of speech. I think saving freedom of speech is really important for us, so I'm against this low."
2394,"I don't agree with you. These kinds of researches may be useful and innovative, but they are also breaking the habits of human. Many of human morals are based on their lives and habits. So to preserve the moral, we should be too scientific and systematic."
2395,"I'm against with your opinion that drone strikes are necessary for us. I believe we can defence country without using drones ,and we should find better way to prevent country from attacks without using drones."
2396,"According to Yomiuri Shinbun, the 'Secret' isn't about the problems that is very closer to us, for example, about the nuclear plants but about things that are hard to understand for us, for example, GPS data or pictures taken by satellites. Whether this bill truly aims at the defense of Japan or not, such bill is actually needed. In fact, China has a unit for cyber attack called 61398 troop. We should not be against this bill until the government uses it wrongly."
2397,"I learned his achievement in the class of world history last year, so I know how great he is. it is unforgettable that all of his actions that is not simply aimed at the liberation of Black people but aimed at the equality of all people. As a result, South Africa has grown rapidly recently. I mourn for his death and I never forget his achievements."
2398,"U.S.is fighting against terrorism. It is reliable. But,to violate the international law and to claim that spies are justified are far from justice. US must claim the necessity of the spy and enjoy the approval from other nations."
2399,"This fact is nothing but catastrophe. Employers no longer see workers as the machine,not the human."
2400,"It means Washoku is popular and known for people all around the world. I love it and I want the washoku chefs to keep its quality. Therefore, those who are involved in washoku should be careful not to degrade its value and trust."
2401,"No matter how hard the US struggle to fight against terrorists, it cannot be the reason invading other country's 'privacy', in short, getting confidential information. On the different point of view, after all, bugging one's telephone must not be revealed. This accident is all blame to the US government."
2402,"I agree with you. Now that we know the lack of sleep leads to the disease,we have to review our life style immediately."
2403,"I agree with you. Even though for beating terrorism it is necessary to use the spy,the spy violate those who lives common life. It is serious problem."
2404,I felt very sad when I heard this news. I hope that accident like this will not happened anymore
2405,I felt importance of sleeping too. I don't know this effect. So I think that I need more sleeping.
2406,I think so too. Government should be more clearly about this bill.This is important thing.
2407,I have same opinion. I can't government's information too. And I afraid this bill will press our freedom .
2408,I agree with your opinion. Washoku has a lot of good point. And this is big chance for Washoku. I like Washoku. So I am glad to know this news too.
2409,I didn't sleep well like you. So I think I have to change my sleeping pattern. I don't want to have disease in the future.
2410,I sleep longer than you. But I think this is not enough. So I think I should sleep more.
2411,"I was very shocked about this news. This is because I also afraid about future of North Korea's government. If Kim John Un think he want to change or improve the country, he need to change and answer the attention from foreign country. North Korea is neighbor country for Japan so that Japanese government should attract North Korea carefully."
2412,I agree with you. sleeping is more important than I thought. So I decided to review it.
2413,"When I was high school student, English's text book said about him. So I know him before I heard this news.And I know that he is very important for Africa. So I was very sad."
2414,"Washoku is not only delicious, it is also good to health. So, I really think it is very good that the food culture of Japan has spread in the world. However, there is a tendency for Japanese people do not like to eat traditional Japanese in recent years. Now,we should rethink about Washoku."
2415,"I think this bill is the need in Japan today. If secret information, such as military is leaked out, national defense and trust of allies can not be obtained. However, I have a little anxiety because the range of the secret is not clear..."
2416,"I agree with you. I think that there is some responsibility to Europe in the refugee problem in Africa, but it is not the only cause. In addition, I think that before bring a charge, saving lives to cooperate in each country is important."
2417,"I agree with you. I think that there is some responsibility to Europe in the refugee problem in Africa, but it is not the only cause. In addition, I think that before bring a charge, saving lives to cooperate in each country is important."
2418,"I agree with you. He did not revenge, and moved in order to improve the world. We should respect this noble spirit of his."
2419,"I can understand America is doing all the means for the fight against terrorism. However, I think that the spying is counterproductive. This is because spying of other countries, the country is no longer trust the United States. And these antipathy also inhibit international cooperation."
2420,I agree with you! I think Washoku helps Japan to revival from the tragic earthquake!
2421,"I think your power of expression is so amazing!!! I totally respect him very much,,,,he was great person for us! Mandela R.I.P."
2422,"I totally agree with you. I thought the law is too dangerous for nation to be passed,,,but it was passed. so, we have to keep thinking!"
2423,"I agree with your opinion! I didn't know this function,so I want to sleep more."
2424,"I agree with you. I also think this incident is so frightening. For the future, we should talk and improve how to use drone!"
2425,"I was thinking same thing. Nowadays, our enemy is not country, but terrorists.... When I heard this news,,I thought about privacy policy."
2426,"I think Qatar shouldn't have detained the two Germans because Qatar has a lot of oil and money. It is clear that the labor may start the riot under such a bad condition, but it is also clear that giving the labor a good condition makes us feel good. I'm wondering why Qatar did such action."
2427,"Taro Yamamoto's action might make him hero, but all conditions, like time, place, occasion made him a villain. First, the contents written to the letter is not worth to handing to the Emperor. In short, FEARS about nuclear is weak. Shozo Tanaka handed the letter to the then Emperor about how the people 'actually' suffering the pollution. I think Taro Yamamoto is nothing but the fool man."
2428,"I was interested this article because it is the problems between the world's two 'strongest' country, the US and China. The US has the biggest economic and military power, but its power gradually declined. On the other hand, China' power is rapidly growing, but the high-handed way of ruling may have the possibility breaking the existing structure, as the long Chinese history shows. I carefully watch the two countries' tactics."
2429,"I think the government of North Korea is more fragile than China. The first leader of the North Korea won the people's popularity and was charismatic. The second leader succeeded the deification of himself and the nuclear experiment. However, the third leader, yet obtained big achievement like his father and the grandfather. Unlike the former leaders, he cannot rule the country by himself. I think the destruction of the Kim regime is near."
2430,"I agree with you. No matter how serious the cause of the accident are, the life of the people is invaluable. I feel the same as you."
2431,"I don't think so, the US have not shown the power by the military technology. Recently, the US have not won any war completely. Iraq, Afghanistan. More worse, the US couldn't use the military power to Syria. Actually the US has the strong power, but doesn't use the power effectively."
2432,"Your understanding is wrong. The government's decision making process is all shown through the Diet. The other decision making that is decided in the prime minister's official residence is highly political, so we shouldn't get involved."
2433,"i agree with you. By being added the cultural heritage list, Japan's image to the other country is better, and the government indirectly gain the political power."
2434,"I thought that this is tragic accident. Generally,passengers riding the immigrant boat are economically weak peoples. They forced to ride the boat for themselves and their families. But by this accident, not only victims but also their families will be suffered. Such accident should not occur again."
2435,"I think this is very controversial problem. At a glance, unmanned aerial vehicles are so innovative. This machine has chance to lead to technical progress. But it is bad to use this new technology for the way goes against justice. We must deal with technology carefully."
2436,"I was so interested in this news. Since I was young,I wanted to know why we have to sleep everyday. It is said that our sleeping time occupies 30% of our lifetime. I felt this is useless. But now,I could get information of important role of sleeping. So after that, I will take good care of it."
2437,"I think this decision completely harms Japan's democracy. We have the right to speak freely. This is ensured in the Japanese constitution. I don't think the regulation of freedom of speech will start soon,but it is very bad to leave the possibility of it."
2438,"At first, I was surprised to hear this news. I had a image that foreigners don't like Washoku generally. I sometimes watch movies that they eat Wasabi or Natto and tastes bad. I am relieved to hear that they exactly understand Washoku is not always with Wasabi or Natto."
2439,I think so. We must proud of our culture and understand it better.
2440,I agree with you. His great characteristic finally abolishes Apartheid.
2441,"I think so,too. It is not easy thing to rescue people from firing boat. It is very brave action."
2442,"First,I couldn't understand what happened in North Korea. Because the execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly. From old days,their politics has been unclear. Everyone wishes that this country soon becomes peaceful."
2443,"Me too. Because the information is very few,we could not understand about that country correctly."
2444,"I thought so,too. Since I got this information,my sleeping was not good. But I could understand the importance of sleep,so I will mend it."
2445,They lost sight of justice. Such childish heroism is no use.
2446,"Before reading this news,I have already noticed sleep is very important for our health but I didn't know about this amazing function of brain!! So, to make my life happier and more healthy, I want to sleep more."
2447,"When I read this article ,I thought that Drone strikes and lacking of transparency are not really good. but,this is too difficult to decide the justice..."
2457,"I think this law will be effective to win the confidence of other countries if monitoring organization functions. Top secrets like this article says should be kept in order to prevent people from exposing themselves to danger. However,this law can use conceal corruption and leaker can be punished un reasonably for self-interest of politicians. Thus,Japanese government must set third party up in order to make precise criterion of this law's application and to Spanish leasers reasonably."
2465,"It is true that state secret law is important if we think of national defense,smooth cooperation with other countries. But,although there were a lot of disputes about the law,its content is still ambiguous,and it might be used arbitrarily at the expense of people's right for freedom. I think that clear explanation and definition of it should be made for the sake of people. Or we will not be able to control our nation."
2468,"I have watched a movie whose main character is Mandela! He was great in that he never gave up getting along with people who had persecuted him. Finally he became the President of the Republic of South Africa. Now he isn't in this world, his efforts should be praised by all people and handed down from generation to generation.."
2477,"l stay up late every night. But after hearing mechanism of brain, I realized importance of sleep. It's surprising our brains work hard while we don't.notice. I felt l should go to bed early."
2483,"The establishment of state secret law is a negative outcome of one-party dictatorship. Japanese citizen often say that speedy making decisions is important for all. Nevertheless,we should have discussed this law more and more carefully before the law is adopted. In my opinion, this low is needed. this low makes politicians and bureaucrats pay more attention to management of secret information. However this law doesn't say clearly what is secret. I think we are supreme ruler and that we can decide whether it is secret or even abolish this low. we are now important point of Japanese politics.Thinking about politics and voting in the election are very troublesome things,but we should be aware of our own country's supreme ruler."
2488,"I think that this law is needed in order to give an alliance a feeling of trust. However, I fear to infringe on this law like a lot of antagonists because I cannot know what is secret.We have electronic devices to transmit information to people all around the world as soon as we get it. Therefore,there is a likelihood that we will be arrested. I think the government should make an organization that decide what is secret.It should be made up of politicians and bureaucrats who respect the will of people.The government should alleviate our anxiety."
2489,"It's great that Washoku,our precious culture, is recognized by people all over the world. Moreover we have to hand down this tradition to next generation.However, in this topic,there is a problem.When we talk about Japanese food, we often focus on only famous foods such as Sushi,Tempura. There are many kinds of traditional foods in Japan.So, I think it's good chance not only for foreigners, but also us Japanese to understand a part of Japanese deeply."
2491,"I was happy when I heard this news. I love washoku as a Japanese!Washoku is healthy and tasty. In addition, washoku is good for the Earth because it use seasonal ingredients. I am proud that washoku was recognized by UNESCO!I hope that many many people eat washoku and Japan will take back global confidence in food industry."
2493,"I think the statement that this law has danger isn't wrong.But this law is necessary. These days,information is very important. Leak of the secret information make our country be in danger. In addition,Japan will lose the reliance of other country.So a nation must have the law to prohibit bureaucracy from leaking secret information. Off course, we must supervise the government for some people not abuse it.We should not only criticize but also support the government."
2499,"I object to a thought of government (particularly Prime Minister Shinzo Abe) rather than enactment of secret law. In the first place, I think the politician is a existence to help the nation and improve their lives. However, we learned from this time, they are thinking about themselves with precedence and the secret law was approved without explaining it to the nation enough. So, I think it is necessary to consider what the politician should be."
2501,"I was so happy to hear this news. It's because, Washoku will become a famous food all over the world. Washoku is more healthy than other country of foods. So it have the advantage of diet-friendly foods. And also, Japanese cuisine is excellent creation. Japanese chef take in seasonal food, color, flavor and so on. We can appreciate Japanese cuisine. I expect it to spread through UNESCO heritage status."
2507,"I guessed it's important for us to sleep from way back. But in fact, I don't know the mechanism of brain. So I was very surprised at brain's cleaning mechanism. And I recognized it important again."
2508,"I found that sleep is important for not only fixing of memories but also washing away the waste toxins.People learn new things,memorize it,and forget it.I'll think a great deal of sleep from now on."
2510,"I love Washoku and I am proud of Japanese cooks.Washoku has a beautiful appearance,a good taste,and a wonderful imagination.After the Second World War,Western dishes have been popular in Japan.For example,many Japanese eat toast at breakfast.Judging from this circumstance,recognizing the magnificence of Washoku is a great opportunity to recall the importance of Japanese culture.Each person in the world should take pride in their own traditional culture."
2511,"After reading this news,I feel sleep is very important for us again.Because it can remove some waste toxins from brain and have a big role in the fixing of memories and learning.However the time we need to sleep is so different that I have to sleep more than seven hours but some people do not require much of time. In either case, we cannot live without sleep. So I think it is essential to sleep deeply and regularly everyday."
2512,"I am glad to hear that UNESCO select Japan as only the second nation after France to have national cuisine. Washoku is simple but intricate and Washoku has a delicate sensitivity. I love that,but I like western food too, so I want western countries to learn washoku and protect their own food culture."
2514,"I agree with this opinion. today, young Japanese usually use their sell phones or PCs to send a massage, but do not write a letter or a post card, so they cannot remember Kanjis, and they do not write Kanjis using their hands. I also use Kanjis on my sell phone using my brain not so much, so I cannot memorize new kanjis. Today's young children should write letters or post cards more, and should not use their sell phones so much."
2515,I was so happy when I heard the news. I was proud of the Japanese culture that was observed in the world. And I want people who come to Japan to know the taste of the real thing.I want you to come to Japan to people all over the world.
2518,"As long as the value of our lives is equal, the amount of news about someone's death which is broadcast shouldn't be unequal depending on the nationality. I can understand that explosions at the Boston marathon have a big meaning not only for the U.S but also for us. However, it is very important for those who live in developed countries , including us, to be interested in events in developing countries because we tend to think those events are indifferent to us. Therefore , media have to consciously focus on news in developing countries for us to be interested in those news."
2521,"Thanks to the article, I realized that food was not only for our health but also played important roles for our culture, economy, and so on. Especially, I sympathized Mr.Aoyagi's saying, 'Washoku is also regarded as important as it creates a feeling of social cohesion.' I think the honorable status, intangible cultural asset, will develop our identity as Japanese."
2525,"I'm really proud of' washoku.' It's elegance,thoughtfulness of creators,ingredients of the season,and delicate dishes,even if we take anything,I think,there are no traditional dishes like' washoku' in the world. Today there is the tide of the times of fast food,but 'washoku' would remind us what is important about our diet."
2529,"I think that it was good for Japanese government to enact a low about illegally downloads . However, as you know,the number of people who download musics and films illegally has not been decreasing .this is because the law Japanese government has enact is not detailed ,so people in japan are not afraid of it .Moreover,only a few people are arrested ! So Japanese government should enact a more detailed low as American government do so ."
2531,I agree with you. I think the fact that Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status effects a good change in the Japanese economy. And I think it is also a good chance to know Japan for people all over the world.
2533,"I'm really surprised to hear that news .As yuka shun said ,a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. This news made me think that all nations should ban people from using guns freely .However,if the company publishes the blueprints for the gun online ,people all around the world,for example Japan ,where people can't gain guns freely,will gain guns more freely.All nations should discuss how to use 3DS printer carefully."
2534,"When I was a high school student, I often found his name in the world history textbook. The textbook said he fought for human rights. If he didn't do anything , many black people were still treated unfairly. So I respect him."
2535,"I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem. There are two reasons. Firstly as Japanese forget kanji, kanji-Japanese traditional culture- is gradually declining in power. Good tradition must be preserved. Secondly the ability of Japanese will be worsen."
2536,"Captains have the obligation to help their passengers of their ferry and failing to meet their obligation is the thing which is not accepted. So the thing that the captain of South Korean ferry did is not accepted and he deprived the passengers of South Korean ferry of their lives. The captain and the company must apologize to the passengers and his family,and must explain how the accident happens exactly."
2537,"I like 'washoku' very much, so I am delighted for 'washoku' to become popular among foreigners. Now health-conscious people are increasing all over the world. I think that the demand for 'washoku' will increase more."
2538,"When I heard this news, I felt very sad because I esteem him. When I heard the story of his life for the first time, I was impressed. I think we should remember his effort and achievement."
2543,"Since I did not know about such work of a brain until now, this report made me surprised. Because my sleeping hours have decreased after becoming a college student , I have a new appreciation of the necessity for sleep, thanks to this report. Moreover, it turns out that this research leads to sick research, and I came to wish to know deeply about work of a brain. I would like to look for such news positively from now on."
2544,"This accident is very bad news. Above all, I feel heat that the captain left passengers in the ship and thought that he saved his own bacon. Certainly, many people would want to be saved at the very beginning if they are in his position. But he accountable to have fall into that circumstance which he had failed steering and the vessel sank, so he was supposed to help passengers preferentially even if he become the last person who board the ship. I'd like to have him become acutely conscious of the captain."
2545,This is one of the most terrible accident that I have ever heard. I hope more people will be rescued. We should never repeat such a tragedy.
2546,"I think this is an entirely man-made disaster and this disaster happened because of two reasons. First,the captain lacked a sense of responsibility. I watched the news which says a young conductor died because she had tried to help the ship's passengers instead of the captain who had run away from the wreck. Second,emergency measure wasn't prevailed among the ship's conductors. If the conductors had told the passengers not to stay inside but to run away,more lives was saved. Therefore,I think conductors of transportation need to improve their consciousness of responsibility,because they carry human's lives."
2547,"Yesterday, I watched the news about this accident and listen to the unbelievable comment which the captain said. He said that he hurt his hips and he was said 'Get out of the vessel! Hurry up!' ,so he just do as he was said. Moreover, he concealed that he is the captain when he was rescued. I can't believe it! After deserting his passengers, he acted as if he knew nothing about it. And people's dissatisfaction about the government is heightening more and more. I think that the government can't deal with this disaster properly, too. They neglect a training of talented people about duties of protection against disaster and safety. They have to strengthen it immediately. Now, the number of the dead reached 150 and 152 are still missing. I hope that a rescue operation is making fast progress."
2548,"I was surprised to hear this news. It may be unavoidable to have caused the accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. According to news, the captain said, 'This ship is safer than any ship.' Such a reason, It is natural that a captain is blamed. I think those who are doing work which protects people's life should become the most careful. I hope such an occurrence never happens."
2549,"When I first heard this news,I felt it was similar to 'Titanic.' As I knew the details about this disaster,it should be blamed that the captain's sense if responsibility was completely lacked and the Sewol itself was converted in strange way. Also there was no consciousness of safety I think."
2551,"Recently, I have heard about this sad news many times on TV, and every time I hear about it, it really made me sad. Among this news, there is something that is bothering me. Korean government refuse Japanese government's help. I know that between Japan and Korea, we are facing a difficult politics problem. However, I think we should help each other under such terrible condition, and that leads better relationship. I hope that many people who are still missing will be rescued, and such a tragedy will never happen again!"
2553,"Recently, I often watch the grieving families who are crying and shouting on the news. Action the captain took is absolutely unpardonable. It goes without saying. I think measures of South Korean government is bad. They refused support of Japan or America. I don't understand why they didn't accept it. There is no time because the most necessary thing now is to rescue the passengers. I fear search become more serious."
2554,"I think this is one of the most tragic disaster. Many of victims are not found now. It make me sad. I'm afraid that this deplorable disaster was forgotten by media and people. I pray that any disaster like this never happen again.So I want not to forgot. Moreover, media all over the world should tell people this accident entirely. This is a very very tragic disaster,but this is a man-made disaster which many people concerned indirectly.The best thing we should do is find the source of trouble."
2556,"I watched the news that the disaster like this happened in Japan before. Although in that case there were only 28 passengers in the ship, there were no victims. In Japan's case, the captain of the ship let passengers go on board a helicopter and get on a lifeboat on his own lastly. It is the very best and proper way to be a captain. Korea's captains should follow that Japanese captain and try never to cause a tragic disaster like this time's."
2557,"This article made me really sad and I think we have to learn something very important from this. First, we should consider the responsibility of captain. It is true that everyone wants to survive, however, I believe that humanity to others is the most important for us. Therefore, the captain's action in this case is not good. Second, we should consider about what 'safety' is like. I hear that in Korea, the standard of safety is lower than Japan. For example, it is normal that people don't wear seat belt in their cars. It is acceptable that there are some differences between the countries, but I think we need to learn from another country. In this case, if Korean standard of safety had been higher, this terrible accident might not have happened. Therefore, I think Korean government have to change and look over rules again soon."
2558,"At first, I was surprised and even felt angry at the captain's irresponsibility. But now,I think that, in a way, It cannot be helped. Even though he had the duty to rescue all passengers, it may require so much of courage as one cannot gather. Of course, the act that he did is unacceptable. However, it should be taken into consideration that, like many people, he is a man who is weak and afraid of death. Anyway, I can't do nothing but hope that such a disaster will never happen and the captain will be judged and sentenced legally."
2559,"South Korean government and the company managing the Sewol must have prevented this accident. If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill,this accident was not so serious as it is.This accident has caused widespread panic in South Korea and other countries.Moreover,the company has lost prestige.I think I won't ride ships possessed by this company. All I can do for victims is praying for them and thinking deeply about preventing recurrence of this accident. I feel irritated that I can do almost nothing for victims. Nevertheless, I hope there are survivors in the ship."
2561,"If my family or friends met with a accident like this news, I would get angry for a captain and grieve for them.And if I were the grieving families, I could not forgive the captain's action and existence.It is regrettable that the accident occurred.I think of victims and their family and friends,I'm very sorry about it.Althougt the captain's action was certainly criticized,I think taking place of his condition,he would also been terrified and want to live.I understand his feeling about that,but I would like to tell him,'you must understand that all passengers had the same feeling of you. They put their life in your hand,and how many people hope do your best for them and be saved.'All captains of vessels and pilots of airplanes think the news,and should image the worst case.And they must think If worst comes to worst,what they should do or can do.They must not forget a sense of responsibility about having passenger's lifes.I hope such a accident never happen again."
2562,"What will you do if a captain of your ferry escaped without telling the situation?Almost all of the people will do nothing under the situation. The captain of South Korean ferry took a mistake which made us sad.His lack of responsibility for saving his passengers aroused my anger.If it was true that he escaped earlier than anyone else,I could not believe this action.It is natural for a captain to saving the lives of people to the last.This accident had us to be anxiety of going by ship. I often use a ship and an airplane when I take a trip.If my family or friends were involved in such a accident,I would get angry for a captain of the ferry.This is two times that big accidents which makes us sad.I wish these accidents which killed many people never happen forever.It is because that a ship and an airplane is surely need to take a trip."
2563,"The captain's act is not acceptable. However I can understand his feelings. If I had been in his position, I would have left passengers like him. Putting passenger's lives before his own life is very courageous and difficult, but since he was a captain, he had a responsibility to do that. I learned I can't be a captain from this news."
2564,"Firstly ,I offer condolences on the victims of the accident. Many people who are as young as me are still missing.I wish they will be discovered. It is unbelievable to me that captain escaped from the ferry.Captains of ships are responsible for them.So they have to lead the passengers to escape.But he raced to get away without a thought for anyone else. I want to ride the ferry which is capsized by reliable person.I hope for captain's sense of responsibility."
2565,"I think this is one of most tragic disaster.A lot of people have not rescued yet. when I think about feelings of the bereaved, it feels me hurt and makes me sad.The problem is a captain responsibility and sloppy administration.I think we should be never happen like this accident anymore."
2566,"When I got the whole story of this accident,I felt sad and infuriated. This is not just an accident but a tragedy caused by slipshod management system of company operating the ferry.If a junior officer had not taken helm,this accident would not have happened.If the captain of the ferry had evacuated passengers, it would not have brought many deaths.However,Nothing comes out of just criticizing.They should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible."
2567,"This news made me sad, since many people including high school students ,who are coeval with me, died. Furthermore the most having made me sad is that this accident was a man-made disaster. The captain escaped more foremost than anyone else and alerted people on board no precautions against the ship careening. If crews had promoted more awareness and evacuated the passengers with feeling of responsibility, more people could have last out. Through this accident, we learned many lessons. As one of the lessons, many companies should give their employees training on safety as necessary harder than before. By enforcing safety standards, I hope that accidents by human mistake will have never occurred."
2568,"Reading this article, my first impression to the captain of the vessel was very bad. Of course ,it is true that every man is always afraid of his death but as the captain, he was responsible for all the passengeres.So,to him,it should have been the last thing to leave the vessel. From the bottom of my heart, I hope the captain and his crew will be sentenced strictly."
2569,"The captain of the South Korean ferry should not be allowed to practice as a detective.Captains have a duty to save passengers.However,this captain put priority on himself.I think everyone should take pride in and responsibility for theirs work. Also,there is another problem.The problem is the speed of investigation.When it comes to the saving of a life,the speed is the most important.Of course,South Korea is an advanced country,on the other hand,there is no end of troubles.From this point of view,South Korea is condemned.Then, I think Japan not only criticize South Korea but regard South Korea as a country from whose bad example one can learn."
2570,"This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And, all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes."
2571,"I think it is really hard to understand the consciousness of religion of other cultures. It is so sensitive and complex problem.So if we go to foreign country ,we have to be careful to religion,manners and customs of that country.And we must respect other cultures,of course."
2573,I can't understand why the captain and his crew jumped into a rescue boat and remained his passengers in the ferry. They should have given instruction to his passengers could move to a safer area. The captain have to take a serious view of passengers' life. Also Korean government neglected countermeasures. I think this disaster could keep off if there were proper countermeasures. I hope such disaster never happen in the future.
2574,"This news is really sad. 187 people were killed in the accident,and 115 people are still missing. I ached at the sad news. I felt angry about the captain's action. He was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized,and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. These are the action that a captain must not do. If he had acted responsibly as a captain,more people might have escaped death. We must not occur an accident like this again. I pray for the safety of missing people."
2575,"I felt sad when I read this news.A lot of people passed away and their family got angry so much about the captain who jumped into a rescue boat though there were many passengers in the ship.I also think he was irresponsible. In my opinion,the captain of the ship should not leave it until all the passengers are rescued.If he don't make the promise, we cannot be relieved when we take a ship."
2576,"Religion and culture are very important things. We often visit other countries or areas without thinking their religion,culture and believes.However this news showed it is essential to know their religions, cultures and believes. As our world have been globalized,we meet more and more people who have other religions,believes and cultures. I think we are needed to think more seriously about other persons religion,believes and cultures to respect their dignities."
2577,"This news made me shocked and sad,because so many high school students who were as young as me were killed by this accident.If only the captain had attempted to rescue them... When I attended a class of Korean language few days ago, I ask teacher who is from Korea opinion concerning this accident.She said 'This accident is not only excruciating but also too shameful as Korean to refer to anymore.Also, if you feel uncomfortable when you see pictures of screaming bereaved ,I want you to understand their pain. ' I think this accident involved the problem about responsibilities of leaders in every organization."
2578,"When I read the article, I felt great angry for the captain. That's because he gave up to rescue his passengers and deserted them in order to survive himself alone. Perhaps, hundreds were still in the water at that time, wanting to be rescued. If the captain has had normal character and advised the passengers to evacuate properly, many of innocent lives wouldn't die. In addition, according the article, almost victims are high school students. All of them had hopeful future, but now have grieving families. Therefore, it is no exaggeration that the captain's stupid act deprived students of their infinite potential. Sincerely, I hope such a terrible accident never happens."
2579,"When I heard this news, I was so sad. First, many people were killed in this accident. Especially it was the news that was very sad for me that a high school student was in an accident during a school excursion. It is a very disappointing thing that a young person dies. Second, the captain's action made us get angry. It was an action without a sense of responsibility. I think that I want the crew of the ship to compensate for a crime well. This news made us consider many point. I hope that such a thing never happens."
2580,"I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers.I think he wanted to be alive when the accident happened.If I face it, I would think so.However, he was the captain of the ferry which carried hundreds of people, so he had a responsibility to save their lives, but he neglected it.It is only natural that he is condemned.We should convey such a tragic accident to coming generation in order that we never forget it and it never happen."
2581,"I think this accident may be an example of Korean's problems. It's because this accident is caused by persons, for example, the captain of this ferry didn't operate the ferry. In fact, the most problem is Korean's society!! when the ferry was sinking, a student in the ferry called Republic of Korea Coast Guard(RKCG) to help people in the ferry. But, RKCG couldn't distinguish the call from a call from the captain. This example shows Korean's flaw most, that is, Korean government cannot respond to an issue in case of emergency."
2582,"I think that the captain should have dealt with this accident as a captain.He should have been responsible for passengers' lives .I regard a lot of criticism as quite natural.This accident took a heavy toll of human lives.If the crew had listened to the voices of conscience,this accident could have been avoided. We need to learn from and act on the lessons of this accident. We have to conduct an investigation in order to know this background.We need to uncover the reason why the crew neglected their duties."
2583,"This news made me sad. That many of the hundreds passengers were high school students is deplorable. In addition, I feel great sorrow in that many passengers still have been in the sea. I hope that people still missing will be found and bodies will return to their family. But, above all, I got angry with the captain who had jumped into a rescue boat leaving his passengers in the wreck. If he had given accurate information and instruction to them, more people would have been saved."
2584,I feel very sad when I heard the news because I personally respect him. South Africa was famous for its racism which was called apartheid. I think Nelson Mandela gave us some hints to live peacefully with another race and I hope his will will never be perished and we will take over it.
2585,"I can't help sympathizing with grieving families when I heard this news. I think the captain's crime was too cruel to be forgiven. Also,I found very interesting thing in this article.If this accident happened in Japan,we would criticise not only a captain, but also a company which employs him.It is because we think the company has a responsibility to train employees. I hope more victims would be saved from the ferry."
2586,"This news made me think a lot of things, the responsibility for work, the feelings of the bereaved, the importance of our life etc. In terms of the bereaved, of course I can understand the criticism for the captain. But I also think every life is equally important. The captain also had his family and maybe had the reason why he have to live. If the captain had been dead when the accident had occurred, perhaps he would be a hero now, but isn't it just our ideal? If you were the captain at the situation, can you choice the death while you have a lot of important things? I felt it is so difficult to think of the balance between the responsibility for work and life equality."
2587,"The problem of this article is responsibility of the captain, but I think that the company's education is more important. It is true that the South Korean ferry captain did an irreparable thing, however, it is also the responsibility of company. Company have to employ people with sense of strong responsibility and educate strictly. The problem of the Malaysian Airlines flight 370 occurred because of management of company wasn't strict. So I think company have to have strong responsibility."
2588,"I sympathized with victim's family, and also felt angry to Lee Joon-seok, his crew and people who loaded too much.I think that if Lee steered ship and cargoes were loaded too much,the Sewol didn't sink.So Korean government should check supervision system of ship."
2589,"I would like two to describe this incident. One is that I was reminded of the South Korean passenger ship sinking accident. A difference of two incidents is both a sad incident but only the point that the victim was illegal immigration. As for Japan where another of low birthrate and longevity have been a problem, an immigration problem often becomes the center of attention for an increase in population. In that case, Japan has to take in immigration positively rather. ... As for us the Japanese, this incident may not be every others."
2590,"I approve of homosexuality marriage. It is because one of my friends is bisexual. It is because she only calls it a woman and changes no objects taking to it to us. However, the sexual act between persons of the same sex causes a venereal disease of AIDS or others. Someday, Japan will also face this problem. We have to consider this problem deeply then."
2593,"First, When I herd this news, it caused me much pain. I think all of the captains must be responsible for rider's life, but the captain didn't carry out in the responsible manner. This accident may be significant to consider about responsibilities which professional seamen have. Not limited to this, other professionals like sailors and pilots (Malaysian Airlines flight 370 mystery too) have to be conscious of impotence of life."
2594,I was shocked about this news. I cannot understand why captain jumped into the sea without helping passengers still in the ship. Becoming a captain means he has a high position in the ship and also has all responsibilities of the ship and lives of all passengers who use the ship. I think there is more important things than earning money and fame.
2595,I feel sad to hear this news. I think a lot of people can't understand this accident in detail. So I hope Korean government expose information for this news as soon as possible.
2596,"I was shocked at this news, for most of the people who were killed in this accident were high school students. The captain of the ferry should have remained there and given directions to passengers. We must understand what is a problem of this accident and try hard not to make such mistakes again."
2597,"I think that it is very sad story. If I were a student who take the ship, I would regret choosing the ship, and if I were the bereaved family, I would regret seeing my son or daughter off. This is not just an affair of other people, and all the countries of the world should be care of their countries safety for a nation."
2598,This is one of the most tragic disaster that I have ever heard. It is a very unfortunate accident. There is a strong possibility of the case that I will be involved in such a miserable accident. So I think I must spend meaningful days in order not to have any regrets.
2599,"To hear that news,I was very surprised and sad. This is because the captain of that ferry who should have been left in the ferry jumped into a rescue boat early and abandoned many passengers and his crew .If he had remained, a lot of people would have been saved .Now,all I can do is hope that missing people will be saved.Moreover,the captain must explain this accident and do what is good for the bereaved families."
2600,"the captain had to have one choice in two choices, to save himself or to save his passengers, in this case. Of course, he has to save his passengers as the captain of this ferry. But if you are the captain then, what do you do? Do you blame him the same again? I guess he imagined the severe life after going back to Korea. But he thought to live as a criminal is better than to die. Not only us but also himself had the pretty sad. I hope to rescue the left passengers as soon as possible."
2601,"Nowadays, we see a lot of news like this. I'm afraid of the fact that the public transportation is not actually safe unless we believe so. In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him. The public transportation should take enough care about their safety and we always have to prepare for the accident so that we can react immediately."
2602,"At first, I got angry at what this captain did and feel sorry that many passengers are still missing;( However, I realize that I can't know what happened at the moment because I know the details about the accident only by mass media. I suppose we mustn't accept whatever we read in the newspapers and on the Internet without thinking by ourselves."
2603,"This article really surprised me because I never heard this kind of news before. It is true that religion is very important especially for people in Sri Lanka , however , I think this kind of arrest is not good idea. That is because I think Ms Coleman didn't mean hurting others religious feeling as she said, so I feel sorry for her. Also, at the same time, it is the most important for us to do actions which no one doesn't think insults to religions.There may be a lot of people who don't have enough knowledge of religions in the world, including me, so we should learn more about that. To realize this ,I think it is a good idea for us to get knowledge at school when we are students,for example. Then, we will need the government's help to improve such movement."
2604,"When I read this article, I understood that each country has each taboo especially referring to religion and we should not model things which is worshipped hastily like tattoo and act rashly for a cult object. It is a matter of course that devotees get angry with such action of foreigners. Also, as the proverb says, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do,' when we go abroad, we need to know about taboos of the region beforehand not to behave in against manners and customs of the country."
2605,"I realized again the importance of mutual understanding.Japanese people is indifferent about religion,because people who have particular religion is minority in japan,but religion is concerned with life to believers and often religion cause the battle.So I think if I trip or contact to intercultural people, we should be careful for our behavior . especially,we must be sensitive in shrine,church,temple and etc... in all over the world ."
2606,"I think this article alarmed that we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. There are many people in the world,so ways of thinking and faith vary,so like Naomi Coleman,people shouldn't have been arrested for her way of faith. However,we should respect other people's thought and faith and keep minimum manner. Thus,we should make manner's border clear in order to get along with other culture."
2607,"I don't believe a specific religion fervently and probably, most of Japanese people don't, too. Therefore I didn't understand why the police spokesman, taxi drivers, the plain-clothes police officer and so on were very angry against Naomi Coleman's tattoo and I think the treating she accepted is overdoing when I read this news for the first time. However my opinion was changed. She should have researched about religion, custom and culture of Sri Lanka before she went there and considered the feelings of them. There are many differences of thought and culture in all over the world. We own must respect and consider people who have different idea so that we overcome our differences and get along with one another."
2608,"Japanese do not have an obsession about any religion, but that is rare. Many countries in the world have problems related to religion. They believe in the absolute one that is different from a religion to another. This difference results in conflicts. In this case, it is not about the war but it is also connected to the religion, and the risk of being arrested is on us. We should understand it and when we are in a foreign country, we have to do everything carefully."
2609,"Religious matters are very difficult and sensitive. This news said that the woman who has tattoo about Buddha were deported from Sri Lanka. Of course, some may think that this punishment is hard for this woman because she may not have known about the religious rules. But this problem is more serious than we think. She is not allowed for the just reason why she did not know about this religion in detail . In Japan, most people have no strong sense of religion. For instance, Japanese ordinarily celebrate Christmas and visit a shrine or temple at the begging of the new year's day. It seems natural for Japanese but it is abnormal for the other countries. The most countries have strong feelings for the religion like Arab states. In Saudi Arabia, even if visitors are foreigners, they must wear Arabic scarf. If they did not adhere to the religious rules, they would be punished. Thus, we should treat religions with more extreme cautions."
2610,"We should embrace religious diversity. Prejudice of religion often cause conflict all over the world .I think that studying other country's culture is the first step in preventing religious conflict. Then, we should agree to differ each other. Certainly, religion is a sensitive issue to discuss. But, when I go overseas, check the taboo on ahead. Because I want to respect others as equals. I never blame Sri Lankan people by reason of having no common sense."
2611,"I believe that culture and religion are important in the society. However, extreme use of these will lead a governmental issue. For example, China has been picked up in the news in the past few days for breaking down the churches. Chinese government has been threaten by the expansion of Christianity, which they assume that it can place an obstacle on the road to communism. This tells us that even though people do not believe in religious, we are some how connected to it, thus, we have to keep it in our mind."
2612,"This news is difficult to understand because there are many cultures and religions in many countries.I think it is important that each country has culture and religion for oneself.However,if you make a trip abroad,you have to learn about the country's culture and religion.If you do not it,you will hurt people in the country.Therefore,learning about the country where you will travel is the most important to prevent religious conflict. I did not have undergo such a matter.When I made a trip abroad,I bought a book about the country before going to the country.Thanks to do it,I could have very nice trip. I understand her feeling,but being arrested is natural for people in Sri Lanka. In the future,I think it is important that each country keeps each culture and religion. However, it is also important to understand other country's culture and religion."
2613,"It goes without saying that we should respect each other and not say this and that about his or her personal culture. Likewise, one nation should affirm another nation's culture, particularly in religious issues. But I feel that, in the name of globalization, more and more people are not respectful to other countries' culture. Although money, commodities, and people flows across borders everywhere in the world, regional cultures is a sanctuary away from such things. So, it is quite natural for people in Sri Lanka that the woman was arrested for 'hurting religious feeling'. I want the world to be more tolerant about cultural diversity. Of course, It may be too strict for her to be arrested. However, this is also part of cultural diversity."
2614,"I think that the regional religion should be respected. Like this news, a certain action may be limited by a law. It is not a good thing to hurt the sense of other people by the action. However, because the personal sense of values that should be respected is included for the action, I think that it is too severe that an action listed in this news is a crime. It may be impossible that personal sense of values is completely respected.Therefore I think that it is important that each one has a heart in deference to another person."
2615,I think that culture and religion are very important in the society. I think that we should make manner's border clearly so we can get along with other culture. We should respect each other.
2616,"When I read this article for the first time, I forgot myself in anger. Of course it is TRUE that criminals should be punished by legal means, but they don't have to be in more agony than they have to atone for the crime they committed. I think the development of medical science should be used to ease humans' pains. We have to think more seriously about this problem because this problem is a matter of all people in the world. I suppose we should respect more for the rights of criminals and make better use of medical science to make all people happy."
2617,"As for the Japanese, much religion does not have the interest. Therefore it may be reported that it is often rolled up in a trouble abroad. The problem about the religion thinks that handling is difficult. And it is an unfamiliar problem for the Japanese. Therefore I think that the Japanese has to get knowledge about the religion when we go abroad. I think that it is the best measures to prevent a trouble."
2618,"Japanese don't feel importance of religion, but there are many conflict in the world. I don't know rule of various culture. So I will be confused in a foreign country. After reading this article, I thought I should learn cultures and religions of a lot of country. To live in the global society, we must respect and understand the life style each other. I hope the conflict will decrease by disagreement of culture and religion."
2619,"Some religious rules are so difficult for people who don't believe it.The national rules and laws are also difficult for foreign people.When I read it,it is so important programs for us that we should understand a nation's law, rule and religion in advance,as we traveling foreign country.As the proverb says 'when in Rome do as the Romans do',that's perfectly right . And the ideas is asked for us ,when we traveling another country. There are any struggle between religion.So people should intend to understand and respect for each other and each religions.That attitude and ideas are importance for enjoying our travels and lives.And I think that will be linked to world peace."
2620,"In Japan,religion does not have a deep meaning.I went to a Catholic school,but I am not a Christian and there was no problem.On the other hand,in many foreign countries,religion has given rise to wars.They are strong in faith and as for them religion holds absolute power. There is a big culture difference between Japan and countries with strong faith.Therefore,we should follow religious rules.I respect the proverb:when in Rome,do as the Romans do."
2621,"I was surprised,when I read this article. Ms Coleman was arrested only because she had a Buddha tattoo on her arm. This is absolutely impossible in Japan. Most of Japanese people are not interested in religion. They have little knowledge of religions. So,they may break a religious taboo like Ms Coleman. I think Japanese people must learn more about religion to build good relationships with other countries."
2622,"I know that there are some country that are sensitive to the religious issue. However these incidents are beyond my expectation. I have no religion, so I enjoy Christmas Day, and go to a shrine on New Year's Day. In Sri Lanka, the religion is very important, different than me. I think tourists should be be careful not to hurt their feelings."
2623,"I found very interesting things in this article First,there are some countries that a religion works as a law.In Japan,we aren't arrested if we do a sin.So it is difficult for us to understand this case. Second, there are always people who say 'We are not religious'. However, I think we are very religious.We can't insult our ancients and attack temples and shrines.Also we often say 'Itadakimasu and Gochisosama' when we eat food.We show gratitude for everything,and I think this show our religious."
2624,"In some countries,it is very important to believe in a religion.However most of us do not have a particular religion in Japan.For examples, we participate Christmas events, attend funerals, and pay their first visits of the year.I think it is because many religions came to Japan and mix with itself.Compared with other countries, we do not have religious issues such as this news, so I think it is not good to believe in it with extraordinary belief."
2625,"i think it wrong for police to tell her she is breaking the law only because she has other religion. it is natural that people should have different religion, so it is not good to enforce a law about religion. in the end, everyone has freedom of thought, so we should respect each idea."
2626,"I was surprised at this news when I read it for the first time. Basically, we Japanese don't have particular religion, and I think this is why I was so surprised at this news. However, each countries have their own religious background, and it is natural that people get unpleasant feelings when other people show disrespectful act toward tar religion. We should consider and respect other's religious background."
2627,"This is surprising news for us Japanese people. Because we almost do not have religion in Japan. People in other country usually have a religion and regard it as very important in their life. So we should understand other countries religions, their culture and must be careful not to hurt believer's feelings."
2628,"I have never cared about other countries' cultures before I read this article.I think this news is difficult to understand for Japanese because they have little interest in religion. Although the act is not a problem in someone's own country,that act sometimes would be treated as a taboo in other country because of differences of culture or religion.If we go abroad,we must learn about the country which we will visit by reading many guidebooks in order not to be arrested at a foreign country."
2629,"This case is very difficult to decide which side is right, because the woman certainly meant no harm, but we can't ignore the fact that her tattoo hurt Buddhists religious feelings. According to another article, some nations regard their religious precepts as formal laws. I think this article give a warning to us Japanese not to do unnecessary things in other countries, because almost Japanese have few interest about religions. In order not to cause trouble like the case, we should research the nation we would go in advance."
2630,"There is a proverb,every country has its fashion.This means every country has various religion,tradition and rule.When we come into contact with a different culture or connect to people from one, we should learn and respect the culture.I think Ms Coleman was culpable for not knowing that getting Buddha tattoos is disrespectful although she practised Buddhism."
2631,"This case is a thing which told us a gap of cultures.We usually live in home country.We should learn the gap in this chance.In addition,we learn culture not only in different countries but in our country.I think that we can't understand that gap.So we should plan system in which we can learn cultures in different countries."
2632,"I think it was natural that the visitor was blamed for this arrest.In my opinion,we should observe each custom in each country when we travel all over the world.Especially religious problems are so complicated and so deep rooted that we must care about it . However,in my another opinion,tattoo's design depends on personal freedom.So we shouldn't be pointed out about it. It is important that we have to be aware of our behaviors concerned with religious issue."
2633,"Since as Japanese,almost all of us don't have religious beliefs, I presume it is very hard to understand this incident.So,maybe I cannot express my thought well.But I'll try to describe.Of course,it is true that we sometimes have to respect our culture,but to foreigners we should take broad minded attitude,that is,we should also express our respect for other country's culture. What i want to say is we should shift to a multicultural society.Yes,it is so hard,but we humans are different from animals in that we can sympathize others and help each other.So maybe it'll take a long time,but we can certainly create multicultural society.Thanks for reading."
2634,"I think that religion has good aspect and bad one. Religion can control the thought of people who believe it. One thing, this may be the thing that this becomes like the custom of the country. For example, in this article, 'Sri Lanka is particularly sensitive about images of the Buddha'. On the other hand, believing the religion excessively isn't good, because people cannot think things flexibly. So, I think opportunities to think about religion seem to increase."
2635,"I think that religion has a tremendous impact on thought of people. That's why different people have different opinions about this incident. Some people may think it is natural for her to be arrested, but other people may think the police shouldn't place her under arrest. So,I suppose there are a lot of different opinions about this incident because we have differences of religion, nation, and ethnic groups."
2636,"I wasn't surprised so much when I read this article. Sri Lanka is famous in that it is a multi-religious country and most of people are Buddhist. They are know in that they follow the severe regulation that the believer must not eat meat. From this, we can know how much they value their religion, rule and Buddha. We are Japanese, we don't have certain religion. After all, the religious concept con not be understand by other races. Therefore we should follow the rule a little when we visit foreign country."
2637,"When I read this article, I thought that it is important for us to understand cultures people who live other countries have truly as possible.I am interested in going abroad, so I am planning to make an overseas trip while I am a student. This article makes aware to me that not only to go abroad but also understanding other cultural backgrounds correctly is unavoidable"
2638,I was surprised for this news. I didn't experience this case about discrimination. So we need to understand religion that it is different for ourselves. I notice this idea for this article.
2639,"I think we must try to understand all countries have different cultures. Those troubles were caused by cultures' differences. In Japan, such troubles sometimes happens. For example, those who have tattoo can't enter many spas,swimming pools and amusement parks. And we Japanese are often scared of them. But in some countries, tattoo is a kind of fashion. Like this, when we touch in cultures, there are many differences of view point. So we must try to understand them. And it needs some interest about other cultures we don't know."
2640,"The way the US execute criminals is as same as cruel torture. This execution is against the principle of the constitutional states. The principle says Criminals are punished because they disturb their societies' peace and order.Therefore punishments including death penalty are not carried out in order to inflict pains on prisoners. The us are needed to carry out the death sentences in safer and less grotesque way. In the way, I was surprised that condemned criminals are killed by drugs in the US.In japan condemned criminals are hanged.I think it is interesting in the way of death penalties."
2641,"People should follow the local rule or custom when they are tourists. Westerns say 'When in Rome do as Romans do' We also have a similar proverb. In the globalized world, people should respect .their culture each other. We should not do what you do not want others to do."
2642,"I think Sri Lanka's punishment for a British tourist was a little strict because she practised Buddhism and had attended meditation retreats and workshops in some Asian countries before. She didn't seem to insult Buddhism. However, also we should take care about religion and custom when we travel abroad. Some of our natural behaviours perhaps insult foreigners' belief."
2643,"I think that this problem is complex.We should respect for those who live in the country when we visit a foreign country.However,people in this news could not predict this situation.It is important for travelers to prepare taboos before they leave.In order to avoid this situation,the best way is to avoid the countries with severe religious problems."
2644,"I think every culture is respected and when we travel abroad, we should check that country's local culture in advance. This is because our sense of value is not always right, and we should accept various customs, cultures and ways of thinking. However, I think the woman's arrest is unreasonable this time. Of course the woman should check the culture of Sri Lanka in advance, but she was able to get permission to enter the country. If the country wanted to arrest the woman, they should have stopped her then. I think both a traveler and a country should make some efforts to know and inform their own culture properly."
2645,"Different countries have different cultures. So,accidents such as this sometimes happen . Before you visit foreign county,you had better understand the culture of the county. Particularly,when religion is involved, you have to be careful of religion.Otherwise, you might be damaged."
2646,"There is various religion in the world. Since Japan do not have a specific religion, and faith is free, i was able to believe my ears hardly in this incident of Sri Lanka. When we the foreigners get in touch with different culture, i keenly realize that i have to understand the culture well."
2647,"I was feeling keenly that killing by chemicals is a pretty cruel thing. I disagree with killing animals in pharmaceuticals. I have a dog, so it is unbearable that animals are sent to the health center by having discarded by owner and would be killed eventually, using such as gas or injection. Lethal injection, which exists as one of executions, I was well understood that the death-row prisoner writhed in agony pain and dead by reading this article. I think it is terrible that the process which a lethal injection had failed and the prisoner dead. However, I think that it's inevitable that the wrongdoer was suffering from lethal injections when we put ourselves in the victim's place."
2648,"Capital punishment is, in principle, done as a warning of other would-be criminals, and I think that the nation's attitude to treat criminals according to the weight of their crimes cannot be criticized. However, too much cruelness make the nation's reputation and confidence lost. I think that the current way the US carry out the execution is so humane that it should adopt new and more humane way of the penalty."
2649,"I hadn't known a gay marriage is prohibited in America, so I was really surprised when I read this article for the first time. I agree with Obama's opinions because the number of people who love same sexual people is more and more increasing recently. This problem is not familiar to us Japanese, but we have to think seriously about this because this is a matter of human right. It is very difficult to conclude this problem, but I wish gay people could express their love freely someday."
2650,"I cannot believe that the drug of using animals uses humans to execute capital punishment.This is because the injection may fail to work.The way of executing should use more humane and less prone to error.However, I think it is natural that a criminal feel the pain as the injured.Capital punishments need for criminal to atone for what he did.Using three drugs is more dangerous than using one drug.Therefor,if they use three drugs,they succeed in injecting absolutely.We should consider carefully about it."
2651,"When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished. It is true that criminals are should be punished. But a false charge may always happen and recovery does not attach it after a capital punishment.Therefore, I think that the capital punishment itself should be abolished, before considering the method of a death penalty."
2652,"When I read the article,first I think people who should be executed capital punishment take a pain is proper thing.But, every criminal is person, so they have human right.And when they are suffering from drugs ,some executioner also suffering from their groanig.Their stress is so terrible. Just considering the two side ,I think one drug to carry out lethal injections are better than three drugs caused acute pain.But,using some drugs and executing people are last method.So before we think what kind of drug we use,we should take it more seriously about the fact that we kill the person however he committed murder."
2653,"The story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is very horrible for me. No matter how terrible crime he committed, he has human right. I think the way of execution should be decided by criminals."
2654,"I think that the death penalty should be abolished. Why do we need death penalty? People who back death penalty are very illogical. First, killing people is very cruel especially execute someone by lethal injection. Second, life imprisonment has deterrent against crime in common with death penalty. In conclusion, there is no necessity to carry out death penalty."
2655,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised at Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett. I knew that very cruel thing such as this execution was carried out actually for the first time by reading this article and I felt a sadness and a fear. The three drug method just causes a person too much pain, hurts people's feeling and gives people emptiness. I think this is a too cruel torture and no one come to be happy by it."
2656,"This news made me sad. In the first place, there is still a discussion about morality of capital punishment. Because death penalty might violate human rights. In the way, Amnesty International is doing anti death penalty activity. In addition to this conflict, the matters about cruel torture may infringe on human rights more and more. Even if men who are punished are heinous criminal , they are human. So as long as the human rights are protected in constitution, they should be treated as honorable person. Thus if we agree with death penalty, we should activate the discussion about the way criminal are punished."
2657,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and shocked. At the same time, I felt this was a very serious problem. Although I don't have enough knowledge of drug, I thought we all have to try something we can do to solve the problem because this is very important matter for all of us. I think execution by the three drug method is too strict for people however bad the criminal is. Therefore, I feel we should reconsider this kind of penalty seriously. Furthermore, I thought that I have to learn about law harder and harder in the university and I want to have more knowledge about execution."
2658,"When I read this article, I was surprised very much. It is surely that the person who committed a crime receives a punishment. However, using three-drug method is too terrible. All over the world, capital punishment exists today. But, because a prisoner has human rights, not the death penalty, I think that the we should give different punishment. In any case, we learn about a law seriously and should think it."
2659,"When I read this article, I felt that I was fierce. The Clayton rocket of Oklahoma has human rights as one human being, too. Therefore, in this matter, I think that it was an opportunity to change a thought about the death penalty. Presence and the human rights of the death penalty are very difficult problems.However, the death penalty such as the torture cannot be necessary."
2660,"I didn't realize capital punishment was unbearable pain. Although Clayton rocket committed an inadmissible crime, the way he was killed is too cruel. We should think again about capital punishment. Because modern medicine and technology are developing, we can introduce better way of death. I don't think the death penalty should be abolished, but administration of justice need execute it after considering human rights."
2661,"When I read this article, I was very surprised with that the official had allowed to use the untested drug.Although I don't think we should abolish the capital punishment, we must recognize prisoners as human.They have some rights as we have.So,we take care of them humanly.Some people say 'They are in prison because they killed someone or used drugs.So,it is quite natural that their rights are ignored.'Although I can understand what they say and I have the same feeling somewhere in my mind, I think they are totally wrong.As long as we live, every of us should be recognized as a member of a society"
2662,"I was surprised to hear that, in the United States, it is allowed to execute death row inmates with drugs, in the first place. In Japan, drugs aren't used in execution. I wonder why the US take that way, and why they use drugs that banned from using to euthanize animals. To me, it sounds like humans are inferior to other animals. It is true that humans isn't superior to other animals in any way and that it is important to treasure them. However, humans are valuable, too. We should confirm that and reconsider the system of executing in the US."
2663,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. Clayton Lockett killed people and raped women. So, he must make up his crimes. However, he has human rights, and no one can deprive of his human rights. The accident is too cruel treatment for him. I think that the US should stop using drugs to execute death sentences, because cruel accident like this must never happen again."
2664,"I don't agree with execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals. Certainly, criminals have to suffer punishments and victims desire it. However, punishments with illegal drugs go against humanity. We should take a serious view of humanity and think how they can correct errors."
2665,"I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned. I am in favor of death penalty.Because some situation should do death penalty.But I think if they do death penalty, it must be quickly and it must not be painful. So, I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned."
2666,"After reading this article, I felt that the execution of Clayton Lockett was so cruel that I cannot agree with using the three drug method.He was very guilty ,however, this execution like torture had an ethical problem.So I suggest that we should not use that drug."
2667,"I think this article is issue of natural right which a condemned criminal has. I disagree with using lethal injection. Because, we must not treat life lightly, even so, it is a condemned criminal's life. I have two reasons. First, if the drug fails to work properly, he die with suffering. Drug lethal injections have a high risk. Second, this drug may be smuggled over. For the reasons, I disagree with using lethal injections."
2668,"When I was read this article,I was surprised that it is allowed to use drugs for execution in the U.S. despite the fact that this way can cause acute pain and lead to grotesque scenes.I think it is unnecessary for people who commit crimes to give pain.I know it is natural that the criminals commit crimes,they should be punished.However they have human rights,we have to make allowance for them.I think execution using drugs should be abolished because of such reasons."
2669,"I think people who committed sins need to be punished in any way.But it is nothing to say that they are 'people' as same as us so we have to consider their fundamental human rights. Especially capital punishment is a disputable point.In my opinion,I don't disagree with capital punishment.This institution could restrain brutal crime. However,we must more care about the way. We mustn't occur the worst case , terrible process which a lethal injection fails."
2670,"When I read this article, I can't believe this execution about using drugs. I had thought that using drugs are banned all over the world. However, I can't agree drugs uses lawfully in some situation. In order to solve this problem, I hope drugs would disappear in the world."
2671,"I thought it a good way that we use a drug to kill a criminal, but I changed my mind. I think it a bad way. it is because it is cruel for us to use a drug. Rather than killing people immediately, using a drug makes people feel pain before their dead. It is true that using a drug does away with making persons kill a criminal with their hands such as push a button to kill a criminal. But using a drug makes them see a situation that a criminal feels pain. It makes persons uncomfortable, and they go mad, if they see the situation too much. For the reason, I think that we should not use a drug to kill a criminal."
2672,"Recently,capital punishment is greatly debated.The point is usually its morality ,whether to do away with. At any rate,we should hold human life in high esteem.Even death-row inmates are human,so their rights should be respected.Therefore,I think that employment of capital punishment should be sedate and easeful for them."
2673,"I think using the drug administered to the death penalty is a bad thing because Mr. Dennis and Rocket died given the suffering and punishment beyond their crime, and pain. I think that this is not good ethically. There are two reasons. First, the most of effect of current drag is uncertain. Second supposing medicinal medication goes wrong, The family who are looking will be a lot of shocked.The right explanation is given before using. But given the science and technology of today, we should refrain from the use of the drag for death penalty."
2674,"There are a lot of comments that say 'It is morally bad to execute people by using drug cocktail I presume that this theme is very interesting. In my opinion,I think so too. It is true that an offender should be punished ,but that should not be capital punishment by using drugs. That measure would give them more pain than what they did.But I think capital punishment is needed. Because,I think that capital punishments deter crime.So we have to change the way to execute."
2675,"When I read this article, I had mixed feelings. I think euthanasia is not necessarily bad, cause we should have the right to chose our ends (I don't approve of the idea entirely, thought). But, If we make the choice by drugs, we have to examine many times before using them. We cannot examine it with people, so we will use animals. It is the same thing for death penalty by drugs. We have to avoid the problem like Clayton Lockett. However, we should think about the right of animals at the same time. It is the so difficult matter."
2676,"When I read this article, I was surprised and shocked. Of course, Clayton Lockett must be punished for the crime of killing people. However I think that he shouldn't be executed in a way that ignores human rights. He is a human too. Should he have died struggling? But If I were a relative of the victim, I wouldn't say the same things."
2677,"I was shocked to hear the news.A criminal is also a human being,so his life should have been treated more carefully.This is not my opinion,but from Christian point of view,it is said equality under god.Also,in this accident,lethal injection was untested.So to speak, he was a testing bench. Even though he was a condemned criminal,his life was only one time and I thought his last should have been calmness."
2678,"When I read the article, it made me surprise and I felt so sad. Before reading the article, I was for execution by using drug, because in terms of criminal's human rights, I thought this method seemed to be better than shooting or hanging. However, considering the terrible case, I changed my mind. Using drug is no less cruel than shooting or hanging. Apart from the problem whether or not we should abolish death penalty, we have to reconsider the method of execution."
2679,"Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs because I thought the criminals could die in piece and with no pain by this method. However, my feeling toward it had totally changed. It can be as cruel as other methods such as hanging. Most of us the Japanese are for with the idea of capital punishment, but maybe we should reconsider whether we should adopt it or not."
2680,"At first I think it is a humane way to execute inmates with drugs. But as I read this article,I noticed that there is a possibility of being cruel and precarious. Though Clayton Lockett is a criminal,his human right should be defended,I think."
2681,"I think using drug like lethal injections for execution is humanitarian,but this situation is not. Actually It is sure that Clayton Lockett committed serious crime.No matter haw he is brutal criminal, he is a human and has human rights.And it should be defended."
2682,"I think this news shows how indifferent to other's life we are . I agree with execute inmates with drugs if a condemned criminal can die without pain. However,in fact,we treat their life carelessly. We should improve our consciousness about other human's life."
2683,"Before reading this article ,I thought that using drug for execute criminals is good in terms of human right. However, after reading it ,I came to think that we should stop execute or find other ways to execute . Of course, criminals are bad and punished, but they also have human rights .we should respect them for protecting our human rights"
2684,It's surprising for me to be different between way of execute in US and EU.But I'm convinced that it's natural to be different.For many things are different around the world.But I think Clayton's matter is crucial.He killed a girl so it's natural for him to be stated death penalty.I think he wasn't have to dead suffering.So we should work out a way of execute.
2685,"I felt sorry for Clayton Lockett when I read this news.It is true that the crime that he committed is too cruel.However,nobody had the rights to give him unjust heavy pain in this country governed by law.I am for capital punishments,but I believe that we can respect for the criminals to some extent when he is executed."
2686,"The famous artist was arrested by drug possession yesterday. i often hear the news caught in drug possession I have the experience which actually refused the drug. It takes courage to refuse a drug. However, it is an important thing In order to keep its own body and the future..."
2687,"I have ever made vocabulary notes by using only Example 1. But I surprised to know that there were several kinds of example. I think Example 4 is the best way to remember words because a word is associated with other word, so I will be memorize them smoothly. Also, Example 2 is one of good ways that we rewrite it with other English words if there is a difficult word. We can improve our English expression skill considerably. I'm going to make cogitate vocabulary notes by referring to these examples."
2688,"I have been made my vocabulary notes like the first example and sometimes wrote stresses. But this way is lacking to learn a language. When I read this article, I was interested in the second example and the third example. If I use the second example, I will use appropriate words instead of difficult words. If I use the third example, I will learn a lot of synonyms. So, I want to use these examples when I learn a language."
2689,"I have memorized English vocabulary by only using the first example, but sometimes, I felt that this is not efficient enough. By reading this article, I found the useful way that I want to use next time. Among five examples, I'm interested in the second example. By using the second example, I can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences and these are good for seeing how words work in real situations. From now, I would like to try this example when I study English!"
2690,"I have not made a vocabulary notebook until now. However, through this class, a vocabulary notebook had various forms and knew that there were a good point, a bad point each. I wanted to make a vocabulary notebook after having understood it. I think that English results might improve a little more if I make a word notebook in high school days. I want to learn the word in future without idling about."
2691,"I think the third example is best. I had been making the vocabulary notebooks as the first example until I read this topic. However, I knew that there are various kinds of vocabulary notebooks and I came to like the third example by reading it. Because the third example is categorized cleanly, easy to read and we can memorize many words which are connected mutually the same time. I think the first example is so simple and good when you study English vocabulary for the first time. The second example is too difficult for me because I'm not good at English very well and it is written in only English. The forth and fifth examples have too many words in them and difficult to read a little."
2692,"I have made a vocabulary notes like the first example.It is easy to make and to memorize a vocabulary.However,I think the third example is the best way to memorize.This is because it is written parts of speech and meaning in Japanese.Therefore,I understand the vocabulary easily.Besudes,I think also the second example is a good vocabulary note.Understanding a English vocabulary in English is the most important to study English.however,it is difficult for people who is not good at English.I will try to use the note like the second example when I memorize vocabularies."
2693,"I use the first example of vocabulary notes all up until now. But, I think the third example is easy to remember. When I came up an unknown word, learn some related words at the same time. This is a rational approach! Then, I write some example sentence as well as words. I want to speak English fluently."
2694,"When I read this article, I reconsidered the way of making vocabulary notebooks. I have been studying English for a long time, however , I haven't thought about the role of vocabulary notebooks or what should I do to make them more better to learn English. Therefore, I found this article very important for me and I thought I have to try not to forget the importance of vocabulary notebooks. When I was a high school student, I didn't use the English-English dictionary frequently,but this article made me find the importance of understanding the English meaning. The reason is that I think the English meaning is much better to understand the English words meanings than Japanese meaning. Furthermore, we can tell another people the real English words meanings in English. From such reasons, I think I will utilize the English-English dictionary more often!"
2695,"I think the third example of vocabulary note is best. When I was a high school student,I used the way of making vocabulary note.because the way of writing made me read and understand the meaning and pronunciation and collocation. I have forgot the importance of device to make note more effective,so I will take note the by the way of writing."
2696,"I have made only the first example of vocabulary notebooks, but this article taught the way of studying word to me. I think the third example is beneficial . It is efficient we learn related word at the same time, and pronunciation is very important to speak English. After this class, I felt I am not enough the amount of studying English word. So I want to study vocabulary using these way."
2697,"I always use the first example of vocabulary notebooks. But, watching some examples of vocabulary notebooks, I felt that my consciousness changed. Because a vocabulary notebooks shown in the example than the vocabulary notebook which I used so far is relatively more useful. For instance, if I use the second vocabulary notebook, I can learn the meaning of various words at the same time. I make such a vocabulary notebook and want to raise one's command of English from now on."
2698,"I usually make vocabulary notebooks like the first example .The reason why I made it like the first example is it is so simple to see and easy to make it. Reading this article,I learned some ways of making vocabulary notebooks.And I learned the most important thing for me is whether I could master some words.I understand meanings of words ,however,I cannot use the word well.In other words,I should change my vocabulary notebook style into new style which can be learned collocations to speak and write smoothly.Although it takes many time to make new vocabulary notebook,I don't care about it, if I come to speak and write smoothly.So I would like to try to make vocabulary notebook using a word maps. I'm glad to learn about many ways of vocabulary notebooks and each of these style's merits and demerits."
2699,"I have ever made vocabulary notes like the first example.I realized that this way seemed to be easy to remember,but it was not effective.No matter how I memorize only Japanese meanings,I cannot understand how to use the words in English.That's why my English skills do not make progress.So I would like to practice to make notes like the second example,because this way shows me example sentences and synonyms.I think this way helps me to understand deeply and to improve reading skills. From now,I try this way,and make efforts to be good at English."
2700,"When I learn vocabularies by heart, I make a notebook which I wrote English words in the right side and in the left Japanese meanings. Always I was bothered to memorize these words. These words which I learned by rote in this way were difficult to come up with. So always I was wondering which is the best way to memorize English vocabularies. Through this article, I understood that in order to master the English vocabularies there are some requisite points like synonyms, pronunciations, word maps and so on. Especially I am thinking that the most important part is example sentences. It is because it makes no sense if we cannot come up with the word which we want to express. From this time, I am thinking that I change my way to memorize the English words."
2701,"I think the second example is the best way to brush up our English skills. Example sentences give us a chance to infer the meaning of words. We can improve reading skills by inferring the meanings , I think. I used a vocabulary notebook which included various example sentences when I was a high school student and I was be able not only to remember a lot of English words but also to read English sentences smoothly later."
2702,"I thin the third example is best because we can read the note easily. The note tells us meanings of words, different forms of them and also pronunciations. This type of notes are seen in vocabulary textbooks we may have used when we studied for entrance exams. Those textbooks are easy to use for studying. However, I have made a note that is like the first example. My note can tell readers little things. I want to make my note have more information."
2703,"I often make a vocabulary note like the first example.But if I study English using that vocabulary note,I can not know how to use some English words and listen to them.So I want to make vocabulary notes like the second example. However it is the most important thing to study vocabulary notes over and over because we can not memorize English words just one time."
2704,"I think the third example of vocabulary notebooks is the best vocabulary notebook. It is because the third example is easy to see, and there are many information about words, for example, Japanese meanings, pronunciation and word families. You can learn many things about one word, if you use a vocabulary notebook like the third example. My vocabulary notebook is like the first example. It is easy to see, but there are only English words and Japanese meanings. So, I will change my vocabulary notebook like the third example."
2705,"I think the third example is the best, because I think 'a part of speech' is very important elements when we read the foreign articles. We have to judge the word's part-of-speech in an instant if we would like to read them quickly and accurately. In addition, pronunciation is almost very important when speaking in foreign language. The third example includes these good points, so next time I make a vocabulary note, I will refer to it."
2706,"Vocabulary notebooks help us understand English words,so they should be easy to see and have a lot of information.To be specific,collocations,example sentences,and word families are important.Fourth example and final example include word maps.Word maps have a lot of information,but they look complicated.I think second example is a good vocabulary note book,because it is written in only English and we can grasp how to use words.I want to try to imitate second example."
2707,"I have never thought of the efficient vocabulary notebooks.When I study English words.I always use the first example because it is so easy that I save more time to remember the words instead of making vocabulary notebooks. However,from now,I want to adopt the second example.The second example is like an English-English dictionary.The good point of the vocabulary notebook is that we can improve the skill of explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill is useful especially when we have presentation.We are preparing English presentation now,so I want to make good use of the learning."
2708,"I have ever not contrived to make a vocabulary notebook.I have only written English words and Japanese meaning.This time,I could know many type of the way to remember English. I think number 3 is the best way.This is because the indispensable thing to study English -word family,pronunciation,part of speech- is written in it. I am not a native speaker or returnee children. So above all,I have to remember correct spelling and understand right meaning. But,if I can skill up English skill,example 4 and 5 will be a valuable pattern because studying connection of words make text easy and deep."
2709,"I think the vocabulary notebook is very important because writing new words helps us to remember them. However I have never care about its style. My vocabulary notebook is similar to the first example, but I think example sentences should be written too now."
2710,"Making vocabulary notebooks has been my habit since I was a junior high school student. First I have written English on the left.Second, Japanese meanings,the word's pronunciation,accent,synonyms,English meanings and collocations. But my usual way is not clear at example sentences-when and how I should use the word. So I want to write example sentences,word family to grasp the word."
2711,"I wrote the things which should memorize it such as words since study for examination thoroughly and remembered it. Specifically, firstly I learn it by Japanese translation. I write in the investigation, an example sentence at a notebook with an English-English dictionary, and the illegible thing learns it by the Japanese translation next. I will continue in future and want to make an English study."
2712,"I have made my vocabulary notebooks like the first example, however, after reading this article, I noticed that it is not enough to learn how to use the word naturally. It is important to use the words naturally to speak like native speaker of English, so I will try to make my vocabulary notebooks like the forth example to improve my English speaking ability."
2713,"I have made the note like the first example. But it isn't often useful when I study new sentences written in English. Because an electronic dictionary is better than it every time. I think the third example is the best notebook of all. But it isn't worth making vocabulary notebooks. There're two reasons. first, they take you many times. Second, it's pretty hard to find the word you want to know in them. On the other hand, an electronic dictionary is easy to use and find. So I think they should be made so as to get self confidences and motivations. if you make them for the reason, I'll agree with you."
2714,"I have made a vocabulary notes like example 1.It was most important for me to memorize as much words as possible when I was a high school student.However,what I am required to do as a university student is to convey my feelings to both native speakers and non-native speakers in English.Therefore,we should understand English by English,not Japanese.I think the second example is the best vocabulary notes."
2715,"Before reading this article ,I had used only example 1. However, I realized more effective ways of talking vocabulary notebooks . In my opinion,we should use various ways of doing it ,according to occasions. For example, if you want to improve your collocation skill, you had better use example4!"
2716,"I felt sad to read this news and remembered the Nazis. I think the execution of Clayton Lockett is impossible because it infringe his humanity. He killed people, indeed, but it doesn't mean losing his humanity. What I was most surprised at is that officials have allowed this execution. Criminal law of U.S is different from that of Japan, but I think humanity should be saved in all countries. So the death penalty must be abolished."
2717,"I think that the vocabulary notebook is important for studying English. The vocabulary notebooks help me memorize Japanese meanings of English words. But I haven't thought about the way of making vocabulary notebooks. Now, my vocabulary notebook has only English words and Japanese meanings. I intend to take many collocations, word families in my vocabulary notebook from now on."
2718,I think a memory tree is one of creative idea to memorize many words.I can memorize more words using colorful notebooks than a normal monotone notebook.I tried to make it rule to memorize words by a memory tree. But it didn't work very well.I want to make memory trees all the time I study.
2719,"Everyone thinks that the vocabulary notebook is necessary for studying foreign languages, but like the examples in the article, there are a lot of types of how to make vocabulary notebooks. If you adopt a wrong methods of making them, it would be not only inefficient, but also do harm than good, just like taking wrong medicine. As for me, the third examples is the best, because it is very easy to understand what the English words mean. On the other hand, the fourth and fifth example are bad. The style of word map is very messy for me, and the style is inefficient to learn words because it doesn't place the Japanese mean."
2720,"I have ever made a memory tree like an example 1 when I was in high school. But I think my memory tree was not detailed and difficult to find information. I think an example fourth is the best because there are a lot of information and every words are put in order, so it is the most useful memory tree.I will make effort to make good memory tree like an example forth."
2721,"To improve your English ability,I think second example is the best. I presume that the more you use foreign language,the faster you can learn. It is important for learners to actively use the language which they want to master. It is true that other ways to learn are also good,but ,in my opinion,the second example is the best!"
2722,"I like second and third example. These are easier for me to understand what to write. The other is good to get a lot of information. However, it is more difficult to read all information immediately. So I like second and third example."
2723,"I think that the second example is the most effective in understanding English words and increasing vocabulary. If you want to read English smoothly, you should not 'translate' it into Japanese. You should just practice 'reading English as it is'. The second example is very good in that it gives you plain definition and example sentences only in English. Without translation, you will be more familiar with English, which makes you better at using it."
2724,"I agree with you in that information is important and should be protected so as not to be leaked. But even so, the contents of this law is very vague, which enables the government to use quite a few kinds of information arbitrarily. To support the government, the situation is necessary where it is supervised in order not to abuse the law. But for now, I do not have any confidence in the government because of its attitude. If the government do not change, I will not stand by it."
2725,I agree your opinion. As I thought it is cruel thing that killing condemned criminals using three chemicals. But I also there is no help for it because the criminal constituted that much serious crime. We should consider how to execute in order not to be too terrible while we incorporate and opinion from a point of jurisprudence view.
2726,"I am agreement at your opinion. I also feel anger for the persons involved in this incident. However, when there were few cargoes, didn't the incident occur? It may also be a fact that surely there are many cargoes and operation of a ship has become inconvenient. But, I think that the first problem is a captain's action. So, I think that the incident had occurred even if there were few cargoes."
2727,"I agree with your opinion that we learn cultures not only in different but also in our country.I hadn't thought of learning our own country,so I am impressed by your idea.Usually, when I read some news like problems of gap of cultures,I tend to try to understand other country's religions,cultures,systems. Reading your comments, I realize it is important to understand our culture. If I understand other country's problems,cultures,and religions,it is no use to compare other country with our country without understanding our own country's knowledge.So, we would like to understand other country, we learn about our country first of all.That is so important,but I forget it.It is good for me to read your idea."
2728,"I agree with your opinion. We should think carefully about using some drugs, because it cause acute pain and deprive criminals' human rights easily."
2729,I don't agree with you. I can't take forever to decide a way to die. This decision is very cruel. The death penalty should be abolished completely. It is the best way to protect of human right.
2730,"I think so.Those who have a responsibility has to consider others.The captain didn't think about the passengers.They believe the crews,but they betray them.I forgive what they did."
2731,"This is a very difficult problem.It is unbelievable to me.However, everyone is free to believe in religious.So I cannot say someone is wrong. This help me travel abroad.One action is ok in japan,but same action is NG in other countries.We should know other countries' cultures."
2732,"I think culture and religion play an important role in every society, too. And I suppose we have to respect for difference of religion , and this action needs 'manner's border' Reina called. We should live together with people , who have different thinking , religion, and culture on the earth , so we have to get along with everyone."
2733,"When I read this story, I thought we didn't know what the war was exactly. At the same time, I found the importance of the real story from people who live in which the war happened. It is true that we all learned about the happenings in the war when we were high school students,however, I think it is the most important that we have more chances to take actions to understand the war. Also, we should not consider the fact not being related to us. This is very important incident for all of us in Japan. According to this article, Japanese education puts too much attention to Tokyo. Therefore, I want the government to reconsider the curriculum."
2734,"I think we should understand that there is a big culture difference between Japan and other countries, too. I also respect the proverb,and to do so, we have to take actions to have more knowledge about severe religious rules. Then, I believe more and more people enjoy traveling all over the world."
2735,"I think that the Example 3 is the best notebook. It's because there are pronunciation and word families. When we memorize vocabulary, Example 3 is good notebook because we can know related matter at the same time. So I think Example 3 is the best notebook."
2736,I think so too. The captain must be subject to punishment. And I think the impact of mass media is large. I pray they rest in peace.
2737,"I have a same feeling about this news. I also want a matter due to the luck of captain's responsibility does not happened again.I think the captain of his passengers should save their lives.Otherwise,we will not use public transportation from now.Therefore,I want people not to forget a matter like this."
2738,"I agree with ID1418's opinion. You should learn about the country where you will visit before you visit the country, if you want to enjoy your trip. Otherwise, you may make a trouble like this article."
2739,"I completely agree to your opinion. Actually, I thought that the news was similar to the Titanic, but the difference between them is 'season' the accident occurred. In Korean case, if the passengers had jumped into the sea, they would be alive. The captain should have more responsibility all the more because people who can be rescued died."
2740,"I agree with you. The most basic human rights are treated apart from careers, characters and so on. I think that they are absolute and must be secured for every humans all over the world."
2741,I agree with this opinion very much. It is important for us to embrace religious diversity. Sometimes we are liable to decide things on our own criteria. This is subjective. So in order to understand the others' cultures we must study about those and we need to get to know that there are many difference cultures in the world.
2742,"I think the second example is the best. Indeed,it is easy for us to understand the English words in Japanese. But vocabulary notebooks in English are more useful. Because we can remember more words and imagine the words. Therefore I think the second example is the best."
2743,"I think it's exactly as you say. The captain and crews of Sewol,Republic of Korea Coast Guard and the Korean Government was irresponsible and very loose. So the more they had sense of responsibility,the less people died of the Sewol tragedy,I think. And I think too that Korea should retrain the responsibility and consciousness of government employees and the crews."
2744,"Many people pay attention to the contents of the textbook.But it is necessary to obey the law.And the town should obey it.The teachers of Taketomi teach not only history but also moral as a subject.Do they really think their children will grow up honestly and get the skill as independent adults who have citizenship,even though they break the law because of their biased views of left-wings?Taketomi should keep the law as a role model of the children."
2745,"I think that I cannot necessarily blame only a captain. It is a very difficult thing to make a calm decision at the point of death. However, I cannot forgive a captain. It is the problem that is not easy to treat."
2746,I always watch TV that The president of South Korea pursuits the issue.But is it top priority for her?I don't think so.She should put stress the right of life of people.Why did she send the limited number of a rescue party?She thinks lightly of lives.Japanese navy and Air Force can have gone to save many people.Because Japanese Forces is in Sasebo near Korea.And she should have asked Japan to do so.Maybe her pride prevents from asking.
2747,"I don't agree with you. I think it is necessary for a criminal like him to execute.This is because if there is no capital punishment, a criminal will increase.And you said his life was only one time,but it's unfair that he isn't executed instead of having murdered. However he shouldn't be killed like a torture since he has human rights and it's against ethic.This idea is the same as you."
2748,"I strongly agree with you. I think Japanese foods have sometimes mysterious tastes for foreigners, but this is very traditional and complicated, so we should be proud of them. Especially, their appearance are so beautiful. Our national characteristic largely reflects them, so knowing Japanese foods as UNESCO heritage can inform of Japan and Japanese people widely."
2749,"I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed."
2750,I agree with your opinion. We should use science for human's benefit even if the receiver is criminal.
2751,"I think so.A captain of ferry has a task which is saving passengers' lives.If an accident happens,he must do this and prioritize saving passengers.He who jumped into a rescue boat without saving is far from being a captain. I find that I am not cut out to be a captain,too."
2752,"I agree with you. But, it is also dangerous to try diving in the ocean before a ship capsizing.There are as many dangerous things in the ocean as in a sinking ship. So, all we can do to prevent such cruel accident from occurring again is to improve all drivers security awareness and ethics."
2753,I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish death penalty. Life can't return after death. miss judgement may occur.
2754,I think so to. Washoku is a value based on a society's culture for Japanese. I wish many foreigner
2755,I think so too. Washoku is a value based on a society's culture for Japanese. I wish many people around the world have it and know how delicious it is.
2756,"It is a very difficult problem. we should learn the second world war from various perspectives. But it is impossible to unify many perspectives about the war into Japanese formal history. A national history is an important element of the nation. So Japanese government is reluctant to teach wartime mistakes. In this case, I suggest that teachers in Taketomi teach the town's history not only civil textbooks but also hearing survivors story and visiting historical sites about the war."
2757,"To ID1410 I have also used the first example and from now,I also want to adopt the second example!!!The second example is like an English-English dictionary.We can memorize words practically because it uses example sentences as you say.We are going to have English presentation today,so I will try explaining the meanings of English words in English!The skill we have acquired by using the second example is now displayed!"
2758,I do not agree with you.I don't think that the countries governed by law should allow criminals to decide the way of execution. The way of execution should not change by feelings of criminals.
2759,I agree with you!
2760,"I agree with you.Of course,criminals should be punished in some way. but that shouldn't be capital punishment.Capital punishment has a lot of fault. For example,If we execute someone by accident,we cant resuscitate him or her.So we have to abolish the practice of capital punishment."
2761,I agree with your opinion. I think human right is equal. Execution is not right for dignity
2762,"We should offer all the students uniform education.It is true that it is important not to forget the tragedy. However,students who receive compulsory education cannot doubt what their teachers say and what textbooks say.Therefore,we should not have accepted illegal states.If you think that one law is not proper,you should change the law.Ignoring law is not right."
2763,"I don't know what is correct about this problem. However, I think that teachers who know the truthful history should tell students it. It is because if they don't tell the fear of World War Ⅱ, students and also we can't understand the fear of war. We, particularly teenagers, are not so interested in war problem. So, I think that it is necessary to educate youth not to repeat the same mistake."
2764,I agree with her opinion because I think she understands the danger of drug.
2765,"I think the idea that the Japanese government decides the content of the textbooks is wrong. If it were possible for the government to decide it, the government could easily manipulate citizens will, and this is the same way which was introduced in the wartime. We the Japanese should never forget the experience of the wartime."
2766,I totally agree with you.
2767,"I agree with ID1442's opinion. As he said, we Japanese must be careful to many differences between Japan and a country we'll visit. Besides, we shouldn't be prejudiced against people who have different religions, looks and habits without a right reason."
2768,"I agree with nanami's opinion. As she said, I think the punishment for the British tourist is a little strict too. She never insulted Buddha."
2769,"I'm able to understand Mrs.Nakamura's opinion. I'm always afraid of prejudice because sometimes we cannot find it, and I think education is one of the most contributory ways to make it. Like North Korea, if I was taught 'Our country is best and justice.' from early childhood, and every adults around me said it, I would definitely believe it. A big authority can provoke people. We have to know about the fact and it is necessary to always doubt whether our thinking or education is right or not."
2770,I felt the same thing.The worst was captain who didn't evacuate passengers.But only blaming him is good for nothing anymore.I guess they should review their safe control.
2771,I thought that the textbook problem is difficult. Many Japanese people especially the young like me will not know the war in detail because we had never experienced it before. So publishing companies should write truth of the history and society concretely and make textbooks and we choose textbooks that we can think it useful and justice to study the best. I think it isn't good for nations to become pushy like dictating textbooks.
2772,"It is true that Mr.Abe's aim is to make Japan 'strong' again. In fact, he argue that Japan should grow out of the post-war regime. But I think this poses the misunderstandings. He do not want the nationalism of the Empire of Japan to be back. In the flow of globalization, which make every nation connected with one another in terms of economy, social system, thoughts,and cultures, Japan is now losing its influence in the world, particularly in the East Asia. I think that a little conservative educations have potentials to change that situation. Although there is a lot of dispute about the contents of textbook (and I do not support extreme nationalism, such as affirming the war), 'patriotic spirit' is now necessary to make the nation more-tied, as well as taking account of Okinawans-who suffered from the painful war."
2773,"First, I was very very surprised at this news. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. I think EU should export drugs for capital punishment to the U.S because the death penalty is legal in the U.S and drugs from EU are necessary for smooth execution. By doing so , the U.S don't need to use the three drug method but can use the one-drug method and as a result, smooth execution will be realized, I think."
2774,"This news clearly show that Sri Lanka whose 70% of the population is Buddhist is very pious Buddhism country. Since tattoo is one style of the fashion, it is not strange some pious believers feel bad that their God is treated carelessly. And It is also true the point of view toward religion is various in many countries, so we need to keep the phrase 'When in Rome do as the Romans do' in our mind when we travel abroad."
2775,"When I was an elementary school student, I had an opportunity to talk with a person who explained Word War Two. She said 'I was taught that Americans are very evil in our school. However, it was not true. After the war, I found out that they are ordinary humans and very kind. I remember that an American soldier gave me a chocolate. I think Americans are far more kind and gentle than Japanese'. I think that textbooks influence student greatly. we must defense pacifism and it is important in education."
2776,"I agree with this comment.There are many different points around the world.For example,food,clothes,greeting,courtesy,and so on.This is a matter of course,but there is one thing to be common to all,importance of human life.No matter how different their culture is,human life should be treated carefully."
2777,"This British woman is from different culture background. Someone who come from a different cultural community is thought a strange and foolish man. They do not understand a different culture. I am a christian,so I know exactly how she felt ambivalence. Japanese did not accept Christianity at first. Most of us do not feel it familiar even now except Christmas. But what is different between Japan and Sri Lanka is that Japanese don't oppress people who don't believe in Shinto and Buddhist. Sri Lanka should learn kindness and tolerance."
2778,"The medical law is not organized very well. The situation is very similar in Japan. American should obey the law. Also, they should confirm the existence and importance of the medical law. But the problem is there is not unified code. I think the code is necessary in this modern society. In this code, they should establish the rights of those who is performed medical treatments and even those who is imposed death penalties by drugs. By this code ,although it is innovative and lawyers and jurists don't claim the code is legitimated,people can change the relationship between those who perform and those who is performed fundamentally."
2779,"We don't know what is true about the war, so contents of textbook have a major influence on learning children.There is various perspective in history. To see whole of history is difficult and sometimes textbooks are written conveniently. So we should have always critical thinking, which will help us understand how is the war. Not only we change perspective, but administration should reconsider how they teach children history and what is education."
2780,"When I read this article, what I thought at first was that education was powerful and could have danger when it mistake to step. I was frightened with Japanese education during World War Two. In other words, education is a kind of brainwashing. It has power which change our mind and our ways of living. Nakamura and her classmates were brainwashed by adults are militarism. This row about textbook is very difficult. I don't know which is right because I haven't experienced war and I am not from Okinawa. But what I want to say is only one. I hope that all young people receive right education so that Japan would not follow the same horrible way."
2781,"We can learn from this article that history education is very important for us and it effects its power on us.So its necessary to understand the right story. However, recently, there are some different interpretation on the same story and it sometimes cause international problems. For example, Japan and Korea have different interpretation on a part of WW2 each other. As the idea of globalism spreads to all over the world now, we must consider which story is the right."
2782,"I think we should take care about textbooks, especially when they include history. Because, we are influenced by textbooks easily and they are important tools when we learn about history. Textbooks should inform it neutral. Also, we should learn about war from people who really experienced it. They can teach us true stories, but they are aging (about 70~80 years old) and opportunities we can meet them are declined. So, we should convey true stories from them to next generations in order not to repeat disastrous war."
2783,"When I read this article,I wanted to learn about the true of World War Ⅱ.We are convinced what Japan did in the war by education in Japan.I know that American in the war have an apologetic that killed many Japanese.They are very kind people.I think the education has led us to prejudice against Japanese history.Therefore,what is written in textbook does not give the correct information in talking about Japanese history of ever to us.A young people like us have to learn the true of Japanese history.Japanese have to accept any history to discuss fairly with China and Korea.I want a chance to take the correct education to learn about the true of the history in Japan."
2784,I use the second example of vocabulary notes until now. This time I know many kinds of vocabulary notes. So I'll reconsider the way of making vocabulary notes.
2785,"I oppose to use textbook compiled by the state. It forces majority value on children. Don't impose majority values on minority. Everyone should respect human dignity. Otherwise, we repeat the history of tragedy of war. I think that local school board makes free decisions about textbooks. We should imagine Okinawans people."
2786,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs. Now, however, I think the death penalty must be abolished."
2787,Those troubles were caused by cultures' differences. I think that we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. It is so sensitive and complex problem. We should reconsider our behavior in other country.
2788,"I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion.The war should not be happened ever.Sometime I think Abe check China a lot and poke Japanese patriotism and he want to change the Japan constitution.If the constitution will be changed, Japan might be militarism.Textbooks are same.I think textbook should not be changed.If it will be changed, students might be brainwashed."
2789,"I think it important for us to be taught the world situation exactly. According to the sentence, in the past, children were not taught world affairs.I think that it would cause a lot of problems. For example, if someone didn't know the fact that there are some colors people in the world, the person would discriminate them. It is so important for us to understand world affairs. So it is wrong for us to teach the world situation in error. But We still have problems that we sometimes teach the world situation wrongly. At first we should understand the situation and teach the situation in details."
2790,"I think that all of schools in japan should use text book including the same contents. But a board of education in Taketomi should obey the law so that people in Japan are not fell in confusion.If teachers would like tell the students another story using other text,they do so.But they also teach common contents using a common text. They need to explain the difference carefully for their students.And history is so difficult and complex problems.So we need to learn and consider a problem from different angles to deepen ours knowledge about it.Not only schools in Okinawa but in japan learn about many opinions about history problems .And student think how do you feel,if you can't make your answer is no problem.The important is the process and the fact that students are thinking about it ."
2791,"When I read this article, I was very surprised.I think capital punishment is necessary.But using three drugs is not humane.They are criminals,truely.However, they are humans too.So we should think better of it."
2792,"I do not know most about this problem. However, I know that I must never fight. We have a duty to hand down misery of the war. However, you must not twist history education of Japan on account of the country. It is a difficult problem, but there is the thing which you must protect."
2793,"About 70 years have passed since WWⅡ was over. 1945, when Japan seemed likely to lose, have witnessed a lot of tragic events. Battle in Okinawa, the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Potsdam Declaration. I think every event has to be taught at school and every Japanese have to remember them. However, I heard that some young people don't know when the atomic bombs was dropped and when WWⅡ was over, and to make matters worse, some of them don't know there are tragic war against USA and British(United Nations) during the 1941~45. In order to break down such present situation, I want the government to put emphasis on historical education."
2794,"I think a civics textbook should tell us what happened in World War Two exactly.World War Two broke out about 70 years ago, so those who experienced it are declining. That's why we have to listen to old men's war story carefully, especially Okinawa.This is because we must not break out a war and make Okinawa a front-line sacrifice again. Therefore I don't agree with Abe's determination to nullify the pacifist constitution."
2795,"Textbooks have a a big influence when children learn some things.However,sometimes,there are wrong descriptions in textbooks,so those lead students to understand wrong facts.The contents about WWⅡ are very severe.There are different opinions between Okinawa's education boards and Japanese government.I think the former should choose textbooks,because there are many people who experienced WWⅡ in Okinawa and people who live in Okinawa think about the war much stronger than Japanese government. This textbook problem is difficult .It must spend time to solve it."
2796,"Once,Japan was very strong country in Asia in terms of economy,force,and so on.But with the globalization that connects all over the world,and the rise of various Asia country like, China and Korea, Japan has lost her position. So,to take back former dignity,Mr.Abe may act hastily. I'm not good at politics,but what I can say is history is extremely difficult,and there are a lot of viewpoints .So There's not any right viewpoint. But what I can say with confidence is everybody think the same thing ,that is, 'Peace is an important thing for everyone' So,I would like the top of the countries,in other words,prime ministers and presidents to establish policies to create peaceful world."
2797,"69 years have passed since the Second World War came to an end,so few people know the tragic accident.We should listen closely to those people.War is one of the most terrible incidents and the only people who experienced it know how the war is.Of course I did not think only Japan was wrong,but I cannot judge whether my opinion is right or not.Today,recognition of history is regarded as important,Japanese prime minister,Abe,should think about war carefully."
2798,"Death penalties should be banned quickly. In Japan capital punishments have been executed for a long time. As the opinion of the minority, They think because constitution in Japan says 'The infliction of torture by any public officer and cruel punishments are absolutely forbidden', putting somebody to death should be stopped. In this article, person which passed death sentence was treated badly. I think it can't be the doing of a man in his senses."
2799,"I have not regard making vocabulary notebooks as important doing, so I hardly did that. So I didn't know appropriate vocabulary notebooks. people around me have nice notebooks, and I found that it makes my memorizing English words easy, and this article introduce many examples, so I want to make my original vocabulary notebook."
2800,I doubt we can do as you say. Because people do oppress when they truly cannot understand and accept a different custom basing on a religious background. So I think people cannot do everything carefully. I think we should conflict as long as it does not become violence or incidents. Until we do not collide with others we cannot help each others and understand them.
2801,"Two years ago, I went to Okinawa for the school trip. I went to the cave where a lot of citizens sought refuge at World War 2. I felt cruelty of the war and I can' t forget what I felt at that time ever. The reason why I disagree with Abe' s policy is not a logic, but the feeling at that time. I don't want my family and friends to die in the war. I think the tragic affair like World War 2 mustn't do over and we have to find how to realize the peaceful world without war."
2802,"I disagree with you. Because an alternative penalty of capital punishment must be a life sentence. But people don't bear living in a prison whole life. And most of death penalties result in prisoners being overwhelmed and become crazy. So we certainly respect the rights of life of people,by abolishing death penalty,also we violate the personal rights. Therefore, I think we mustn't abolish death penalty. And we introduce a life sentence. And prisoners can choose which sentence should be executed. It is related to not only the criminal law the medical law,such as the problem of euthanasia."
2803,I think Shinzo Abe may be a nationalist and a little dangerous. He seems to want to revive warped patriotism in wartime. It can cause military conscription again. We should never go to war with any other countries. We should do everything possible prevent terrible tragedy from happening again. I felt protecting democratic and peaceful education is the most important thing all over again by reading this article.
2804,"I think a textbook specifies children's thinking. Therefore, we should become earnest for choosing a textbook. First of all, it is not so good for a children that country and rural areas decide a textbook. Biased and simple of people's thinking may cause a running wildly of the nation. I think in order to stop that bat situation educator has to teach that a textbook is only one of the opinions."
2805,"Your example of Chine and Christianity are very good. Confrontation of religion and the policy of a country causes various problems. I also think that society and religion are inseparable things. Especially Japan, many people's conscious of religion is low.So we should recognize our own connection with religion."
2806,"I almost agree with you. Capital punishment should be abolished.Present science technology and court system are insufficient for performing a death penalty. But,we must not forget that death punishment becomes a deterrent of a big crime at the present time."
2807,This is a difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.
2808,"I agree with Your comment. -- 'If there had been strict rules about security, and if the company had done a fire drill,this accident was not so It approves of the opinion serious as it is.' I think that the crew lacked the simulation and knowledge of the troubleshooting.The captain said later, 'It was considered When the accident, I could not think anything excepting how to I will be able to live.' It is because the captain was not able to assume such a miserable accident. Probably, his head has filled then. Nobody should not forget that there is a danger of the accident.For that purpose, a detailed text book and training of fire drill are required."
2809,The influence of textbook is equal to brainwashing. The powerful person of Japan should take reader's damage of heart caused by war.
2810,"I have made many vocabulary notes ever. But after read this blog, I have never made vocabulary notes that can be useful for except exams. From now on, I will try to make vocabulary notes like example second that is useful for not only exam but also real conversation."
2811,It is interesting your idea that 'religion works as a law'.
2813,"During the war, the education was used in order to justify nation's policy. In fact, there were wrong things in the textbook of the day. this article said 'She and her fellow townspeople want no more of Tokyo-centric education that glorifies the nation and recognizes war as a just national expedient.', and I agree to this.I think Thus resistance against Officials must need not to break out the war again."
2814,"I think that text book which is used in junior high schools and high schools should be written in the very right things. Of course, there are so many different interpretations among people. It is because interpretations are changed, depending on the individuals who feel differently on the same situations. But historical facts which Japan occurred could not be changed. For example, Japan government has an intention to legitimate the incident which did holocaust in Nankin in China. I understand many misunderstandings by Chinese bother Japan. But in Japan students are not taught about such things in detail. Thus we students want to know about the right historical facts and government should be more obedient to the historical facts."
2815,"I think education is very important. For children, adults are absolute so if adults teach wrong thing, children would believe. In this case, people who live in the area hate Tokyo because of their wrong education. I think the right of option for education is in people live in the area."
2816,I think that we have an each opinion on war. It is bad that some people reject other people's opinion. We should respect people's opinion.
2817,"After reading this article, I feel that I don't know what the war in Okinawa is like and we should forget it and tell next generations. In order to do so ,we must study status of Okinawa. Japanese education put importance on Okinawa."
2818,I know the war has a some reason. After all the war is prohibited.
2819,i am afraid of president. Okinawa is the important place. so he should be more careful.
2820,"When I read this article, I feel that we should learn more about World War Two. In japan, there are few people who went through the war. So, we must ask them the story about the war to understand the terror of wars before they died.We must also transmit the terror of wars to posterity. I hope wars will disappear from the world."
2821,"We can get many informations easily and early in contemporary information society. Gaining information by using internet is very convenient definitely. But there are some informations which has a bad influence on children's education or is aggressive content such abusing. I think that erasing some aged and harmful informations for people though freedom of expression is indispensable to protect human rights. However, we should restrain ourselves from uploading impertinent information and internet search engine is necessary to censor websites whether there is bad information. If we keep in mind to use internet carefully not to hurt feelings of internet users, we can enjoy using internet comfortably."
2822,"I think simple is the best. Because efficient things are very beautiful and SIMPLE. I do not need any extra information, People do not often check the vocabulary notes so extra information makes me confused."
2823,"I know the war has a some reason. Of course the war is prohibited. However, it is not a bad thing to tell about war even if that war is bad. This is because we must not forget terror of the war. So, I think that the education to teach misery of the war should be done from now on."
2824,"The modern information-intensive society was very convenient and brought us profit.However, the problem occurs as information-intensive society develops.We will have to think about use of the Internet deeply some other time.I want to use it as convenient contents without troubling another person."
2825,"We should think of the pain of people whose personal information is betrayed. They are suffering from being on the Internet forever. This is very painful problem. Although there is one viewpoint that we have the right to know information, we should also consider the feelings of such people. It is the age of Information technology. In such era, it is necessary to build basic privacy policy that protects human rights on the Internet."
2826,"Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. But, everyone can't violate the privacy rights. I think that we should give preference to protect privacy over freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is used for people. With this case as a start, we need to know about the potential dangers of the Internet. It was impossible for Internet offering to vanish."
2827,"We should be care about the personal information does not leak to the network society when we use the internet.The modern network society is essential to our lives,but there are many parts you do not know yet.This is most dangerous to use the internet.Obtaining the information from the site of no credibility and putting the information of others without permission is source of leaking to personal information. It is important to understand danger of network society to use the internet.We should consider the privacy rights of the individual with the public's right to know and distribute information."
2828,"Now, we live in a world surrounded by a lot of information,and it isn't too much to say that this is the age of information technology,that is Internet users have been coming thick and fast and easily obtain a tremendous amounts of information. Although it is necessary to respect one's rights of privacy,it is exceedingly difficult to classify what is important information and what is not.For everybody has his or her own thought,a sense of value and so forth. So, on one hand we have to think about one's own privacy,on the other hand we should distribute information with a mind not to harm one's feeling."
2829,"It is true that the right to know information is important. However, the Internet is new, so we could live without information about things far from us. On the contrary, we can be sick mentally if we are known about us reluctantly. Because of these thoughts, I think that the right to be protected our own information is more important than the right to know it."
2830,"When I read this article, I felt this was a very serious problem. This is because it was difficult to balance the privacy rights with the public's right to know. It is true that all of us should get information which we want to know ,however, I think we need to have consideration for other people who don't want them to know. Therefore, I think privacy is more important than freedom of expression because I have heard a lot of troubles about privacy ever before. For example, if our privacy information such as debt is known to everyone, we may feel serious mentally shock. This is very difficult matter, so I think it's the most important for us to think about what we should do toward this problem."
2831,"In modern society, we can know a lot of information. But we don't say the problem is true, and it is difficult to distinguish the difference. The influence of internet is terrible, so we are told to use it carefully. However, if people are too anxious, they can't use the right to know. The relation of expression and privacy is difficult problem. We must use internet to know beneficial information."
2832,"When I was read this article, I felt this problem was so difficult. I think both the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for all people. However, these are contrary each other relating to what it secure. In this case, it is not the best that we judge Google is wrong. Because that this ruling threatening freedom of expression is fact. I'm going to watch the battle between Europe and America over the balance between privacy and freedom of expression."
2833,"These days, there are many problems which caused by Internet. For example, hacking, addictive online game, and about personal privacy. And I think personal privacy can't be indifferent to us. It is because a lot of people, particularly the young, using SNS. For instance, twitter, Facebook and so on. those SNS are interesting for us, but those are also dangerous to use. So, it is good for us to get the right to remove out comments and photos on SNS."
2834,"When I read this article, I thought that this problem is very difficult. Because there is the conflict between people's rights to know and the privacy rights of individuals. Thus I think the both rights are important for us. For instance, we need to know about politicians which govern us in order to elect better people in the parliamentary democracy. In addition to this, someone who are eager to remove the information including privacy should have the right to erase that. Like photos which are taken unwillingly. Base on the above I think that the most important thing is our understanding that the internet is public and every people can see. So we should be always careful about what we are going to do in the internet."
2835,"Today, various information came to be exchanged on the Internet and became the very convenient world. But, the current information-intensive society is not necessarily only convenient. Especially, it is that personal information flows out. Like this news, the thing about the personal information is the one of having to pay attention. All the things which we can do is not to write in personal information easily on the Internet."
2836,"It is difficult problem between the right to know and privacy.I think that the problem is occurred by the fact that people do not know the precise border of these . For instance when one person insist on the privacy rights, a problem would come under privacy.But it is also able to come under the case of the right to know. Even if the news is not true, the news is so worse as to spread widely to people on the Internet. I suppose that is the most fearful point .In my opinion,the privacy rights is more important than the right to know.Because there is no way protecting the privacy rights without erasing infomation.But in case of the right to know,there are many ways people get infomation.It is true that the Internet is so convenience getting a lot of information,but people should understand that it is not always that say correct things.People should get information using many ways,and need to compare these ."
2837,"In my opinion, building the law which is written in this article is not collect. Although the Internet causes many problems, it is true that we take many benefits from it. We can share a lot of information,buy something,work in our house and know a lot of things. Before building the law of limiting the Internet, we should make right attitude of using the Internet.Without our wrong attitude, there are no problems of the Internet.I think the people who don't have 'Internet manner' shouldn't use the Internet."
2838,"This article is associated with various human rights.They are freedom of expression,free speech,the right to privacy and public right of access to information.Google concluded that they took the measure of whether the information is personal or relevant to public interests.Though it seems to be reasonable,it is horrific for Google as a general firm to have the option to release information.So Google will be able to erase the information that has embarrassing problem for it.This regard may be a moot point."
2839,"Nowadays, we can use the Internet easily by using computers and cellphones,and we can get a lot of information from the Internet. the Internet is very useful, but we have to be careful about how to use the Internet. In Japan, many people use SNS, for example, twitter, Facebook and LINE. We can communicate with people all over the world by using SNS. However, there is the danger that our personal information leaks out. So, We must learn how danger the Internet is, and protect our personal information by ourselves."
2840,"With the spread of the Internet,personal information has been exposed to danger more.Of course,the Internet makes our life easy and convenience.However,leaking out our information may lead us to the irreparable accident.Therefore, we should be careful about disclosing personal information. There are various kinds of opinions about right to be forgotten.I think the most important thing is protecting users.I hope the Internet will be safe for all those users."
2841,"In this news, the European Court of Justice made its landmark ruling search engines to save 'right to be forgotten'. It means individuals have the rights to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. On the other hand, though Google agrees this opinion in public, they point out two things. First, this ruling has possibility to threaten 'free speech'. Second, individual interest isn't same as public interest. I think Both of them have right opinions. But I'm for the Google's opinion. because we use the Internet after understanding some risks. if you want to delete your embarrassing photos, you shouldn't upload them. At the present time, we can lock our accounts in SNS. I think not a system but manners are needed now."
2842,"I think it important for our privacy to be protected. It is because our privacy is equivalent to our lives. If our privacy spread to the world, our lives is open to danger. It is true that the freedom of our expression is important for us and it also should be protected. But, when we compare former to latter, we probably think former more important than latter, that is, our privacy should be protected more carefully than the freedom of our expression."
2843,"Today,many people use social network services such as Facebook or Twitter.Through them,it is possible to know what a friend did in yesterday,where a celebrity went or what a strange man wants to do.This means that we are monitored by everyone.I think that we have the right to freedom of expression,but we must care about comments on the internet.Careless comments will cause serious troubles.We should learn how to use the internet and guard the own privacy."
2844,"Recently the number of people using the Internet is becoming bigger, so the problem between the privacy and the freedom of expression. I think it is danger to lean toward the one party between the right of privacy and the freedom of the expression. I suppose that nowadays a lot of people are looking just at the freedom of the expression . People should pay more attention to the right of the privacy because there are a lot of crime on the Internet and their privacy could be invaded."
2845,"The issue about the balance between privacy and freedom of expression is very difficult to solve because both are important. However if I have to decide which is more important, I choose privacy. It's age of the internet now. We can know information about individuals with the internet. It means it's possible to be known our privacy by many people. Freedom of expression should be limited to live with sense of security."
2846,"I think it is a very difficult and complicated problem to balance the privacy rights of individual with information distribution.Maybe, there are no solutions to manage this problem.For example google says it investigate whether there is a public interest in the links users want removed.However, there are many people on the internet who severely attack other individuals who are seemed to be guilty and strange. Google and other search engines are needed to solve one by one problems."
2847,"This article makes me think deeply about the use of information from the Internet. On the Internet, there is a lot of bad information for children, but they don't know how to keep away from them. And not only children but also adults are put in danger of losing their privacy. Of course the freedom of expression is very important, but if we access so bad information or lose our privacy, our safe life may be deprived. This is more dangerous situation, so I think some kinds of restriction is necessary to protect our good life."
2848,"The problem of the balance between privacy and freedom of expression is difficult. However, I think privacy should be respected and individuals should be able to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. The Internet is very convenience but so terrible. Information spread wider and it is left longer than we think. There are very important and private information on the Internet, so I think that the ruling is necessary to some extent."
2849,"Today, we can get many kind of information,including someone´s private information which can be harmful for the person. So, the search giant, such as Google,should not let people search someone´s privacy unless the person allows people to do it . However, we have to remember that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and protect it."
2850,"I think that the privacy should have priority over the freedom of expression. If our privacy is leaked on the Internet, some people may abuse it and we will suffer heavy damage on the financial or mental damage. Thus,I think Google's decision was right."
2851,"Internet is convenient and we can get a lot of information easily if we use this.However,we may impress badly if we don't use it suitably. We must know how to use it surely. Many people in all over the world are using internet.So a lot of problem occur. However, our private information or problem mustn't open to the public.Thus,these have to be protected from this danger. In addition, we must remember that everyone has the right to freedom of expression and protect it. Thereby, it is necessary to receive Google's decision."
2852,"I have been convinced that Google attitude for this time judgment. Because this problem is too important. Many unspecified persons look the information on web site. Since the past information is always accumulated, it may differ from the present information. So it often change to an obstacle of a certain person's life. Now, information is power. I think that it is not good to erase information easily by only Google. This is a big problem that we consider all together."
2853,"In this age of Internet,we can get various information about anything.It is so convenience,but the other aspect,it is dangerous and privacy is remarkably easy to be leaked. And I think many people lack sense of crisis to release our own information on Internet,for example Face book. Therefore we have to protect own information.So I think the right to forget is important."
2854,"Today we can get any information from the internet. But it is sure that there is informations like having bad influences for young ages. However we must regard about freedom of expression. So, before uploading any informations we must think how other people feel when they see these informations."
2855,"I disagree with the ruling. Because, the right to be forgotten could strengthen the hand of repressive governments. Between governments and social media have an interest in rights. So, governments should guarantee free speech. But, We also should learn how to use internet. We must be careful, don't leak of information. Having done that I think we don't need the right to be forgotten."
2856,"I agree with 'right to be forgotten', which is to erase data that individuals no longer wish to be in public.If I meet someone and tell him my name, he can search my information online.So it could not protect privacy.We should have human rights to keep our privacy a secret. However government and politician's information have to be free for us to search because we should also have right to know."
2857,"I think that this ruling is wrong in some ways.It is true that our privacy should be protected.However,we should not belittle the influence of this ruling.Freedom of expression is essential for democracy.We need to have the rights to criticize our government.If we had not freedom of expression,we could not avoid personal dictatorship.We have to pay attention to a leak of privacy by ourselves when we use the Internet."
2858,"I think search engines should listen to people who want links about them removed, because we have to protect our privacy. However, we shouldn't leak our information easily. Although we think it is less amount of our privacy, it can be the hint which suggest to our important information, for example, our passwords."
2859,"I agree with the 'right to be forgotten' . Today, many people use SNS in Internet, connecting with all over the world. No one is perfect, so people often contribute wrong (or inappropriate) articles to SNS. Therefore, many people want to clean their murky past from their SNS. For this reason, I think it is nonsense to condemn the 'right to be forgotten' even though many people need the right."
2860,"In this article,the right to be forgotten threatens free speech particular in America.Although free speech will be threatened,I think that our privacy should be protected.In recent years,our privacy has been threatened."
2861,"When I read this article. I think that we should use internet considering its merit and problem, because internet may be dangerous. in fact internet is fun, but if we use internet mistakenly, we will be in trouble."
2862,"When I read this article,I was shocked to know labors' unfortunate circumstances.I think that the corporation should give them the treatments with human dignity.The company close their eyes to labors' suffering in order to make much profit.In a capitalistic country,you may seek profit.However,treating labors as animals is inadmissible.The government has to enact laws which protect the human rights of labors.Employers always want to exploit workers for inadequate pay as far as the law permits."
2863,"When I read this article, I think it is very difficult problem. certainly the privacy right is important thing, but we must not neglect the right to know. To solve this conflict,it is important to talk each other and compromise."
2864,"I understand that links make ex-convict's life more difficult.But I disagree with the statement that people have the right to be forgot. It is true that many pictures which were taken without awareness are on the Internet.However, most people don't have links that they want to remove.Nomal lives doesn't produce such links.So the right is unnecessary.It has no problem unless they commit a crime."
2865,"I was very surprised that slave labor is still happening. Indeed, there were black slaves previously the 1960s, and owners had produced a product by activating the slaves human trafficked in human beings. However, it should have banned that the slavery all over the world the present day. This practice will deprive of human rights. Why can they do easily an outrage action like this. I can understand that they want to get a lot of profit in production and exports , but it is incorrect to enslave workers in order that. I think that they should review the production process properly."
2866,"This article said that employment relationships (in all over the world) are very severe. I think this problem is happened in Japan too. To solve this problem, I think country's government should make laws about employment. Probably there are laws about it, but it isn't sufficient to protect labours. So I think government should strengthen the laws. For example, these days, there are problems about overtime work. So, how about regulate working time strictly, or pay for overtime work appropriately."
2867,"Reading this article,I felt 'How terrible and appalling situation this is!' This is definitely exploitation. Of course I can understand that underpaid laborers are needed in terms of cost reduction,but I presume that fundamental human right should be respected at the same time. Human beings are different from animals in that they can think logically and speak language .If we third person continually connive at this situation ,it isn't too much to say that we let the laborers die. It's not humanitarian.So we should take measure for this situation."
2868,"When I read this article, I was really shocked and surprised. Although I learned about the hard situation about shrimp industry, however, that's main point was environmental issue about mangrove so I didn't have enough knowledge about workers. Therefore, I think this time was very valuable because I came to know that how terrible their situation is ! Shrimp is my favorite food but I don't want them to work so hard and I think we all have to think this problem as very serious and find the way to improve their lives. If such problem about food is going to be more and more worse,then we cannot live in the same way as now. For example, consumers try not to buy so many shrimps then there will be less need for slave workers to work too hard. It is the most important for everyone in the world to live 'their' lives."
2869,"I was shocked to read this article for the first time because I probably eat prawns, shrimp and other foods which are produced in the situation like this everyday not knowing about slave labour. Many businesses, not only them of foods but also them of other industries, have been becoming multinational corporations to seek the economical labor force. They build many factories in countries whose standard of wages is low. However, I think they must consider the situation of labour and mustn't forget that labours are human beings. Wherever they work in, their human rights have to be secured."
2870,"We should have a query about cheaper imports. There are cheaper labors behind cheaper imports. It develops a strong tendency to use cheap labor with the progress of globalization. Ideally, we consume local production. Now, we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. I'll take quality over quantity. We stop depending on overseas cheaper labors."
2871,"On the morning of the day I have read this article, I ate the shrimps which my family had bought in COSTOCO.So, when I read this article, I was surprised, and I felt that I have a close relation to this news.I was shocked at still using people like slave.I didn't know the back ground of the shrimps I always eat are such a cruel systems.The company of shrimp must abolish this system of slave labor immediately.If many men are handled of slave, I don't want to eat the shrimps and I would not like buy other shrimps.I think, many companies are thinking methods for how to sell cheap shrimp, how to sell a lot of shrimp from other companies. But that methods of using slave laborer wrong.For stopping the system,consumers don't buy such shrimps. I think that gives the most damage for the company, it would be effective,however,being realization is so difficult .Because consumers have priority over not solve problem but the price.I got the chance that I heard the problem,so I should tell the fact for many people. Because,the foods we eat have a relation to slave labor's prpblem.Many people know this fact is important at first.Thinking of Governments, they can prohibit the system of slave labor,and they don't permit to sell such a shrimp.Moreover they decide the lowest price, they don't compete with others for the cheapest prize,and they make a rule of labor's system,and condition ,saving the people like slave. I suppose these are tied with saving the slave laborers."
2872,"When I read this article, I was shocked and astonished very much. I did not know about this at all although I often eat shrimp which are imported from those countries. I felt myself shameful and remorse for those countries' people. In these days, it seems that there is a society without no discrimination for gender and ethnic group. But I do not think so definitely. I feel there is clearly racial and sex discrimination in the world. Once I visited abroad, I felt discrimination for me as Asian people. One shopkeeper recommended tasting service for Caucasians who are in the line before me. On the other hand, the shopkeeper did not recommend the same thing for our family and the other Asian people who are in the line behind us. I felt very sad and understood this is the reality. In addition to this, I feel sex discrimination definitely. I joined to the extracurricular club whose ratio of boys and girls is 5 to 1. Naturally men are given priority and girls cannot be understood about girls' own troubles and there are almost no considerations for girls. There are still clear discriminations in the world and we must abolish the system as soon as possible."
2873,"When I read this article,I got surprised at using slave labor to make shrimps.If we eat that shrimp ,we will be buying produce of slave labor.That means we agree with slavery.That is probably reluctant for us. Moreover it is unethical to use them because they pay no attention to their human rights. So I would like to suggest that Japanese government should stop importing that shrimp and also make that shrimp industry give up using slave labor."
2874,"This article surprised me very much. I have learned the bad conditions of farmers such as coffee and cacao.However, I didn't know the fact of shrimp.This problem should be resolved as soon as possible. But it is very difficult.We,consumers,want to buy the cheaper product. So farmers and corporations must make an effort to make their products cheaper.They can't stop using slaves. Thus we are involved in the problem.We should know it and change our action."
2875,"When I read this article, I was very shocked at slave labor being used in the sever condition. Although I know there are discrimination in the world, I didn't think such a terrible situation. It will be difficult Japan stop importing shrimp from their countries, so the government should make regulations which protect human rights and control the company strictly."
2876,"When I read this article, I was surprised and frightened at the circumstance of slave labour in shrimp industry in Thailand. Why are there such captive labourers? Why are they sold like animals and are forced into unfair labour? Which should we respect as human beings, them or shrimp? Then, I questioned media response to the reality in Japan. This news should be known all over the world. I hope the day they can work in appropriate condition as human beings will come."
2877,"When I read this article, I was really surprised. I didn't know the fact that the fishmeal suppliers use slave labour. Using slave labour should not be permitted. We must respect each other's human rights. We have to do something to get the fishmeal suppliers to stop using slave labour. I think the best way to get them to stop using slave labor is that government enact a law about working condition, and regulate working condition. I hope that slave labour will disappear from this world."
2878,"When I read this article, I think it is serious big problem. I am against with this ruling. It is because the right could strengthen the hand of repressive governments. If I can choose which is more important, I think I will choose privacy. There are a lot of dangerous and risky things in internet. I think we should more careful about privacy."
2879,"When I read this article, I was so surprised to the fact that slave labourers are killed. And then, I remembered the TV program I watched last year. The program was about children's labourers in India. In developing countries, companies need make things cheap and make much profit. They use slaves to pay cut. However, the fact isn't known to us, who buy their goods. We should know more about these present circumstances."
2880,"When I read this article, I think this is very hurtful news and I was shocked. I've never know that they are working very so hard. They are working like slaves to make shrimps which we will eat. I think it should be changed. I think the company should care about our human right. We should abolish this working system now."
2881,"It is the main problem in this article that is the fact that the world STILL allows people to use slave labour. Slave labour should have been eliminated, but is still. Using slave labour has many problems that people who are limited to work have no rights, aren't paid properly, etc. In modern world it is natural for people to be free. But we think it too natural. Therefore, we don't have intention to see the world. The world is still irrational, so if we intend to see the world situation, we don't notice the world's irrationality. In this article, examples include Shrimp Industry, but in others situations there are slave labour problems. And we should intend to understand the problems."
2882,"I was surprised at the fact that there is still slave labour now.Speaking of slave labour,most of us image African slave.It was an injustice one and banned 19th century.I learned such history,so I thought all slaves completely disappeared. In this situation,developed countries should do something.For example,we should indicate an error of this system and should not buy shrimps from Thailand.There are many other solution strategies,but the most important thing is getting rid of slaves completely."
2883,"When I read this news,I was surprised at using slave labours in shrimp indusry.It is natural that some companies want to sell at a price cheaper than other companies.However,we must not use slave labour at any time.I think what kind of person should be treated as a person.This is because that anyone in the world have the human rights.I think that Japanese media did not response this news quickly,because they think the news will have any effect on consumers buying shrimp.I hope that the day when all people can live in equality comes."
2884,"When I read this article, I was surprised and become sad. I didn't know that they were in such a situation. The slave is the system that there must not be. You must think that we cooperate and defeat such situation. The media should react to such situation as one means. If repeat a steady thing, change the situation; will help it. I think that it is important that it continues and acts."
2885,"From this article, we can learn two things. First,there is the fact that our lives are supported by others. Although this is the extreme case, there is a lot of others' sacrifice. We must realize that how a lot of benefit we owe others. Second, we recognize the system of slave labor. Let me assure you that nobody like cheap products. So, although we think that we shouldn't have slave labor, few of us take actions. So we should take action to cut down the number of the slave labor."
2887,"I was shocked to read this news.I have not known how shrimps which are sold in supermarkets are produced.There are many slave labours who are treated as animal in shrimp industry.This problem is related to Japanese because we buy prawns or shrimps at SEIYU or other supermarkets.In Japan,however,few people know this fact.I think we should become aware of this problem.We just can do is taking action to protect slave labour's right.I hope the shrimp industry produce foods without using slave labours."
2888,"It was quite shocking to see that there are still slavery remaining to this day. I knew that slavery existed during the Civil War, but I never knew that slavery existed in the 21st century. Slavery violates human rights in every way, and there should be severe punishment to slave owners. It is also disgusting to know that the shrimp and prawns from Thailand set on supermarkets are the 'produce of slavery.' Since this concerns not only Thailand, but the countries around Thailand, we should figure out a way to stop slavery and save these people on board."
2889,"I was so surprised at the news that some of our daily food is based on slave labor and shocked how terrible the present situation of slave labor is. I suggest that we,that is ,the consumer refuse to buy the commodity of company which handle slaves terribly for their interest."
2890,"The truth that shrimps which we unintentionally eat in daily life is raised by large numbers of men bought and sold like animals and held against their will on fishing boats surprised me.Especially I was shocked at the severe working conditions that can lead labors to death.I can't believe such a thing is possible in this modern society. Since we consumers eat cultured shrimps,we have to consider the workers who are related the process and choose the one which the workers are concerned."
2891,"I have thought that there are no slavery today, so I was shocked when I read this article. Not only me , almost everyone think there are no slavery today, I suppose. There are a lot of serious problems , for example, environmental problem, a food shortage , and poverty. That's why we miss the problem of slavery. I think everyone have equal right ,so employers have to pay fair wage to them. We should make efforts to look at problem hidden by main serious problem."
2892,"I hadn't been imagined that many slaves worked to get fishmeal in horrific situation until I read this article. This fact should be known for Japanese people, because imported foods are related with our life. To solve this problem, governments should make international regulation which prohibits sell food products which use slave labour. Also consumers should research details of products, for example, price, place of origin."
2893,"I have already known that there are some suppliers that use slave labour. However I thought they are minority,and most of suppliers are not using, so the news about CP foods, the world's largest shrimp farmer, surprised me. I mustn't buy things from bad suppliers like CP foods to protect people from the labor in horrific conditions."
2894,"When I read this article, I think it is cruel that supplier use slave labors.They treats labors as animal. If they does this in japan, they must be charged. We are part of the world and we are friends, so we should think this problem as our friend's problem. Human rights should be respected all over the world. I think slave system must be abolished."
2895,"Consumers have to understand that we may have participated in forced labor indirectly, and have to take action. This news that the food eating every day might be morally made by the bad method made consumers anxiety and grief . At the result, sales of related goods decreased . However, it will not become solution only by economic sanctions and refrain buying. It is necessary to make laws that indicate the rule of the process until food reaches consumers."
2896,"I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible."
2897,"I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. Even if they want work force, I think that it is wrong to treat a human being like an animal. If an individual less thinks about human rights, we cannot anticipate the improvement of the situation, but I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible."
2898,"I think slave labour are used not only in shrimp industry but in various industries. I have seen the documentary video about Indian child labour in factories and mines.It is very very serious problem and we must consider the laws and projects that prohibit these unethical labour.The most effective actions about unethical labour is to buy only fair trade goods and not to buy tremendously cheap goods in supermarkets. However most people think it is impossible.Therefore I think it is the important first step to attract the interest of lots of people about these unethical labour. Improving labour environment will take a long time, but we must change these cruel situation."
2899,"I can't believe even in the modern world, some people were forced to work and not paid like slaves. According to the article, workers are treated like animals in their terrible work environment. It is true. We should face up to reality. However, Japanese government or companies would not wrestle with the problem actively. That's because Seafood consumption in Japan depends on imports from south east Asia. Perhaps such forced labour would contribute to cheap price in Japan, which makes us happy. Before we claim the human rights and dignity, we should reconsider our attitude."
2900,This article will shock the world. We should criticise such an inhumane working. I warn Thailand government to research about this issue and They must force CP foods to close the factory.
2901,"'If you buy prawns or shrimp from Thailand, you will be buying the produce of slave labour,' this word was very impressive for me. We are apt to buy cheep goods without thinking anything, but retailers may use forced labor like this news. To solve this problem, watch agency should be in place in an appropriate manner in all labor market. And we should continue investigation whether supermarkets use slave labor. I hope that terrible things will disappear from all over the world."
2902,"I was surprised and shocked at labor using slaves is still being.In developing country, they want to cut costs as possible as they can.So, they uses slaves.We should stop to import shrimps from their country but we can't because of shrimp demand. The only thing we can do is we know more about such a circumstance and thanks for the food."
2903,"Reading this article, I remembered the story of 'The Cannery Boat (KANIKOSEN)', which is about people forced to work like slaves. I was surprised to see that such painful situations still exist today. I felt angry at old-fashioned way of capitalists' treating workers. In the flaw of globalization, we should respect and consider them, which is the contemporary way of working."
2904,"When I read this article , I was shocked and surprised at using slave labor. Although I often eat shrimps, I didn't know such a terrible thing. To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world!"
2905,"When I read this article,I think there was something similar to what happened to current Thailand in Japan.That is the yarn-making factories which was privately-owned in the Meiji era. From the view point of modern people,there seemed to be extremely oppressive work and exploitation in the factories which were pursuing the biggest benefit.It is said that the daughters who was born into country cropper family were delivered to the yarn-making factories.We should deeply think about the work of international migrant workers."
2917,"In Japan,we can't see slavery labour, but in fact today there is this labour.This labour should be banned. It will kill more and more people.So it should be restrained."
2924,"I tried to make word book by the second and third ways. However, it takes a quite long time. Recently, I have had a lot of English homework. I have not have enough time to collect words by these ways. Therefore, I have made my vocabulary note by the first way. I think that first of all, I need to make a more efficient plan about what I should do and to carry out my own plan."
2926,"In this news, there are still slave labour in shrimp industry. And the global retailers like Seiyu sells us a lot of shrimps that they bought from CP foods. And CP foods were supplied by shrimp industry using slave labour. US and UK responded this terrible fact quickly. But their medias were anxious about their effect on consumers buying shrimp. So they remained to be seen this. When I read this article, I was very surprised and thought, 'I can't believe slave labour still exists !'. But in our living cities, many things are sold for unbelievable low prices. We should feel sorting is wrong when we buy them. But I guess many people don't even know this fact. So I think it is important for saving people who work slavery to know this fact."
2927,i am very surprised at this news. i like shrimp . so i should think this news very much.
2932,"I use the Internet every day. Therefore, the Internet manners must protect. The Internet is also convenient and has also entailed danger. since -- careful cautions are required."
2933,"Okinawa is some Japan. Now, the problem of the right of collective self-defense is subject. When war occurs, the place which is related first of all is Okinawa. The problem of Okinawa is not every person."
2942,"I have known a little about slave labour but I didn't know so cruel like that. This industrial system is profitable only for developed countries and ignore the human right of people in developing countries. And those who buy the products from the suppliers using slave labour are accomplices. It is the industry that makes all the people who are relevant to that happy, so we must consider how to solve this problem hard and as soon as possible."
2943,"When I hear the news,I became angry to the lack of consciousness about women's standpoint. However,the action of throwing eggs was incorrect. We should control our feelings and careful what one says and does at any time."
2947,"I think that political corruption in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly was exposed by this problem. Akihiro Suzuki heckled rashly not thinking how Ayaka Shiomura is feeling. Moreover He told a lie that he hadn't heckled. They are disgraceful actions as a human. However, throwing eggs at his office was incorrect and not wise way of protesting. It's a childish action and disgraceful, too."
2949,"I think that it is difficult to determine whether it is right for current us because there is really little what person was experiencing this war. However, we must not forget it about war and think that I have a duty to try to do right understanding. You must write the truth to the right textbook which is used at school so that it is understood. I think that you must let children study the truth. As well as a thing of Okinawa, I think that it is necessary to let the nation do right understanding about the war whole to prevent a thing same as twice from happening."
2950,"When I looked this news, I was surprised very much that such a thing still happened.This is because,though movement to get rid of slavery is taking place all over the world, it really existed. I think that it is wrong to make a person unhappy only for the thought that they want to be cheaper. I think that Many people eat sold prawns without knowing this fact I think that it is important that even slightly many people know this fact to solve this problem even a little."
2951,"I was shocked when I heard the news.I cannot his sexist heckling.He cannot understand what politicians should do for the people in Japan.Becoming politicians means representative of the people.Therefore, they should work hardly for the people.I do not want the people like him who has no responsibility as politicians.I can understand the action of throwing eggs.I think that it means anger of women.However, they had better to be more calm and consider how to represent their anger."
2957,"The consciousness reform about a woman is required in Japan. Although the Abe Administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are assist female activity by means of only words, there is little actual action. Ms. Shiomura had sued this problem for Parliament. However, she was insulted. This case clarified that sex discrimination was very strong, although democratization spread in Japan. Probably, not only the Japanese but overseas' people was disappointed. In the present social system women will be unable to engage to work and raise their children simultaneously. The Japanese male should get to know a woman's difficulty, and should change recognition."
2961,"I think lawmakers who heckled Ms. Shinzo should apologize her and all women properly. Why do they say such insulting remarks even the social advancement of women has become common in the world? Statements like 'Hurry up and get married' and 'Can't you have a baby?' are very rude for women who can't get married and keep doing inferiority treatment. The circumstance that sexism hasn't vanished in Japan makes me angry. Some men disdain women and blame later marriages and infertility in Japan yet, but I want them to say that women bear men including them."
2962,"I know this news before reading this article. Akihiro Suzuki shouldn't have shouted 'Hurry up and get married' and 'Can't you have a baby?' at her. Not only women but also men have responsibility for the problem of the declining birth rate. A woman can't have a baby without a man. So, men also have responsibility. It is difficult to solve this problem, but we have to solve this problem as soon as we can."
2963,"I felt Ayaka Shiomura was poor because Akihiro Suzuki told her such a terrible thing.I agree with mass-media that made this matter big.If we don't know that case and make it controversial,she probably cannot be apologized by him. However there is a man who made such remarks. Moreover I thought there are many people who were heckled so badly. So I suggest that lawmakers should make a law that prohibit heckling like this, and also the government should proceed with the Gender Equality to eliminate such a sexist heckling."
2970,"I have known this news before because remarks made by lawmakers have become focus of intense media interest. When I first hear this news, I was very shocked as a woman. Our country, Japan is not as equal between men and women as other countries, such as Iceland, Finland and Norway. According to this article, the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe promises to boost the role of working women, however, I think it takes very long time to achieve the words. Needless to say, the situation that there are men who jeer toward women should be improved promptly. In this news, it was the worst action for Akihiro Suzuki not to apologize at first. I think all of the lawmakers have to be more responsible as leaders of many people in Japan. In my nearly future, I am going to work after graduating from Keio university, so I hope such situation would be better than now. Anyway, we all have to understand that women don't have equality of status with men, and reconsider what we should perform in our society."
2977,"I watched the news that a Diet member jeered a sexist heckling.It is true that heckling was regarded as a trademark of Diet.However,sexist heckling became permissible as times change.Therefore,we should watch our language about especially discrimination against women.On the other hand,lawmakers' jobs are to make laws.Their jobs are not looking for the culprit.I desire for my heart that they do their original jobs."
2979,"I knew this news since before having learned it by a class. The sexual harassment in the workplace becomes the social problem today. In the situation, it is a very deplorable thing that a politician left economy of Japan to had the issue of sexual harassment. My friend received sexual harassment from a school teacher before and changed school. Therefore, for such a problem, I cannot help hiding anger. I want Representative Suzuki to resign as a politician as soon as possible. However, I want him to pay the special attention not to cause such a problem if he remain a politician."
2984,"In Japan, we haven't take the problem 'sexual harassment' so seriously. I think this case had often occurred till lately in Japan, so some people may think that it is surprising that this case was taken so seriously. However, in foreign countries, I think sexual harassment are very taboo. Now, it is said to be important that women should work equally to men, we should also take it important how women can work comfortably."
2987,"I can't forgive his remark. 'Can't you have a baby?' This comment is the worst for every woman which they can't have a baby. I was shocked , hearing this comment. People have any troubles and worries, so he have no right to say like that. Although a lot of Japanese women are forced to work and keep house at the same time, a lot of Japanese men only work and don't keep house at the same time. Abe's policy of economy is welcomed, however there is more important point of helping and increasing the birth rate.That point mean systems of equal balance of keeping house between men and women. When I study the problem of a declining birthrate, many woman would like to work. So government should not only help their economy but also make the systems that woman can work comfortably. Many women think If they have a baby, they can't work. A government should make companies make a system which not only women but men can take a child care rest more easily."
2998,"In japan, there was a culture that men work mad women do housework. I think the basic cause of low birth rate is this culture. Recently Japanese women began to work in office. But they have to balance her works and housework. On the other hand, men only work and don't do housework. This is problem. It is natural that women think if she has a baby, she can't work. So government should make a system that women can work more comfortably, for example system that men can take rest for taking care of his baby easily. And it is also necessary that men understand more about difficulty of women's balance of works and housework."
3000,"Treating men and women equally is timeless agenda for Japan.The convention of ancient times,predominance of men over women still exists in parts of Japanese society.The idea that men only work and the women do housework is one of it.Japanese government should do two things.As the stage of women's advance into society has been practically arranged,in the next place they should create a nurturing environment.And besides they should also offer the environment to go back easily after child rearing."
3001,"The words ''Hurry up and get married'' and ''Can't you have a baby?'' are prejudice and criticism Japanese women working as a career woman. And, I can't understand why Akihiro Suzuki lied that he didn't make such remarks. I want him to have a responsibility as a politician. Japan behind other countries in terms of sexual equality. A government should establish concrete policy. However, it's not good to consider prepare only woman's environment for work because men and women work together. I hope people work without thinking about gender."
3007,"When I hear this story, I was so shocked and felt that we must care of other countries taboos because we are likely to be arrested for doing taboo things, so if I go abroad, I want to check the countries taboo before I go. I studied various taboo on this class, so I want to study other countries taboos."
3011,"I think Google's decision was good. Indeed we have the right to know and information should be put on view, but we also have the right to make our disgraceful information be secret, moreover, delete it completely. This is why if we are unable to delete the data or information which we think shameful, we may suffer a serious loss in the future. For example, a 4th grade university student whose bad information is kept on the Internet database may be rejected by the company not on a basis of his ability or skill but on a basis of his conduct of the past. Taking into account the impact on the society in the future, we should be given the right to make what we don't want to be revealed invisible."
3012,"When I heard this news, I felt depressed about Mr. Suzuki's heckle. Also, I thought that this heckle was what cannot be helped because Ms. Shiomura didn't have husband and baby. Eventually, government have all responsibility for help women who working in the society. They should establish policies, for example, completeness of childcare leave and increase of childcare center."
3013,"I was very surprised and felt sad to read this article. We have various points of view respectively, which is quite natural, but we have to make a distinction between the thing which is proper to say and the thing which is improper to say clearly. By the way, I agree with the government's plan to encourage women to go into society much more too. However, as Ms.Shiomura says, the impact of the government's action don't appear enough so far. I think the government should give more power to each prefecture to be able to make an action of promoting women's advance originally."
3015,"When I watched this news, I felt anger in the remark of this man. This is because I could not believe that such a person making a discriminatory remark still exist in Japan though we thought to support a woman spreads out. Of course I agree to a thought of Prime Minister Abe, but think that there is not any meaning that only he insisted on. We spread his thought to more people and think that what We and he do is important for Japan that there is not of such a remark being given twice."
3026,"I think an idea of the Taketomi is very cool. Since Mr.Abe took office as the prime minister, Japan has had a tendency not to regard the war absolutely bad. In addition to this, Tokyo was not the battle field and only places which were invaded seriously can hand down the tragic story to the coming ages. So cities like Taketomi should voluntarily make an original textbook by which children can feel the reality of the war and understand how terrible the war is and consider how to eliminate the battle between or among nations."
3028,"I think that the old generation of men looks down on women very much. And I felt that men forces to have children and the responsibility to the declining birthrate society on women. It is natural for politicians not to be able to take part in good politics,for the recognition of them is such a thing. We should do more education to improve the consciousness to women."
3029,"I think that searching engines needs kind of rights not to forget. Because, public opened information on the Internet limits people's actions. The right to remember should be necessary. People who will not be the criminal are none of their business. People just need to be a polite."
3033,"Certainly, the Diet lawmaker shouldn't heckle someone on the bench. They should listen with concentration to make mention. But, I have a matter of great concern. It is that everyone avoids the difficulty resulting from communication. It's kind of sad that we hesitate to become close together. Of course, we mustn't make hurtful gaffe. Akihiro Suzuki is to be held responsible. On the other hands, in ours private life, I think that we need some jokes in communication. Communities without talking are not interesting. I oppose exclusive attitude."
3034,I also became angry hearing this news. I think what people have to do is not to throw eggs but to make Akihiro Suzuki have a responsibility and apologize to Japanese women.
3035,"This news topic is very controversy one, I think. Of course, it is definitely malicious that the men made (sexual) harassment to the lawmaker Shiomura. But I argue that we should stop to think that what constitutes the concept of 'gender free'. What I want to say is that Shiomura, who is also a writer for TV show programs, herself actually do make a terrible sexual harassment, through TV programs, to teenage girls who are eager to be TV stars, taking advantage of their ambition (like ' I do anything if I can be a top idol!) . But curiously, little criticism is made to this fact. What is important is that we should consider the question 'Is it a sexual harassment if men do not respect women? And what if women neglect women's or men's rights and dignity?' In that point, I felt this news can be valuable discussion topic."
3047,"This article serves us one thing that advanced countries must not look away from realities of developing countries. We may eat shrimps which this article says. developed countries have large amount of money, but developing countries don't have enough. However, developed countries should not squeeze as small money as possible from developing countries. I think that advanced countries would rather improve state of developing countries."
3050,"I have not taking to make useful vocabulary notebooks into consideration. So,I found that making such notebooks make me so easy to learn not only English words but also collocations. In this article, I think forth example is particularly good. Because I often memorize only words that I read in something, but this article may help to give chances to get other words. I want to try to do it."
3052,"Internet is very useful, and it is very familiar with us recently. Everybody has something not to be caught dead for example former pictures. If that is uploaded to Internet, we can't erase that easily. Especially, we,college students,often use SNSs. SNS makes us easy to share everything. We are living cheek by jowl with the danger of this. If we do so, can we do nothing? I think this article may be so a familiar problem with us."
3053,"Equality of the sexes is important, but in Japan, equality of the sexes don't spread. So, what should we do? I think we should eliminate the concept that men and women are different. In this article, the problems include the sexual harassment. If the discriminative concept are eliminated in Japan, the sexual harassment will decrease. Also all over the world, there is the sexual harassment, so we should think about the problems not only in Japan, but also in the world."
3057,"I think we should not say easily that death penalty is bad or it should be banned. It is because death penalty work as prevention not to commit a felony which sentence a person to death. It is sure that people must respect one's freedom to live. However, if there is no death penalty, terrible accident would increase. So I think death penalty is better than increasing a lot of terrible crime."
3058,"I was shocked more than a little to read this article. I noticed women to have been scorned in Japan still. Abe administration are trying to actively supporting women. Nevertheless, It is a pity that Japanese people will not the unity. I think through this problem, it is good if many people are aware of the importance of supporting women more."
3059,"I use Example 2 because all English words give me skills to write or read. But, the practical way to master English is to learn parts of speech, pronunciation, word family and etc. Therefore, I decide to make an effective notebook which includes them."
3061,I was disappointed at this news.I think Akihiro Suzuki should be ashamed of himself.The statement 'can't you have a baby?' is really heartless.We should not be prejudice against women. It is true that there is a gender equality problem.We should be given equality of opportunity.Japan should follow foreign country's example.I hope women will be completely accepted.
3062,"I felt like something doubt the truth of true when I read this article. Children learn history through textbooks. The contents of the textbook must have a significant impact on children. In this article, I was aware of the existence of women tell the meaning of the war. I think there good or bad, but I think I want textbooks to tell the importance of the real war to children."
3072,"This news shows sex discrimination has still existed in Japanese society. Ironically,the Diet has been trying to encourage women to play more active part in the society. However, I doubt that this insulting remarks were uttered by Suzuki Akihiro alone. I suspect this impolite event was happened by more than one person. If my assumption were right, there are still some assemblymen who have careless and unconsidered thoughts in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly. Nonetheless, because of this matter, assemblymen are made to realize again that the Japanese people are indignant at sex discrimination."
3073,"When I read this news, I was very disappointed. And I think this news shows there is still predominance in Japan. Japan has gained gender equality as , but the idea about gender in its society hasn't changed. A short time ago, a Diet member said ' woman is a child bearing machine.' We should be shameful about our representatives said such remarkable."
3075,"I was shocked when I heard this news. Akihiro's remark to Ms.Shinomura is so cruel. If I were heckled by men such, I would have more misery than anger. This case happened to be treated so big by media because it occurred in a Tokyo city assembly session. However, I think such cases because of prejudice against women happened everywhere in Japan. This case is not an accident. In japan, the men's prejudice against woman is still rooted deeply. I hope Abe's policy for women will go well."
3076,"I was surprised that America uses chemicals to do executions and sometimes they lead grotesque scenes. Japan has hanging for death penalty and these ways of capital punishment are both cruel, so I think that we must think more kind way of death penalty."
3079,I was shocked when I heard this news. It is outrageous that a member of the Diet who is the representative of the nation makes jeering of the sexism. I think that Japan cannot catch up with other countries in terms of sex equality because each person's consciousness is not enough. We should make the society which everyone can play an active part without distinction of sex.
3080,"When I hear this condescending remark or attitude,I was very shocked. In Japan ,inequalities between the sexes has still been indicated. It may be true that men have more power than woman in terms of physical and anatomical structure but i think women should be superior to men in some case.So to solve the problems like this case,we should remove the men's prejudice against women.Before it becomes unruly."
3081,This article said that employment relationships all over the world are very serious. I think the problem also is occurred in Japan . I think there are two solutions about this problem. The first is that the government should make laws strict which are related to employment. Probably. the current laws are not sufficient to protect labours. So I think government should strengthen the laws. The second is that each person should know the current situation.
3082,"I was so shocked at this story. if I were a slave labor and forced to work 18 to 20 hours per day for seven days a week , I would dead soon. I wander that the world has another lot of slave labors and they work very very hard today so I want to buy fear trade products when I go shopping."
3084,"Everyone is within there rights to express freedom things. At the same time, however, everyone can't violate the privacy rights. I often use SNS such as twitter, Facebook and mixi. These are very convenient and make our lives enrichment. We have to coexist with these properly."
3085,"I agree with Sadako Nakamura's opinion. The war should not be happened ever. I think that everyone should tell the children truth. By doing so it, I think that we consider this problem carefully and children can do right choice."
3086,"I agree with right to forget . when I published my shameful photo, I want to erase it as soon as possible. At the same time, the freedom of expression of one who surrenders is not protected, so we should think about this problem. Generally, people tend not to like be published their shameful things, so I think that right to forget is winner."
3088,"I have made the vocabulary note when I was high school student. I have to memorize a lot of English vocabularies. So, I made it and read it during commuting time to school and free time. It is so useful because it makes me memorize this vocabulary meaning, pronunciation, part of speech and example sentence. I want to make vocabulary note again to pass English proficiency test."
3089,"When I heard this story, I was so shocked. I think it is really hard to understand the consciousness of religion of other cultures. It is so sensitive and complex problem. So if we go to foreign country ,we must care about manners and customs of that country, especially religion."
3090,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. Japan has death penalty too. We should consider about this problem."
3091,I was surprised to hear this news. This accident is one of the most terrible accident. But It is very bad that the captain who should have responsibility escaped. I think that captain should have responsibility to the passenger's lives and the government should impose a severe punishment on the captain.
3095,The sexist jeers against Shiomura is unbelievable for me. Maybe they didn't say because they were really thinking so. I think they were just kidding. However it's never allowed because they hurt Shiomura's feeling. There are still many people who are pretending not to heckle. I strongly hope they will be honest.
3103,"This news is frequently broadcast and all over the TV news. I think this situation shows how presses are interested in the news. Certainly, Akihiro Suzuki's jeers should be condemned and he should be punished. However, I think Ayaka Shiomura, who was shouted the terrible jeers, is getting carried away. According to other newspapers, she also made careless remarks in several situations, for example on her twitter. I can't understand she emphasize the sexist jeers with her eyes closing to her own faults."
3105,I am skeptical about the right to be forgotten. Search engine such as google is one of the important ways to know what kind of person when hiring someone or in the similar situation. We should learn from the past fault rather than try to erase it.
3108,"I was angry when I watch this news on TV. I am an woman too so if I were heckled, I would did same thing with Ayaka Shiomura. It is a sexual harassment. That is disgrace of Japanese men. I want environment no male chauvinism. We must think about society of equality of the sexes."
3110,I feel sad that there still exist such a things like slavery and human trafficking. We should not allow those inhuman acts and take an active part in trying to abolish those things.
3112,"I think heckling in the congress is a kind of Japanese tradition, however, such heckling is not acceptable because he just spoke ill of her. In japan, man always has had a superiority to woman, so it is naturally hard to spread the idea of gender equality, however, we should try more to do it under the tide of globalization."
3124,I think so too. I think that Akihiro Suzuki should put an end to his job as a member of the Tokyo metropolitan assembly. I was surprised that Akihiro Suzuki did not say true things at first. lying is shameful thing as human. I think that both gender is equally and we shouldn't treat them differently.
3126,"I felt so sad when hear the news. 'Hurry up and get married' and 'Can't you have a baby?' ,the words by Akihiro Suzuki were the most rudeness words for women. I think that this incident display the fact that discrimination over sex has still existed in recent Japanese society. Moreover, he is a member of Abe's Liberal-Democratic Party that insists the necessity of comfortable society for women. I want the Diet reflect on the this accident and don't want to let the women down."
3127,"When I read this article, I don't think that discrimination to women in Japan has finished yet. Indeed, women's status has risen since war, but The custom of male predominance remains firmly. Akihiro Suzuki's remarks mean the discrimination. We should think this problem more seriously ."
3128,"I think Mr.Suzuki's heckling was awful. He should apologize to Ms.Shiomura. This disturbance shows Men and Women are not equal in Japan. Mr.Abe tries to boost the role of working women, but it is not enough. This problem has never been solved. I think the government should formulate concrete policies and take actions."
3131,"Recently gaining information by using internet is very convenient definitely. Of course there are many dangers, but if we learn the use of Internet, we can live together comfortably."
3133,"I was shocked at the circumstance of slave labour in shrimp industry in Thailand.Also, I don't know that these terrible situation still have existed. The slaves are as same as women like us, but their lives are so far from ours. I can't ignore the serious fact. However, ironically, there may be possible of our eating food which is produced by them. We are also the parties concerned. We should be aware of it and reconsider the solution."
3134,I'm so sad and angry with there still being customs of people treated as slaves. It is impermissible. We should behave to abolish this bad custom.
3137,"This theme of this article is protecting privacy vs free expression.These days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet, but we have to think by ourselves about whether it is true or not. Also we should be more aware of the fact that there is no security when we use the Internet. Especially,when we provide the Internet with information, especially that of privacy, we have to reconsider about dangerous and risky things which are caused."
3138,"When I read this article firstly, I got angry with Mr. Suzuki's heckle. At the same time I think that perhaps my trivial behavior hurt someone's heart, so I decided to care about my behavior."
3144,Histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions. So sometimes histories cause troubles. I understand both sides. We have no correct answer that one of them is wrong. We need more time to reach an agreement.
3145,"I want to agree with Mrs.Nakamura's opinion. We tend to forget the prejudice.Also, education can be the hotbed to do so for students.The knowledge which are taught in childhood is difficult to erase and change,so we should be more serious about the fact and it is always necessary to criticize whether our way of thinking is right or not."
3147,"When I read this article, I came to feel very deplorable.We should respect the sex without relations each other.We must not do something like this article.It is the topic that is in total sometimes taken up in Japan, but must think as a problem."
3148,"Possibly the utterance 'he should get married early' became no problem a decade ago. However, it is different now. It is natural that there is a section for sexual harassment in a company. The person in charge is troubled by the interval of a complaint and an excuse every day. i heard the fact from the visitor for my part-time job. Anyway, the utterance which wounds someone should avoid. When it is a parliamentary catcall, it is a quarrel between husband and wife, and it is after"
3149,"I don't think that heckle is good.But I don't support Shiomura's action. A part of heckles can be different from what she and media said.In addition, she spread over the world. I think it is unnecessary."
3154,"I think this news is very terrible. I always think I'd like to work in the future and also gain a happy family. However, hearing the news, I was seized by the fear that I couldn't work comfortably as planned in the Japanese society. It was very disappointed fact for me, and it made me rethink deeply about women in Japan. Japan is very advanced country in the wold, so I think people should feel it is ashamed not to treat women equal to men. We have to rapidly make true gender-equality society with referring to overseas, like Northern Europe."
3155,I agree with you.
3156,I agree with you.
3158,I agree with you.
3160,I thought that the textbook problem is difficult and histories have a lot of varieties . Each people have various opinions for them. But i think it is important that telling truth for next ages with textbook.
3163,"When I read this article, I seethed with anger at Mr. Suzuki. Women should be treated equivalent to the men. I hope it easier for women to work and raise children."
3164,I agree with your opinion that Akihiro Suzuki's heckles are disgraceful actions but throwing eggs at his office was not wise way. I think such protesting cause a chain of hatred.
3167,"When I read this article, I think that sleeping is very important, so I should sleep more. I haven't had enough sleeping time since I became a university student. But to make my life happier and more healthy, I must sleep more tonight."
3168,"I think so,too. Although they killed men, they have human rights.So we should respect their human rights. We should make a low which they can respect ones."
3169,"I agree with your opinion because the Internet is not only a good influence for us. It is good that a lot of information is got, but, on the other hand, it is a fact that there is a lot of unnecessary information. I think that it should prevent these information from adversely affecting youths."
3172,"When I read this article, I was surprised by it. WASHOKU is good taste and healthy. But sometimes it is not good taste for foreigners. So I was happy for WASHOKU to be recognized."
3173,"I think it is important to adopt new and more humane way of the penalty,but finally we should aim at the society which don't have any death penalty."
3174,"When I read this article, the ferry's captain is cruel man because he acted as murder. captain should be bold and kind, but he is a chicken.In this case, I think the behavior of the captain cannot be allowed, but I also think we all would have done in his way if we had been him."
3175,I think this remarks which Akihiro Suzuki said is disgraceful and he disappointed not only Ayaka Shimomura but people all over the world. He should be conscious of the thing that he is a member of the metropolitan assembly and watch his mouth. Other people who say the same remarks which Akihiro Suzuki did must apologize for her.
3177,"I think so too, because if there is no death penalty, terrible crime may increase. However, I think it isn't best execution. So, we need to reconsider the method of execution."
3180,"When I read this article, I was so sad and hope that the ferry's captain change himself. He must be punished and we should do many many things by the such thing happen next time. For example,we should restrict captains' license."
3181,"When I read this article, I was surprised. I think religion is free. English woman touched the taboo. we take it for granted, on the other hand some people think it taboo. we should respect difference."
3182,"I think the problem of textbook is popular.Textbooks reflect editor.So textbook can intently be distorted,but they should tell truth as possible as."
3184,This is a quite difficult problem. It cannot be discussed without correct information and opinions of various viewpoints. So we should study. And I think it necessary to educate young people not to repeat the same mistake.
3185,"When I read this story, I was shocked and we should not force others to apply our standard of religion. It is so sensitive and complex and difficult problem. so we have to rethink many thing like such problem."
3186,"I agree with him. actually, some Japanese labours are in same environment called black company. we should take action to protect human rights."
3187,I want the countries including Japan to keep good relationships because I love peace. Wars must not be happened again.
3188,When I read this article. I was so sad and we should not occur such thing. Death penalty must be banned quickly from all over the world. That is because it is not compensation.
3189,I don't agree with you. I think that death penalty is needed to all over the world.
3191,"When I read this article,I think This problem is very difficult and complex. I can understand each sides. I think each sides are correct."
3192,"we should treat people as slavery. in fact ,we Japanese eat shrimp alot.but not so many people don't know what happens while shrimp are made."
3193,"In this case, Mr. Suzuki is low moral, but Ayaka Shiomura is so ,too. Her twitter is example of this case. Recently, Mr.Nonomura is its example. I can't understand these fashion in Japan."
3194,"When I read this article, I think privacy's right should be protected. This is most important thing of all things. we should spread it more and more."
3195,"I think so too. War must not be brought about again. Not to make serious battle between nations, we also have to hand down the tragic story of the past to the next generation."
3197,"When I read this article, of course I was so sad.From this case, we can study a lot of things. For example,in this country,there is still sex discrimination. We should remove it from in this country."
3198,"When I read this news, I was very angry. As a woman , If I would be said like this, I would be very sad and hurt. In Japan so many women are eager to work. But they cannot work. So Japan government should make progress on this policy that women can work. In the future, I would like to work very much."
3199,"This news shows that the idea that man and woman are equal is not still spread. Mr,Abe should make effort to improve this situation.AS Shinomura says, Abe's key plank is not real, so he should think another key plank that is more like to come true than that. I think that it is good and important to improve the condition where women can work. for improving Japanese economy."
3201,"When I read this news, I think it is very rude. Mr.Suzuki's heckling was awful. He should apologize to Ms.Shiomura. Mr.Suzuki's remarks mean the discrimination. We should think this problem more seriously. We should try more to do it under the tide of globalization."
3206,"I think textbook problem is very difficult.Children don't have the ability to think critically.Therefore,teaching a partial world view in Japanese history means brainwashing.Education should be provided in neutral place."
3211,"I agree with you. I think we have little knowledge of drugs. So we should learn about drugs. If we do so, drugs won't be used carelessly."
3213,I agree with your opinion. Such action is too childish and is based on an inflexible thinking. Men who think that woman should do housework and bear children have to change the thinking.
3214,I agree with your opinion. Such action is too childish and is based on an inflexible thinking. Men who think that woman should do housework and bear children have to change the thinking.
3217,"I think that some informations will need for us if it is far from us. Although the information doesn't seem to be related to us, it might be very important for many people including you."
3219,"Religion and culture are so different ,difficult and complicated. Each country and region has peculiar them and people who come from other countries perhaps can't understand them. So,If you want to go abroad or other region you must study religion and culture local people have. Otherwise local people will possibly get angry with you and you will possibly be arrested. Even if you meant no harm ,there are cases that you harm other people unintentionally."
3221,"Death penalty may not be compensation and rights of criminals condemned to death may not be respected,but criminals did victims harm very much. Criminals robbed victims of rights-to-life and made many people sad. So I think Death penalty is needed."
3222,Internet is very useful to gain much information quickly. I use and need internet now and in the future. But sometimes internet exposes our privacy and hurt us. I think steps for internet is lack and technology advance.
3225,"I have a counterargument in your opinion. It approves of your opinion of the first half. I thought that this incident was shocking. However, I think that your idea of 'deciding a punishment by the person's crime' is not good. The weight of people's life is not compared. The weight of a punishment is not compared strictly, either. A punishment should not be changed with criminal importance, but a death penalty with medicine should be abolished. I assert abolition of capital punishment."
3234,"Developed countries including Japan have responsibility for this situation. They desire cheap cost ,so developing countries have no choice but to cut labour costs.I think developed countries must pay appropriate wages and make the circumstance that nobody is slave labour."
3235,"Education has two sides,virtue and vice.Depending on the its content and way it can be used for peace or war. So people who educate other people must think them and their happiness. All education which people who don't think it do are bad and wrong."
3236,"I agree with you.I like 'washoku' very much, so I am delighted for 'washoku' to become popular among foreigners. Now health-conscious people are increasing all over the world. I think that the demand for 'washoku' will increase more."
3242,"I was surprised that politician heckled other one who is women when I read this article, but i think this isn't' first time. These days, people are very sensitive to equality of the sexes. So, I think people, particularly who work in public, have to take care the equality carefully. And also I think politician should reconsider that they are elected. I felt that Akihiro Suzuki acted thoughtless. If he took that he was elected to heart, he wouldn't say such a thing. In short, what i want to say is politicians should reconsider those situation, and have to act as such."
3250,"I agree with your thought. When we buy cheaper goods we should never forget the existence of cheaper labors. In addition, we should have the awareness that it depends on our decisions whether cheaper labors conditions will be improved or not."
3257,"I think nobody likes a war. However wars occurred, is ongoing and will never perish. This is a political and also diplomatic issue. But we can avoid the war. That is why Mr.Prime minister is now trying to change the constitution. He would not like to start wars and repeat the tragedy such as the battle of Okinawa in WW2."
3286,"I strongly agree with you.You said that they should take measures to review their crisis management system as soon as possible.It is true that we should not forget this tragedy.However,all we have to do is make a new crisis management system in order not to occur such a tragedy repeatedly.They need a personnel cut.To do so,workers who was responsible for this accident should be punished and fired.Furthermore,we make them change an atmosphere in this company."
3287,"I strongly disagree with you.It is true that our privacy is important.However,we have to consider an important role of a freedom of expression as an ingredient of democracy.It is essential for democracy to be able to say what people want to do.Furthermore,we can guard our privacy by being careful about how to use the Internet to a certain degree.The law to regulate a freedom of speech in order to prevent a privacy invasion."
3293,"I agree with her comment. I think that Japan is behind the times in terms of sex equality. Actually Japan is 105th in rank of the country which has less gap of sex and is not good environment for women to work. On the other hand, other many countries, for example Iceland, Finland, Norway, and so on, were able to achieve to lessen the gap of sex, so women can appoint to an important post. We should be ashamed of the state of affairs and make efforts to improve it."
3294,"I partly disagree with his comment, because I don't think that Representative Suzuki should resign as a politician. I can understand his mind, but we should not be emotional. If he resign, the problem would be forgotten. It is a loss of chance of improvement of the gap of sex. I hope he continues to work as a politician, and whenever people look at him, they remember this matter."
3297,"These kind of jeering should not be accepted and allowed. However she should stop mentioning them. Because, He apologized and also Mr,Prime Minister explained the head of MINNANOTOU which Ms,Shiomura belongs to. Why didn't she stop grilling? Due to that, the metropolitan parliament needed to spare times for the jeering. I think Law makers should think about other issues."
3298,"I strongly agree with your comment. In old Japan, as you said,it is natural that men work and women do housework.But times have changed.In the world,there are now many working women whose achievements are great.Why we don't protect their environment in which they live and work?Also, this problem influences low birth rate.Developing an environment to enable women workers to continue in employment while caring for children or doing housework will be a big theme for Japan's future.Also, I want more and more wen to understand the difficulty of women's balance of works and housework, and help them."
3300,"I disagree with your comment. This theme of this article is protecting privacy vs free expression.It is true that ,as you said,we should be more careful about privacy.However,these days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet.Also, we have to consider about the right of the free expression.We should be more careful especially when we provide the Internet with the information.Now the age who use the Internet is younger and younger. I think the necessity of education of the media literacy will increase."
3301,I think stories of the people who underwent the WW2 are important and we have to respect them. However many people experienced the war so each of them has their memories about it. We should not focus on one story. We need to search a lot of stories and analyse them.
3303,We must explore the way of euthanasia for a death penalty. Condemned criminals are cruel but I think we do not need to let them feel pain when they die.
3307,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Even if we have something which we strongly want to express, it is wrong that we think we can or should do anything to express our opinions. We have to consider the way and when to express."
3308,"I disagree with your opinion a little. Indeed it is true that we have various opinions respectively and we must respect them, but the war is clearly bad thing and to hand down the tragic history to the coming age specifically is clearly good thing."
3312,"I disagree with your opinion. I think it is terrible that the government try to plant some radical ideas to students. However, I think it is important to deciding some contents which every students should learn by the government."
3319,I think so too.Personal information should not be leaked to the network society essentially.But in developed network society it is nearly impossible.So we should understand danger of network society to use the internet and nurture media literacy.
3321,"I sympathize with your opinion very much. Because this politician is the representative whom we nation chose, he must take a right action. Nevertheless, he heckled a woman. This action is an act to betray the nation. Therefore, I think that he should be criticized."
3322,"I am against a part of your opinion. It is true that we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. Of course, when we consider human rights, this is not necessarily a good thing. However, i think we have to have an efficient production method to sustain a population of 100 million. The too terrible labor circumstances should be prohibited, but a constant such work force may be necessary."
3326,"There are a lot of heckled even in debt in Japan. I think jeers should be excluded from the place of debate. We need only lo logic, not emotions With logic,they truly debate the matter and reach a constructive suggestion. And, yes it is true that women cannot enjoy enough opportunities of jobs, educations, social status...etc. Some Japanese said 'It is our custom that women support men or do not work and only do housework.'But it is not true. For example, in Kamakura period, girls who are children of samurai warriors can inherited feudal landed property from their parents. And Empress Suiko reigned over and governed Japan. She also send a letter of confirmation of independence. She has a strong authority.And housewives appear in rapid economic growth during the reign of Emperor Showa.It is only 40 years ago. Japanese should confirm the status of women."
3334,"I understand that American put a stress on the right of free speech. But it is for resisting against the government as one of the right of resistance. So they should budge from their opinion. American amendments is not necessarily the right under natural law. For instance, US constitution amendment 3 as follows, 'A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.' Of course it is not common conception of all the people in the world.people who is in different countries see it as a dangerous article and also see the devotion of the rights of life and safe of a lot of people as Rocke said. The matter of the rights of free speech is specific in America. They say they independent from Britain because of the King's oppression. Of course this story is a doubtful and controversial problem. But the dignities of individuals more important. And we should respect them."
3340,"I think labor like slavery should be prohibited in this 21st century. And I think Japan can take an important part of improvement of this situation. As a same Asian country, first we should buy a lot of goods like shrimps. It is seen as having the opposite effect. But without enough monetary base, the capitalism do not work perfectly and the cannot mend the working environment. Second, Japanese industries should advance to Thailand. Because Japanese company do not break rules about labor. The better working environment is with enough payment, holiday,social welfare service Thai. So they can export it to Thai. Japan and Thailand have a common about customs, Imperial(Royal) house, Buddhism strict manners. I think the relationship between Japan and Thai is the key to solve the problem."
3344,"I strongly disagree with your opinion. It is because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it were a murder. So I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment."
3346,"I strongly agree with you! Akihiro Suzuki did disgraceful thing as a human to Ayaka Shinzo. As a women, I was also socked at his saying. His action show today's male chauvinism society. We must rethink this society."
3366,"I disagree with you.Because you do not know that the content of today's textbooks of national history is also wrong. The standard of selecting information today is unclear. make matter worse, if we want to publish, we only have to find it is written in something without backing.And a lot of national historic societies are left wings. So they published textbooks as they want. And Abe try to change this situation, and protect children's rights of education."
3367,"I think so, too. Her demanding to the prime minister to apologize is not necessary. By doing so,and media focus on it, I fear that the matter of women is forgotten. We should think the status of women, not her performance."
3370,Ss
3371,I think so. Of course I cannot understand why the captain jumped into a rescue boat without helping passengers.He should have helped hundreds of people instead of himself.
3372,"I think so. Different countries have different cultures. Before you visit foreign county,you had better understand the culture of the county. It is so important that you understand other cultures."
3373,I agree with you. I think execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals is not good.
3374,I agree with you. this problem was so difficult. I think both the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for all people. However.it is the best thing to protect the privacy rights of the individual.
3375,"I agree with you, To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world!"
3376,I agree with you. some Japanese labours are in same environment called black company They are same as slavery labour.
3377,"I agree with you. He is the representative whom we nation chose,so This action is an act to betray the nation. We should remove such person from in this country."
3378,"I agree with you. People must adjust themself to their surroundings which internet makes now. In order to do that, we have to think the relationship with internet."
3381,This is true that the captain responsible to this accident. But a people should think seriously why this accident happened.
3382,"I think you should study a foreign country's culture before you visit this country. Then, you can avoid many troubles."
3383,I think death penalty should be abolished and I fear drug being used to punish criminals.I feel using drug to kill animals will lead to using drug to kill criminals some day.
3384,I think so too.
3385,I support Taketomi's decision because Taketomi choose right choice and resist nation's power for children.
3386,I agree with you.
3388,"When I read this news , I felt so sad because many people were killed by this tragedy . Also , I got angry with the captain of this ferry . It is crazy thing to escape from the ferry when the accident happened ."
3389,Every country has their own cultures. Every culture should be respected like When in Rome do as the Romans do.
3390,"I think the story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is so horrible and cruel . To be sure , he committed crime but he is one person and he has human rights . So this news shocked me ."
3391,I think death penalty should not be abolished but I think using drug to kill animals is bad thing too .
3392,"Wars killed many people so nobody want to do wars but wars often happen.Therefore , for not to do wars , we should educate children ."
3393,"We should keep and protect our rights of privacy . However , we also have rights of freedom to know . So it is complex problem . W e should try to find the best way ."
3394,I was so shocked from this news because I can not believe there are still people treated like slave . We should save them .
3395,"In developed country , women take part in society like men and do a lot of works . However , in Japan , women can not take part in society as men .Therefore , we should improve women's rights in society ."
3396,I agree with you and I can not understand why he can say such thing too .
3399,"It is true that by internet we can get information easily ,but we must not forget to protect privacy."
3400,"Using slave to make a profit is serious problem especially in poor countries. By helping these countries, we can tackle this problem."
3401,"In Japan, women don't have enough wright and protest against this problem is needed more.More and more people should concern this problem."
3410,"When I finished reading the article, I strongly sympathized with Aoki. I cannot stand to see gruesome depictions even in the fiction movies or dramas, so I was sure that I also might get big damage if I had been in her situation. I think people in the court should have consider psychological burdens as very sensitive and important matters, and understand deeply that their casual action would change other's life to bad one unexpectedly."
3411,"I am surprised as reading this story. Especially, Aoki Hifumi suffered from insomnia. I think a lay judge is to serious to perform for general people. No matter how trying the circumstance, she couldn't say that .She felt responsible for the job,so she endured that. I sympathize with her at the point. I think such a environment is problem. The Japanese are widely considered to have responsibility for jobs, and not to be able to say 'No' or 'I can't'. It is important that we must reconsider this system including mental treatment. In Japan, the system is just started, so we investigate other country that introduced in similar system of Japan.And If similar incident of mental damage like this article in other country, we should learn how they deal with that. This system has a big influence on life, so It is necessary for people to understand about this system. And professional judges need to work slowly and carefully with citizen judges."
3412,"I think that the lay judge system should be abolished. According to the Japanese Court, the purpose of the lay judge is to realize a society where people can have easy access to judicial services. But, there is no need to have easy access to judiciary. The lay judge is attack on the independence of the judiciary. Court decision is not making by consensus but by laws."
3413,"I support the judgment ruled by The Fukushima District Court. There are two reasons. First, I think there is nothing wrong with the hiring method of the lay judge system. As the article said, citizens can decline to be on juries. In short, lay judges involve the responsibility to fulfill their work. So even if you suffer from disorder as a result of serving on a jury, the lay judge system isn't to blame. Second, I also think serving on a jury doesn't constitute involuntary servitude. In regards to this, Hifumi Aoki think it is duty for citizens to serve on juries, but I think it is duty and right. And it made the judiciary be close not only to expert but to citizens. So I entirely think the lay judge system is constitutional. Due to the above reasons, I support the judgment."
3414,"I think the judgement is right. But, Fukushima district court had to announce strongly the possibility to see and hear gruesome evidence to citizen judges. It is right that Ms Aoki had right to refuse a demand to become a citizen judge and to participate gruesome murder trial. before the court ,if she heard that the citizen judges have to watch terrible photos, she had not be elected as a citizen judge. Also, she did not agonize the ASD. I cannot think only Ms Aoki has to take the responsibility for her ASD. I think also Fukushima district court which did not announce important thing is responsible for her ASD."
3415,"I disagree with lay judge system. That is certain there are various advantage s, for example, people can have interest for social problem, judgment is made by not only a judge but also ordinary citizen, and a term of trial can be shortened. But this article show us that working as a judge is harder than image. Anyone don't want to see grisly crime scene photos. Like Hifumi Aoki there are people who have mentally shock. Damages by trial are too much. It is bad a trial torture ordinary citizen. Therefore I oppose the system."
3416,"I support the lay judge system. It is because the system has good influence on our lives. It is possible for us to feel that judicial and social problem are more familiar. However, if we don't try to understand the system, problems such as this occur. Therefore, judges need to support citizens involved the trial carefully. If they can do it, the system will give a better effect on our lives. I think that ambiguous understanding of the lay judge system begets this problem. There are many things that must be improved about the system from now."
3417,"When I read this article, I surprised very much. I feel like understanding a feeling of Aoki. There is the person who cannot look at a horror film and the grotesque picture in one of the world. Even if it works to show such people a picture and a photograph by force, I think that there can be a serious thing. It may be difficult for the lay judge system to mind the psychology situation and the physical condition of such a citizen judge for the system that was still just introduced. We must think about a human being."
3418,"I was very surprised at the news.I think it is a pity.It is true that refusing to be a lay judge is difficult.However, the system will not hold if you approve an exception. Now I am studying The Constitution.Interpretations of constitutions often cause problem. All people have human rights, but they can be limited in some cases. There is interest in each person. So politics is difficult. I think the result of the trial isn't wrong. I want to study politics more."
3419,"When I read this article, I think her allegation is going too far. The judge system is need for judging fair by the view point of people and she couldn't assert the system is unconstitutionality easily. Also, it's incredible that she instituted a suit seeking redress. I think that she wouldn't understand the judge system properly and she is thoughtless. Certainly, the photo which used in the trial might be so grotesque and many people don't want to see. But since she was nominated for lay judge, she has a duty to be resolved see the various cruel materials and innervate the trial."
3420,"I think that the court's judgement was a bit too paternalistic. Certainly it may be one of the jury's duties to see some grotesque photos, but in the first place, we often overlook the fact that we have difficulty in refusing to be lay judges even if we have some valid reasons. And how about 'informed-consent'? Reading the news, we can find it doubtful that all juries are told enough beforehand that they may have to see something that may depress them. There is no denying that this two government-compelling aspects led to Ms.Aoki's mental disorder (as the article said, its causality was proved medically). Nevertheless, the court ruled against her, as if to say that she neglected 'to function as a citizen'. I wonder if it is really right. This news shows us the underlying disadvantages that a jury system has. Some changes should be made for the jury system, particularly for the process of selecting lay judges."
3421,"When I read this,I think what comes around goes around.Lay judge system was introduced to dissipate the dissociation of citizen and judiciary.I think this institution is functioning effectually.However it is sure that a new system created while at the same time new problem arise.The conflict with human being can't be helped.But judiciary does not make a judgment about this but should get something done."
3422,"I do not think it is right of the woman to start a lawsuit. Once we are chosen as a lay judge, we should prepare for something grisly because it is simply obvious that a criminal case has gruesome pictures or videos. Everyone in Japan know a lay judge system is carried out, so we have to prepare oneself mentally for a trial. Also, the side of a court should pay close attention to feelings of lay judges because they are not related to a criminal case in normal life. Japan needs to examine what the appropriate a lay judge system should be in the future."
3423,"When I read this article, I think that the Fukushima district court's refusal was right. Certainly I sympathize with Aoki, but we have the right that we can refuse serving as a lay judge. Serving as a lay judge means accepting seeing and hearing horrifying scenes. We should think this problem seriously. We must not forget that it involves a lot of risk and responsibility that you judge a person."
3424,"I thought lay judge system is good idea because they can consider with ordinary persons opinion in the court. But, after read this article I think it is not always so. Almost all people who chose for lay judge system are novices in trial. So, I think it is important that they have been considered about both psychological and spiritual damage as very sensitive matters."
3425,"I had not known this news, so I was surprised that the event a lay judge had brought suit happened in Japan. This problems is so difficult. I don't know which is correct and which is incorrect. I can understand Aoki's opinion well. I'm pretty sure it is fact that psychological burden on lay judges is heavy. Maybe, It is a big pain beyond my guess. However there is system of declining to be juries. Besides, I don't think lay judge system is fault and I think it is Indispensable in judiciary in Japan. Therefore, I think the court should keep trying to diminish burden on lay judges."
3426,"Indeed lay judge system is instructive for ordinary people,in other words beginners of law. Because it reflects the will of people in judgements. But I think the people not all but who want to participate in trials should take part in them. It's not good what leave scars on people's mind."
3427,"I think that we should have informed her of whether she will have to see grisly photos.However,it is important for lay judges to see photos in order to judge the case.If photos are not used,lay judges may misunderstand the importance of the case.Therefore, I think that we need to use grisly photos.However,the court should choose people as lay judges who are tolerant of grotesque photos.The government cannot impose hard work on us though we are not criminals.The constitution says that.She should have chosen as a lay judge."
3428,"I was surprised at the news because i haven't known the news before. I think that lay judge system should complete arrangement in order not to cause the happening. After choosing the lay judge person, we must first ascertain the wishes of the person concerned whether they can bear the grotesque things."
3429,"I think this problem isn't quite irrelevant to us because all of us may be designated to be a jury. Besides this, since I major in law, this news is very interesting for me. The court declined the application of the violation of Article 18 of the Constitution and concluded that to be a jury doesn't deserve a toil. I think this decision is not right and it is improper for us to see cruel pictures against our wills."
3430,"I thought lay judge system had an important role in a whole court system. However , after reading this story , I learned that it is not always true. I am examining lay judge system in another English class and I think that lay judge members had burden not only physically but also mentally because they can't read newspaper and watch TV and they can go nowhere during the court. I suppose not only Hifumi Aoki , many members are suffered from same reasons. That's why I think lay judge system should be changed for lay judge members and every citizens and the court."
3431,"Reading this article,I can't help sympathizing Ms.Aoki.Of course,it is true that judgement is true in terms of constitutional view,but in my opinion,the government should do away with it. In the first place,this system was introduced to reflect the citizen's view.But,in the wake of it,many people are interfered with their daily routine.In addition to that fact,there are a lot of concerns which says 'It is no use introducing citizen as a judge,cause they are amateur of law.' I myself agree to this notion. So, I presume this system should be abolished."
3432,I think lay judge system should be abolished.It is difficult for those who are selected to reject it.It give them burden.This case is article's case.So lay judge system should be abolished.
3433,i was surprised with this news. she was very very shocked.
3434,"When I read this news, I thought how difficult lay judge system is. Japan adopted lay judge system after USA and UK. At first, It seemed good system. The reason is the system made people who are not judges participate in the discussions about crime. However, in these days there are some problems like this article. Lay judges can be affected by physical and mental problems. Even if people who was chosen as lay judges can decline the role, no one can expect that mental and physical problem would cause the people by the trial. Thus lay judge system should be discussed more and more."
3435,"When I read this article, I was very surprised with what Mrs.Aoki. It is because what she said means that she deny the system of today's court. Although the stress which the material of the accident effects is not so little,I don't think she is in the right. Government allow people to deny attending court. So I think her logic will be recognized."
3436,"I think we should reform the system of lay judges, but should not abolish it. When we discuss this kind of matter,we should agree checking trials is our rights, but not duty. This notion is first imported from Europe when the Constitution of the Empire of Japan. According to the Article 59 'Trials and judgments of a Court shall be conducted publicly.' We have the similar Article today in the Constitution of Japan. So it is the right. I think people can decide whether join trials or not. So if people who cannot bear pressures and cruelties can refuse to serve. By changing the system as the above, a lot of people would refuse to serve lay judges. But it is okay. people who are familiar with law but not lawyer would be the majority. They know what is going on a trial and check it. Also a lot of them have legal minds. they are important when criminal trials. it is desirable that only citizens who can take part of trials and judges will sustain lay judges."
3437,"When I read this article, I think this kind of problems are very severe ones. This is because such problem is very related with emotional feelings and that depends on person to person, so I think it's very difficult to make rules toward this problem easily. Anyway, I believe that what is the most important thing is that all of us understand the bad situation and remind that we should try making efforts to solve this problem. We all could be the person like Hifumi Aoki and we are really related this problem."
3438,"When I read this article, I feel Aoki is poor. It's necessary to see an evidence in the court.This is because if they don't provide a true evidence, they won't judge a suspect. However it's also important to protect human rights of someone serving as a lay judge. So I suggest that a court should get a permission to see grisly photos from a person served as a lay judge and compensate them for the emotional burden."
3439,"When I read this article, I was very surprised and sympathized Aoki. The citizen judges will be chosen randomly from among qualified voters. She is the one, too. The qualified voter cannot decline a citizen judge without a special reason. According to this article, Aoki got sick because of the evidence photograph. Lay judge system is not surely bad. However, I think that the court should provide enough cares for her. I hope that a person like her does not appear again."
3440,It is difficult to avoid viewing grisly crime scene photos for lay judges to make a judgment. However courts should do something for them. Her lawyer said Aoki was not mentally prepared to see grisly photos. Therefore it is a big progress that lay judges will be informed ahead of the trial if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence to the court.
3441,"Reading this article aroused mixed feeling in me. I think Aoki has responsibility and a duty to see and hear evidence and has to face the crime which she committed. So, I was not able to sympathize with her at first. However, I think that human rights of any people should be protected. Although Aoki committed the murder, it is wrong that her human right should be infringed obstinately. I don't know her circumstances, so I can't sympathize with her, but I think that her insistence should be acknowledged more."
3442,"It is more trouble to many people than it is worth that songs are automatically downloaded even if they are free. I think that iTunes users gripe is quite natural because the record took up valuable iPhone storage space of them. I am troubled about that I don't have enough iPhone and PC storage space now, so if same thing happen to me, I won't feel good."
3443,"The incident is very impressive for me. When the U2's album was released for free on the internet , I was signed in iTunes. So the album was downloaded arbitrarily in my music application. As I didn't know that U2's album, I was very surprised the downloading and scared. I thought my account was taken over and some is impersonating my account user. My family became very anxious and searched how change the password of my account. Then we understood the downloading was done by Apple, so we felt relieved and got angry the download. I think it's good that U2 released the album for free, but I don't want to be downloaded arbitrarily even if the commercial are done."
3444,"When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because I had signed in iTunes two days ago. I checked my iTunes at once and knew that U2's album hadn't been downloaded on my iTunes. If U2's album had been downloaded on my iTunes, I would have been anxious about a computer virus. And also I would have been unpleasant because my valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in. I couldn't forgive Apple and U2 if this accident had been scheme in collaboration."
3445,"I support lay judge system. Because, it can live man-like to participate in politics. But, there are many problem, it likes this article. Some people feel burden this system. So I propose Installation of a mental supporters for them. It can reduce their mental burden, I think."
3446,"I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes. But I do not think this causes such a big problem in the world. In the way, I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Because If apple had already make choices weather iTunes customer get U2's album for free or not, many iTunes customers have not been complained.In fact, U2 is the known and popular rock band. Nonetheway, there are many people who have not been interested in U2. For me, I had not known U2 until I read this article. Therefore, apple had to consider various people's needs."
3447,"I sympathize with the woman. If I had to see the photos which display grisly scenes, I would feel sick. I heard that my friend's sister, who studies law at college, also have seen such photos in the criminal law's class. Although she had heard that photos of grisly scenes will be projected from the teacher in advance, in that class, she got dizzy and could not take the class till last. The woman in this case did not know that the photos were projected so the shock she got would be immeasurable."
3448,"I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. I do not use iTunes because I don't have iPods nor iPhones. Thus I do not know the system of iTunes in detail, but I knew that, to add musics of iTunes to Podcasts, we must pay for them. However, in this case, the album was distributed for free. Moreover, there are people who were troubled by it. I think both the artist and Apple should take responsibility for them."
3449,"I think automatic freebie is a good idea. Some people like U2's songs taking advantage of delivery. However, this system got a lot of criticism because their album took up valuable iPhone storage space. Some iTunes users certainly were irritated by this. The fact that Bono meant no harm is an important point. If Apple had not made such a system, U2 would not have lost their popularity. I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized."
3450,"I support lay judge system from the viewpoint of citizen can participate in the judicature, but it damage lay judge for example when they are shown grisly evidence in murder trials. I think Ms.Aoki was very shocked when she saw grisly photos, and if I were her, also I were shocked at them and suffered from insomnia. It is important for trials to check evidence, but a court should inform ahead of the trial if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence and give alternatives that lay judge can refuse such grisly evidence."
3451,"When I read this article, to tell the truth, I couldn't understand what's happen. Now I think Bono gave away U2's latest album for free on iTunes account without malice, because he wanted iTunes users to listen their new songs, but users were sure to wonder why there was the album on their iTunes account although they didn't download it. Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not."
3452,"When I read this article, I thought that an act of Bono was good at the first. This is because we can obtain the latest album of the artist for free. However, I feel that this thought was wrong now. I usually use the android cellphone. So, because I do not use iTunes and structure of iTunes. In this case, U2'album took up valuable iPhone storage space. In the world, there are a lot of people who do not know U2. It is very annoying that the album of the artist which we are not interested in uses the storage space. I think that Apple and an artist should not cause such an event from now on."
3453,"I think that U2 doesn't need to apologize. This method is a clear advertising strategy. I don't use the iTunes, so I don't know iTunes's system well enough. But, this case cause slight damage to iTunes user's maybe. If you dislike this music, you only have to delete from iTunes. Consequently, it may be said that U2 achieved a strategic victory. U2 made news with their performance, and then U2 is known by me."
3454,"In my case, I don't know U2. So I think this is chance to know the group for free. But thinking from consumers who don't have a interest, it is worth grumbling. If they can choice whether doing download or not, they didn't claim. It is problem the album was download automatically. And people want to erase the album, they have to erase by themselves. Bono apologized to people, but they grumble about the automatically download system and the way of erase the songs.So I think to need to apologize is not so much Bono but Apple."
3455,"I think this incident is not all that serious.As they hand out free samples on the street,giving out freebie songs deserve to go down. Recently,people only listen to the music which others are listening to,is famous and popular.In other words,they don't find new music on their own which they really approve.So,freebies of music give us the chances that we can encounter new songs.I think it is a breakthrough idea. But,what couldn't delete the songs was bad if person was not to his liking.After all an unsuitable sample is just like yesterday's garbage."
3456,"U2's album downloaded automatically is good strategy for Apple to get to know more people about Apple. Therefore, I think it is not necessary for Apple to apologize. However, I was surprised at this incident when I knew it. I had misgivings about a risk of an outflow of personal information. Therefore, the true that U2's album took up valuable iPhone storage space worried me furthermore. I think it is important to provide an opportunity of the discussion between Apple and us. More detail explanation is necessary for us to understand it."
3457,"I think that you must not have an influence on the domain of another person even if it is free. The world becomes convenient by the development of the information technology steadily, but there should be the line which we cannot exceed. It may be good for a method of the advertising, but must not force it on people. Say in Japanese; ARIGATAMEIWAKU. However, we take time to know the real intention of this event."
3458,"I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. First, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well. Because their latest album was given away on more than half billion iTunes accounts including mine. Probably lots of people who didn't known them listened to their songs. Next I mention a bad side of it. I think there were two problems in it. First problem is that their latest album was automatically downloaded. As a result of it, some iTunes users griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. Second problem is that Apple made it impossible for people to remove the album from their iTunes accounts. Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."
3459,"I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. First, I mention a good side of it.

Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."
3460,"To give iPhone's users U2's album for free may makes them worry that they bought this album by mistake.To tell the truth,I experienced that.I am a iPhone's user.I did not think it was a problem.However,Apple should let them decide to get this album.The titles of music in your iphone show your personality.Adding this album to your list without permission is too rude.I think Apple should take the blame for this untoward event."
3461,"I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action. At first, I mention a good side of it. From the view point of U2's promotion, it can be said that they put over the beautiful idea very well.Because their latest album was given away on more than half billion iTunes accounts including mine.Probably lots of people who didn't know them listened to their songs.

Second problem is that Apple made it impossible for people to remove it from their iTunes accounts.Thereby, trifling complaints came into the open, I think. In this way, I consider there is also a good side and bad side in U2 and Apple's action."
3462,"When I read this article, I remembered that U2's new album automatically had been downloaded onto my iTunes. It was not I read this until I knew the reason and the details. I can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. However, whether we will listen the song is depend on our right of choice. If we had could choose whether we download or not, everybody's grumbles wouldn't have spread."
3463,"When I heard this news, I was very shocking. This is because I have not heard such this problem. If you admit such a thing only in a specific group,other groups hope the same thing and may cause confusion. In addition, they find the profit only for themselves and it is big failure to have brought big uneasiness to too people of the world. It will go without saying that an irreparable thing happens if not conscious of only this so that each people do not cause a problem in now when a network develops. I think that it is the serious news that people of the world realized it."
3464,"Action of Bono is bad. There are two reasons . First,action of Bono is selfish . Everyone does not necessarily like this music. Actually,the criticism from many persons came. Second, it is impolite in other bands. Music is things to trade. Therefore, distributing for nothing is self-centered. In conclusion, a deed of Bono has an image of minus."
3465,"When I read this news I was surprised.I often use iTunes,and I buy music. Music people like around the world different from not only country to county ,but person to person.The sudden the automatic download of U2s may album upset people terribly except for U2's fans. After reading this article, a friend of mine also one of this confusion,she was very surprised at the emergence of the album, If I do so, I will get scary and may not have good feeling.About his affair, apple should not do so automatically,I think. Apple did something unnecessary. Although for U2, they think it is good chance to listen their music around the world, its reputations were not always good thing about this Apple's method. As a result, it may not be expected for them."
3466,"I approve of the result of this trial. And an improvement of a juror system is expected. First,since a jury system is a national duty, it is not a slavish restraint. Next, even if it expects seeing a grotesque picture of evidence, the person himself/herself can not know whether they are contents which he/she can bear. It is clear that the explanation on the administration-of-justice side until now was insufficient. That is, although judgment of a trial is right, there is room to improve a juror system."
3467,"When I read this article, I was very surprised because I didn't know this news. I didn't update my iPhone, so this album didn't downloaded to my iPhone automatically. But I think this idea is not so bad. it's because it charge no cost and we can listen to new album. Although it took up valuable iPhone storage space, but it is good to listen to a lot of people all over the world. I think If I am singer, I would do that maybe. but this is not good thing to iPhone users. Apple and Bono should apologized to users."
3468,"Before I read this article, I didn't know the news about U2 album. Therefore, I really surprised to know that this kind of thing happened. At first, it seemed that iTunes users felt happy because they actually got the U2's latest album for free!! However, according to this article, many users would have trouble that their valuable iPhone storage was taken up. I don't use iTunes so I don't have enough knowledge about the usage exactly. However if I were in their place, I would be angry like them because such thing, that U2 album was downloaded automatically, was not following my own will. Considering what I wrote, the Bono's behavior was totally bad thing, but I think I can understand the feeling of artists and some burdens, such as pressure. Anyway, this kind of thing should not happen so we should try to make rules to escape such situation and not to permit this kind of actions."
3469,"I think lay judge system has a lot of problems. In such this case, the system had no consideration for lay judge. Even if the gruesome photos, movies and voices are very important evidence, the lay judge does not want to see them so it need not to see because it will be possible to bear the emotional burden. In other case, if you are selected for lay judge, you cannot refuse, so it will get behind in your life. Lay judge system was introduced because it would raise citizens' concern about the judiciary. Certainly, since then, I had never had concern about it, however, I have been interested in it now. I think lay judge system leaves much room for improvement."
3470,"It's terrible. U2's members would be shocked very much. I'm sorry for him. However if I can download a song for free, I will be happy. It's difficult problem."
3471,I think we can't blame the members of U2 for giving away U2's latest album for free on iTunes accounts. Because they did that in order to not only for themselves but also for the iTunes accounts. I think they should had given away their latest album for accounts who wanted to listen their songs.
3472,"I was surprised at this news for inconsiderable of the court to general people. Though the court needs gruesome clues,they must care the general people who served as a lay judge."
3473,"I understand the feelings Bono wanted a lot of people to hear his music, however, it's illegal to make iTunes accounts downloaded his music automatically.This is because we have human rights to listen to music we want to.But I think it's not bad to make his music free. Moreover I was surprised that he could make his music download our iTunes willfully.I felt scare as I don't know what I am going to be done online."
3474,"This problem was caused by U2's thoughtless action. It may be a good attitude for its members to try to make their songs heard all over the world. However, they neglected to take iPhone users' privacy into consideration. They overlooked the fact that the Internet had become another reality, where personal spaces do exist and respected to some extent. For example, If the band were on streets or at some other public places in London as a promotion and distributed its new album to passengers as a freebie, they might not be angry so much and there might be no serious problem. But if it intruded on people's home at random and thrust the album to them, they would feel 'violated' by the sudden visits and might complain about that. U2 just did the latter in the cyber world and at a much larger scale. So, in conclusion, privacy should be protected even in the Internet world."
3475,"When I finished reading this article, I was surprised at this incident. I don't use iTunes, but if I used iTunes, I would be disgusted. I think that iTunes should take responsibility for this trouble rather than Bono. Because If iTunes's security had been stronger, this trouble would have happened."
3476,"I was very surprised at this news. I don't agree with the action. However, some people whose devices' capacity of memory are low may complain. If the album had been automatically downloaded, users should have been able to remove it. Artists should be proud of their songs."
3477,"It is very difficult to answer this problem. It is sure that the lay judge system contains gruesome evidences, for example we might have to see some things we don't expect. However, I think the lay judge system is necessary for us, because it can see things objectively. So, I think the lay judge system should improve."
3478,"I was very interested this article. At first , almost of us may feel sorry for U2. Many people could get the group's new album for free. Dud to it, their sales will decrease seemingly.However, we can see this problem from different point. Although their album was released free in iTunes, we can see some good point for U2 in this article. This is known globally due to the itself bigness and we can think it is good advertisement for U2. Their new album is known by many people and it will be good business."
3479,"I am surprised that U2's new album is downloaded arbitrarily.I don't have iPod,iPhone and so on.So when I knew the news ,I am surprised."
3480,"I disagree with lay judge system. Indeed there are a lot of advantages of this system, for example, people who aren't familiar with law or criminal can take part in trials. This experience would give them interests for the judicial world. However, there are a lot of disadvantages. I think this article shows this negative phase vividly. Mr. Aoki didn't want to watch such grotesque photos. But he had to watch them against his will because he was a lay judge. I wonder this coercive participation deny his fundamental right. Just because it is the citizen's duty to take part in trials as a lay judge, it doesn't follow that the government can force us to watch all evidences. I'm for the Fukushima District Court judge, but I think the lay judge system should be abolished."
3481,"This is the news of rock musicians who gave their latest album for free.In the wake of it,that incident arouse a some kind of problem. In short ,suffice it to say that rock band group U2,especially Bono misunderstood what the consumers pleased with. Also It is true that a handful of i phone users might presume that 'What an elaborated and nice present this is!' .But other i phone users specially who are not interested in U2 must have thought it was infringement of their valuable asset,that is ,limited capacity.Their merits are not incongruous with each other. May be Bono has chimera that their songs might please everybody.So,as a trade-off strategy Bono should have introduced selection system.in other words,those who want to listen to their music only can download them for free."
3482,"I was surprised when I saw this article on the Internet. There are many people who blame Bono. However, I think that they must not blame Bono. Bono gave away U2's latest album for free, because he thought that many people will be happy about giving away the album for free. He want many people to be happy. So, we must not blame Bono."
3483,"When I read the article, I thought giving away U2's latest album for free was not bad thing. Certainly, some people feel uncomfortable when the new album was automatically downloaded onto iTunes because of their tastes, and other may misunderstand they downloaded unknown artist's music by mistake. However, almost users wouldn't care about new music's and I think the new album does no harm, because if someone don't like them, they should delete new album. Bono had no malice, so they don't have to be blamed so much."
3484,"This news interested me so much. I didn't know this article. At first, I thought this attempt would make all people, whether they are fans or not. Because of freebie, they need not pay any money. They can listen to their songs at free. However, I was to consider this attempt is no favor at all. Some fans might be happy, but those who are not interested in this artist must be unhappy. Because they don't need these songs and may not hear forever. More consideration might have needed for Bono."
3486,"I think U2 didn't do bad thing because it is freebie and they can remove the album from their iTunes account. It isn't good to take up valuable storage space certainly, but people who like U2's music will be glad. Not only U2 but also Apple should apologize to iTunes user for their own careless system."
3488,"When I heard about this news for the first time, I was disgusted at it. I have often heard news about politics and money problem recently. I think it is not good that government stops by politicians' problems which shouldn't be took up in the Diet primarily. I was disgusted to see that members of the Diet quarrel about that a round bill is a fan or not. Mr Abe declare the slogan, 'the society women can play an active part in.' Therefore he adopted no less than five female Cabinet ministers. However two ministers were forced into positions in which they must resign. It is sure that Mr Abe and the cabinet are in a difficult time."
3489,"I was very surprised that such misconduct has occurred that some days aren't passed when the Minister of Economy changed. Ms. Obuchi resigned by being suspended that she has a funding scandal. When government elect the next Minister, I wonder why Abe Prime Minister didn't research the people who properly became a candidate. In the process of researching, government must find that the local secretary of Miyazawa had put out the unnecessary political activity costs. I thought it was really not have been made firmly ."
3490,"The responsibility of the politician in this incident is large. I was disappointed about the politician having used money for self-interest. A politician tends to leave a report to a secretary. However, even if it does not know injustice, the politician has to take the responsibility. That is, the politician should worry about a subordinate's deed. Their resignation became a cause by which the approval rating for the prime minister fell. The politician should become prudent to use people's tax."
3492,I was surprised at this news because the top politicians have less responsibility and abuse their expense. They were blinded by self-interest. Their work is not for themselves but for people. I think the politicians must remember the spirit that they started with and pride themselves for their work.
3493,"Recently, scandal by politician occur frequently. I was offended when I watched they apologized for their mistake formality. And I was surprised at Mr Miyazawa's state that he himself did not go there at all. It shows he doesn't have no responsibility for members of his political group. I want not to watch such politician anymore. It's incredible to use tax from citizen. Management of money should be strict and voter need choose candidates more carefully."
3494,"Whenever I hear a funding scandal of politicians, I lose a trust of politicians. I wish them to have more responsibility of their behaviors. The most thing I was surprised is a scandal that women were involved. One of prime minister Abe's goal is social advancement of women. However, the scandal like Ms. Obuchi's will become a reason to prevent from social advancement of women. Many politicians' relatives also are politicians. I think it is not good for modern politics. It is because that their relatives tell their opinions. It is of course not to change to better direction. I hope that such incident never happen again."
3497,"I was so disappointed!!! This is my first impression when I heard about this news. Maybe many Japanese people have had enough of this kind of news, Japanese politicians' financial problems before. In this case, I was very surprised because this scandal about Yoichi Miyazawa came to light as soon as he was appointed the new economy, trade and industry minister. I really want them to have more responsibility towards their actions because they work as a leader of Japan. As for changing Japanese Prime Minister quickly, it's not good for Japan's impression from other countries. Moreover, I was very shocked about the news that Ms.Obuchi and Ms.Matsushima resigned because of financial problems. As this article says, this kind of thing prevents Mr Abe's goal of having more female representation in the upper echelons of government, and I really hope his goal will come true as a woman. Therefore, I think we should reconsider how the politicians behave and the system that have many family members. I think it should be changed to make them act correctly by their heart as a member of Japanese citizens, not by their family members' voice."
3498,"I was shocked at two points of the article. First, representations of general people were occurred many bad problems. Although I think they are smart, I wonder why they behave dishonestly . Not to tell a lie and to follow rules are so simple and easy rule to understand and obey. Second , this cases were caused by two women of ministers. Mr Abe proceeds the plan having more female representations in the upper echelons of government. But, the problems such as this article made bad. Impression about the plan or females. I think the plan refer to a fundamental problem about sexism. And the plan is unnatural way.So I hope the world become gender neutral without unnatural support from a country."
3500,"When I read this article, I was surprised very much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In the situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the sadomasochistic bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms.Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more."
3501,"In these days, I hear much news that politicians' use taxes in wrong ways. This case is also one of those news. Mr.Miyazawa said he did not go to the club but I think the most important point is not in whether he went there, but in the money used was paid by citizens. However, it is true that there are many cases like this. I think there are much more that we unaware of. I want him to regret that he should be more careful to his staffs' behavior, but, on the other hand, I cannot help but sympathize with him."
3502,I agree with you. I think lay judge system should not be introduced in forced way. It is true that there are many positive points so I don't think it to be abolished but people who don't want to be lay judge should quit of that.
3503,"I think the same way as you. I don't use iTunes so I know little about that, but the storage is so important for us. In addition, if you use them to your daily works, it's more important to you. I want that the same thing never happen."
3504,"I think so, too. He should apologize not for his behavior but for his carelessness. We will have right to vote soon so we should choose candidate carefully."
3505,"When I heard this news, I was disappointed because this news was the same thing until now. After Mr.Abe became the prime minister,I thought to be reliable because there is no scandal, we were so surprised and it was a shock. However, I think that I want them to do their best that it is hopeless one to have got up and no longer loses the trust of the nation. I think that I want them to change conventional bad politics little by little from now on."
3506,"I don't think that this news is so disappointing. It's nothing new. In our long, long political history, we have learned that politicians in Japan sometimes spend much money from their funds as 'political activities' which seem unreasonable or ridiculous in common sense (for example, grand banquets in typical exclusive Japanese restaurants or expensive hot spring resorts, in order to hope for something like funding or cooperating in return) and realized that these activities are sometimes necessary. And this expense on a sex club is, though it might be a bit too dirty, surely a one of such activities. So, what is the matter? Since our nation's great and high-minded politicians have already eaten up our precious taxes more or less, is there any use in criticizing the expense alone? Rather, let's praise it for 'having spent only 18,230 yen' and 'not having wasted our taxes so much as in other political activities' ! We citizens should not narrow our visions. In this case, we and mass media should have not focus on the word,'expense on a sex club' too much. The Diet has been in danger of losing its solid foundation. If we complain about trifles, it will surely delay its economical actions or diplomatic policies which are far more important than trivial, non-illegal scandals."
3510,I agree with your comment. This deplorable scandal had a big influence all over Japan. It is a big blow that two female ministers resigned at once for Abe's cabinet.
3511,"When I signed iTunes without knowing the download, I wasn't aware of the downloading. So I was very surprised the news as you. I want to have Apple never do such action."
3512,"I agree with your opinion. Though the lay judge system is very important for our society, the system might have a serious burden for people. So the government need to do such exam when they were elected as lay judge. Also people had better make up their mind to deal with such grotesque materials."
3516,"I think that this news is a problem about intellectual property rights. Apple must not made such a system. Because, artists don't enough to be protect. If iTunes's security is stronger, this trouble didn't happen. I think Apple should apologize to iTunes user and U2."
3521,"I agree with you. Judging with gruesome clues is hard work, so they should be considered. This system has room for further improvement."
3522,"I think what U2 did was not so bad because it was a chance that would make people who have never known about U2 realize a new fantastic artist. When you find that U2's new album is automatically downloaded for free, you will be confused at first. First of all, you should try to listen to the album. If you have really taken to them, this action of U2 is good, on the other hand, if you have no interest in them, you can delete them. This is a strategy. I think this is good for you to know a new fantastic artist for free."
3525,"I watched the CM of U2′s new album for free on iTunes on TV, so I was not so surprised at this news, but in my first time watching the CM, I was so surprised because U2 is world famous rock group. I think that that is not so bad thing because if I did not know U2 at that time, I tried to listen to the album for free."
3539,"I also think this automatic freebie is not so bad. Bono got a chance of making widely known, and of course he made good use of it. This is a natural thing, so we should not blame him."
3540,"It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal. Such an uproar is repeated and the confidence of Japanese government is undermined. The scandal of minister has no relation to prime minister directly, but Japanese people have a bad impression. I hope Japanese government will have strong support from the public."
3542,I think that the Obuchi′s scandal is the most serious problem because she could not understand how much money she used and the political fund is not hers. She must know her spending a lot of money and we must not choose a person who cannot control his or her money. Ms Matsushima shouldn't quit her job because of trifling thing as Uchiwa.
3543,"I in part agree with you. We know that the jury system is necessary in today's society in a way, yet there are much more problems than we imagine. This case is just one of them. Though I do not say that the system has to be abolished, I think all Japanese should think over the pros and cons about it."
3544,"Your opinion is good, though I think i in part disagree with it. As you say, It may be true that the freebie action which they did functioned as expanding our music experience. Yet I insist that it was much different from campaigns that are done on the street. They violated 'personal areas' that surely exist in the Internet. It is like in real life they invade your home and thrust the album independently of your will. In this point, I think what they did was quite serious."
3546,"I disagree with lay judge system.It is difficult for those who are selected to reject it. I think lay judge system should not be introduced in forced way. We know that the jury system is very necessary nowadays, but there are a lot of problems. This case is just small piece of them. However I don't think that the system has to be abolished, I wish all Japanese should think about it."
3547,"When I read this article, I though there are a lot of scandals by politician recently and I was very disappointed for Japanese political office. It is absolutely prohibit things to use tax for private use. The article says, Mr Miyazawa didn't go to club and his member went to. But I am skeptical about it. I strongly believe if people investigate more, a lot of scandals will revealed. I wish no scandals anymore."
3548,"After I read this article, I checked my iPhone's music application. There are several U2's songs. I didn't realize it before I read this, so I was very surprised. The problem of this article is security quality of Apple. I think the trouble in this article is important but isn't so much dangerous, because it is only downloaded automatically by Apple. However, we can assert that Apple's security system is careless. If Apple flow out personal information, it would be more important and dangerous problem than this article's one. So Apple should improve its security system."
3549,"In Japanese politics, these problems what related to politicians and money often happened. Politicians are representations of citizens. So they should behave as such. However, they don't. I can't understand why politicians can not obey the law. It is sure that we citizens are also responsibility for election, but I think politicians are lacking in sense of responsibility. So, citizens should elect statesman carefully and people who want to be involved in politics should have more responsibility."
3550,This is disappointing news. Trade minister Yoichi Miyazawa claims that he did not go to sadomasochistic bar though this claim is irrational. His point detracts from the real issue. Politicians must spend a political fund for the national interest .It is democratic destruction to collect votes by spending a political fund. Therefore I can't permit not only Miyazawa but the scandal of Ms Obuchi too. She was involved in payoff scandal. I think she destroyed the faith to the democracy.
3552,"I didn't know the CM. If I can listen the music that I have never known for free, I am very glad. I also think that is not so bad thing."
3553,"I believe it is wrong for only U2 to be criticized, too. However, I don't think automatic freebie is a good idea. In fact, this system may take up valuable iPhone storage space. Because I use Android Phone, I do not know the iPhone in detail. But, according to what I heard, this seems to be an annoying thing. That's why I am against your opinion."
3554,"I sympathize with your opinion. Recently, politician causes a problem too much. This is annoying thing for us. Especially, there are a great many problems about the tax. I feel that a politician despises the nation. The politician should take responsibility even if a politician is not related to a problem directly."
3555,I agree with you. The money paid by citizen should be used more carefully. We wouldn't be aware of other case. Politicians should feel a sense of guilt.
3558,"The scandal of the Japanese politician is one of the news to hear well.However, the nation will have distrust for politics of Japan whenever we hear the news.The cabinet aiming at the social advance of the woman must be upset now, too. This is because a woman politician becomes a target of the scandal.I think that future correspondence is very important.I want you to try to never have such a thing."
3564,"Your opinion is so good! The thought did not hit to me.U2 surely succeeded as an advertisement strategy.Judging from such a viewpoint, there is not the reason to apologize for."
3566,"Recently, many people more focus on what a politician did in their private than what they will do in future. I think this tendency is not good. In this case , many people blame Miyazawa's secretary going to sexual club to have a talk with someone. In my opinion , we blame this opinion too much. I can't tell going to such a club to have a political chat from going to a bar to have a political chat. We have to realize that there is something more important than that."
3568,"When I heard this news, I worried about her immediately. In the first place, I am against this system. The accident may burden like woman and it does not think that it is possible in the fair judges because they do not know the law. However, I think that the country should support the maximum since there is such a system. I think the support for her is not enough. About this system, I think that it is necessary to reconsider it more so that such a person never appears."
3569,"I was surprised when I read your comment because you wrote that you had signed in iTunes and actually you had gotten the U2's album!!! I don't use the iTunes so don't know well about it, but I understood how you were surprised when that happened. Anyway, I agree with you in that it's not good to be downloaded automatically."
3570,"I agree with you in that the politician should have take the responsibility. As you wrote, they use the tax Japanese citizens paid, so they have to be more careful and become prudent to use it. I really hope they will never do that, and don't want to hear about such politicians' financial news any more."
3578,"I sympathize with your comment. I think that not only Bono but also Apple apologize to people who are iTunes users. Apple should prepare the way people can select whether the album download or not . So following the way, people who get angry about taking valuable space of download and the way the album erase themselves don't angry like that."
3579,"I agree with the lay judge system. Because, the system is going well. This kind of case could be expected! It is not appropriate to criticise emotionally when some problems happen. Of course, the court is responsible for this accident. The lay judge is a great system but we must manage carefully."
3580,"I was so disgusted about Mr.Miyazawa because his support group spent office money at a sadomasochistic bar, which is a questionable place. Also I disappointed with Ms.Obuchi and Ms.Matsushima's resignation because I was looking for women legislators to take a lively part in the government. If they hadn't been concerned with their problems directly, they should have understood what their support group did and stopped their wrong doing."
3581,"I agree with your two opinions. This is because it was able to understand a thought not only it troubled not only many general people, but also other singers and bands. When people of the world become egocentric, you may imagine easily that we will confuse.In addition to their action having confused people, you must not forget to have had possibilities to be a chance to do the thought that other people are egocentric either. That's why, their action was so bad as you say."
3582,I agree with your opinion. Government should research about candidates and their local secretary before electing the next minister.
3583,I agree with your opinion. Apple also should apologize for consumers and give choice whether they download latest U2's album or not.
3584,"I agree with your opinion. I also think the lay judge system has good influence on our participation in the judicature, but judges have to support citizens in the trial carefully."
3585,"I think that the different opinion of your viewpoint is great. The action of the politician is not good, but I think their private is not protected. They must take action like politician, but I think that the life as the commoner should be promised. I think that we have to criticize the action of media."
3586,"I agree with your opinion. It is hard for me to watch a fiction movie and a drama.Therefore I can understand what you are saying and the burden on her. Thus,I hate this role. So the government understands the pains of people whom the life may turn into and I think that it is necessary to take measures."
3587,"These days I can not keep up with the improvement in technology. However I think that people giving receiver something that receiver does not want is so rude. Soliciting papers, cult, coercive selling etc... should we notice ' No Hawkers or Salesmen' online? The Internets are full of ads! I can not stand it."
3588,"When I heard this news, I was disappointed so much. In these days, there are a lot of scandals related politicians. Ms. Obuchi and Ms.Matsushima resigned a few days ago. The reason why Ms.Obuchi resigned was she used money ,which was political funds, for private. In addition to that, she said that she did not understand anything because her secretary took charge of all her money. Politics in Japan is in critical situation, I think. It should be changed as soon as possible."
3589,I agree with you. I think the lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Because social problems are more familiar to us. But serious problems like this would occur if citizens don't have enough understanding about lay judge system.
3590,"I agree with this opinion. When I heard this news firstly, I was surprised. However as this opinion said, I could not think this problem is familiar to me because I also don't have iPod, iphone and iPad."
3591,I agree with this opinion. I also think that Ms.Obuchi could not understand how much money she used and her secretary took charge of her all money. Such a person should not be elected.
3598,"I wonder why there are new songs on my iTunes list though I did not download any music on iTunes. After read this article I could solve this problem. The songs automatically downloaded is lucky for someone, but it might be trouble for many people. In my situation, there is enough storage in my computer, so this songs is not big influence for me. But if there is little storage in computer it is big problem for the computer user. I think this artist did this action for good faith. But we must consider other people before do any actions."
3600,I understand your stance a lot. The valuable shortage of iTunes could decrease by album which I am not interested in are so bad. Apple and U2 should apologize.
3601,I agree with you. Recently Japanese politics are lacking in sense of responsibility. We should watch carefully how their money moved and make statements.
3603,"When I know this article, I got angry with Japan minister who support staff spent office money at a sex club.This is because they spent unjustified expenses with taxpayer's money. Recently there are some scandal in Abe's cabinet.So my distrust of Abe's cabinet has been increasing since it happened. Moreover I think it is not enough that politicians take part in the government sincerely."
3606,"I agree with you. Having interest for social problem doesn't serve as a justification for getting a shock. And, I think people don't need to entertain an interest in judicial services. We should leave it up to professional's judgment. It is necessary to preserve independence of the judiciary."
3607,"I think your criticism is inaccurate and moreover misses the point. This delivery service is caused by U2. So, U2's property rights are not violated. This is U2's advertising strategy. I think it is interesting departure in advertising strategy. Of course, U2 doesn't need to apologize."
3608,"When I read this article, I was so shocked. I had known resignation of two women ministers, but I had never thought that the successor, Mr.Miyazawa already had occurred scandal. Recently politicians often cause many scandals. Every time I hear such a news, I feel sad. They should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us. I hope that they will not disappoint us any more."
3609,"I agree with you. Presence of the second-generation politicians means that preventing political reform. So, we should spot exceptionally capable politicians. I hope to get executed women's full participation in society."
3616,"One could argue that a funding scandal of politicians is shameful and Japanese politicians need to be held accountable for chosen delegate. However,it won't get you anywhere to say something.Illegal diversion of the political fund is not the first time.New one will no doubt become apparent. It could be worse.I suspect there are a lot of financing problem which have yet to come to light. Specified Secrets Protection Bill will put this regulation into practice on December 10.I have qualms about restriction of the right to know and decreasing of funding issues out in the open."
3617,"This judicial issue is very difficult to solve,because hie judicial system is purposed on justice for people, Furthermore, trial is needed fairness and accuracy.If people who judge a defendant cannot have overview of incidents, this system won't work properly. However,for lay judges, They are not accustomed to face sever decision and situation, but one citizen, So, I think it is important for government to improve this system which people do not have heavy burden at the court as possible. Although i the trial accuser's claim in not accepted, government in Japan will need to make some efforts about judicial reform."
3618,"I think politician must be honest. Seeing recent political circumstances, if we may be able to find evidences against their policies. When I have read this article, I am disappointed the politician Although he explained that he did not have inappropriate money spending by himself, he was not able to mangy his staffs. He will be responsible for caring. Every one in Japan must regard spending money at SM bar as bad thing. I think I want a politician such this article to have morality."
3619,"Given the optimistic, so it might be good. However, iTunes users are downloading pay money and download music. If music you do not know is entered people's iPhone,it will be surprising That's too bad."
3620,"I thought politicians who are nationally representation should take the right course of action. Recently, politicians' scandal is reported well. People were disappointed the politician every time, and it has lost reliance. Since politician's scandals does not happen any more, we should continue supervising."
3622,"I agree with your opinion. Politicians should be responsible for their own finance. In Ms. Obuchi's case, she escape from the explanation for her political money problem. But in reality, the Japanese political financial system cannot be changed. Before Ms, Obuchi 's problem was apparent, there have been lots of political financial problem. Moreover, political money problem is not a Japanese characteristic problem but a common problem all over the world. It is tremendously hard to prevent politicians from spending their public funding illegally."
3623,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that the lay judge system should be discussed more and more. However,The lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Thanks to the lay judge system, we can act with a reason and a order."
3624,"I agree with your opinion. Such as this news, politician must be faithful and honest.betraying people's trust is especially that. This problem may be uneasy to solve."
3625,"I agree with your opinion. I also think there are many problems in the lay judge system. If participants bear the emotional burden, they will get behind in their livings. However, it is certain that the lay judge system has good influence on our lives."
3626,"I partly agree with you.Surely,In the court, when people judge a person, law expert may be much more better. But in Japan,people do not want to be interested in a court so much. In that point, lay judge system will be expected."
3627,"When I read your accurate opinion, I can understand this article deeply. I also think it is a bad side of it to download automatically. I can understand the people who griped that the record took up valuable iPhone storage space. However, it is a great strategy of Apple to provide people using iTunes with the record for free."
3628,"If the SM bar is admitted legally, visiting SM bar is not criticized. There are many kind of people who have uncommon sexual tendencies. Therefore, whether going to SM bar is decided by his own will. we cannot have the right to blame it. However, if the SM bar's spending is used from public funding or contribution, Mr. Miyazawa should apologize to people for spending money badly."
3629,"I approve your opinion. civil judge system has large influence on civil judge's life after the trial. Japan should learn from other countries to manage civil judge system better. In this case, the judge system caused her heavy mental stress. However,if the judge system administer better,more and more civilian have interested in laws and judges."
3630,"After read this article, I was disappointed at this news because the top politicians do not have responsibility for their positions. It is completely out of the question that they use our tax for private using. They representative of Japanese citizen so I want them to more concentrate on their political works not on private amusement."
3632,"I approve with your opinion. We must consider other people's situation and feelings. It is very important thing. Also I think all of us should take to heart this complication. Bono's complication is large scale and have influenced lots of people in the world. But in daily life, there are many like instances. So we should not think this complication is not related to our daily life."
3636,"I agree with your opinion. I also can understand Bono's idea. He must have considered this idea as best means to everyone listen his songs freely. Although he should apologize to users, he shouldn't be blame so."
3638,"I was very surprised at this news because I've never heard that a country changes its national flag. I can understand that current New Zealander want to change a flag just because New Zealand is an independent state now and don't need great supports by the UK. However, on the other hand, I suspect that New Zealander dismiss a current flag and accept a new flag without feeling a sense of incongruity."
3639,"I agree with your opinion. I think lay judge system is not fault and it is Indispensable in judiciary in Japan. As you say, in order not to cause the happening, lay judge system should be under review."
3640,"It is no exaggeration to say that the latest politician scandal hit the prime minister Abe. Mr.Miyazawa was suspected that his political support group spent 18230 yen at the sex club. He emphasized he had never been there. Whether he went there or not , I think the Japanese people lost trust of him as well as other politicians. Moreover I think Mr.Abe is responsible for such scandals because the politicians were appointed by Mr.Abe. Many of politicians have no awareness of responsibility as representative. They should think what to do for country."
3641,"The amount of money of the political fund that the staff of Miyazawa used the an SM bar is not so big,but in these days such as people investigate about the purpose for which money is spent of the political fund strictly statesmen should be discreetly,I think."
3642,"I think the members of the cabinet should check the expenses of ministers and modify them if there are any faults. I have two reasons. First,it is done at the cabinet of Koizumi. And one of the members of them said yes it works well when PM chooses ministers. Second,funds such as slush funds of legislators are necessary evil. Because when they want to do something in the diet, they should make political factions, or unite for a policy that they want to realize. Therefore,they use many funds without concerning they are legal or illegal. But without doing so, Japan's politics is not useful for Japanese. In my conclusion,we should rethink the personnel affairs."
3643,"I agree with your opinion. I was so shocked when I read this article. I think also that top politicians have less responsibility. If his abuse were true, he also should resign."
3645,"I think so,too. The situation of the cabinet goes to the direction where is reverse to the aim that is called 'activity of the woman' the Mr.Abe advocated. It is very interesting how he'll deal with this."
3647,"Since Mr. Miyazawa is a minister who are appointed due to the corruption of Ms.Obuchi, I thought he is reliable and irrelevant to disgraceful affairs. Therefore, I felt disappointed that the same thing was repeated. I think it will be more and more difficult for prime minister Shinzo Abe to keep supports and trusts by a people . Mr.Miyazawa have to reflect on this problem seriously and make every effort to regain a reliance"
3649,Using our tax for private use is completely out of the question. They have no responsibilities for what they do. I want them to have realization of representative Japanese citizen.
3652,"When I heard the news , I am surprised. I am surprised that officers who should observe the law invaded them. So we should observe officers' act."
3656,"I thought that their this scheme is very selfish and troublesome. In addition to this, their explanation, 'deep fear that these songs that we poured our life into over the last few years might not be heard', is very childish and deserves a disgust. There are so many singers or artists who are afraid that their works won't be paid attention to and bought at all. But they are trying to make a good thing with a sense of fear. As long as they are professional, they have to make effort to create terrific and worthy things."
3657,"I do not agree with you so much.We have human rights what kind of music we listen, so I think some people would be unpleasant and it is not good that Bono give away the album even if it is free of charge."
3660,I also approve of your opinion. A political fund belongs to national. Obuchi does not have the idea. She has to examine herself. Naturally she resigned. She lost public confidence.
3662,I am surprised that controversies about whether to change national flag took place.I have never ever seen controversies. I think these controversies are in-previous.
3663,"It is a difficult problem in these days that the Internet has spread. Such problems can be occurred at any time.In this case, this problem just happened to the famous and popular Irish rock band and caused heavy damage,so it created a great sensation,I think."
3666,"I agree with you in terms of the trouble of storage,so I think they should have sent their music not automatically but able to choose."
3667,"I have been convinced to your opinion. The right to choose will be required even if download is no charge. The album of U2 downloaded also to my ipod. I was dissatisfied, seeing it. If I did not download, supposing it was able to choose. And probably, dissatisfaction was not felt, either."
3669,"I think it is very deeply impressive that the New Zealand which was once a British colony is going to remove Union Jack from the national flag. And judging from a way of thinking of the post-colonialism, I think that this is a proper trend."
3671,I agree with you because I want the politician to do their duty and not to hurt their work's pride badly. I hope they won't do bad things any more.
3675,"I also approve of your opinion. It is not perfect although a jury system is a good idea. Those who participate in a jury system are beginners. There are few people who have got used to a cruel photograph and incident. This incident became an opportunity to consider the necessity for the care of the heart to a lay judge. It needs to be tried hard for reducing mental damage. Probably, I get interested in this incident from now on also."
3677,I agree with your opinion. I think also that they are blinded by self-interest. I wish they work for citizens not for themselves.
3679,I was surprised when I heard this news. However the point is not whether they paid on what kind of sex pub and so on but also they paid on private things. As a result people such as them limit to the rule due to their idleness! Why don't they care about others who works hard and seriously? Never make hard workers reluctant. They should be ashamed of themselves.
3680,"I was really disappointed in the statesmen in Japan to when I read the article. Because they resigned for such scandals. But these days, there are a lot of funding scandals of statesmen. I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations against that. In the first place, politics is for protecting our lives. So we should originally watch the current status of politics for ourselves. In other words, the scandal was caused due to shortage of awareness regarding politics among nations. So I think it is necessary to raise politics awareness among nations."
3690,"i heard this news and was shocking. A bureaucrat and the minister should do appropriate work. Therefore, a third party should supervise them. I think that the third party is people."
3695,"When I heard this news,I was not shocked.Because the relation between politics and money has been strongly played up by mass media.In my opinion,it is not good thing in terms of humanity,but in terms of politics, it is no use denying that deed"
3697,"I think this is very sad news because these scandals will stop any good flows of political consequences. There have been many political problems in Japan, so we have no time to attend to these news essentially. And, I also felt these news seems to have an aspect of just power game. This is why I god so sad."
3699,"When I heard this news at the first time, l feel angry. The most thing surprised me is Ms.Obuchi 's behavior. The cabinet of Abe is making efforts to enhance the stand of Japanese women, but Ms.Obuchi's action made that situation worse. I can't forgive her behavior as one of Japanese Women"
3700,"I agreed with your opinion too.It is true that iphone users including me were at a loss what action they should do.They might lose their temper,but in terms of U2,they only want to know everyone their music.Thus,we iphone users should understand their feelings."
3703,"When I read the article, I could understand what had occurred to my iTunes finally. I had been so surprised to see the album on my iTunes which I hadn't had any memories to buy, and then thought 'It must be my mistake...oh, I waste my money.' So I was relieved when reading the article, but the same time I also felt the system bothered me because the album fill some capacity of my PC and iPhone."
3704,"I strongly agree with your opinion,I too became disillusioned with the Japanese law system.Japanese citizen judge system should be optional. Those who dislikes blood ,gruesome scene should be removed from that system.It isn't too much to say that this is a little bit infringement of personal human right."
3710,"I think this kinds of free downloading is part of advertisements. Because these musics are free and if you do not like it, then you can throw it. So you do not have to keep it. Also iTunes is the service of Apple. Apple is independent company.So they can do whatever they want for their customers. Of course, sometimes this kind of troubles would happen. But it should be accepted."
3714,"I disagree your opinion, because 'to delete' is a very trouble work for me. Please imagine the situation, not only U2 but many artists adopt the system. In your iTunes and iPhone, there will appear many strange albums. The capacity will fill instantly, and you have to delete them. Isn't it so trouble?"
3717,"I agree with your opinion. I also think our rights is protected by the laws such as the Constitution, and the case is a violation of them. It is very serious problem."
3719,"I agree with your opinion. I'm fed up with these time of political news recently, and whenever I hear them, I have fears for the Japanese future. Many people also do that, I guess. These matter seem to be bullying of adults."
3720,"When I read this article, I felt anger. Recently, I heard news that a statesman spent office money for his private many times. I cannot understand their feelings. I want the Japanese Government to take measures for problems like that, and I hope that another problem like that will not happen."
3721,"I read the article with great surprise. It is sad that, they are not proud of their national flag. I noticed that I am happy because I like the national flag of Japan the best in all national flags. 'Hinomaru' is very simple, and can be drawn easily so I think it is a great design."
3724,"I was assent to Mr.Key's thought of changing flag because I think New Zealanders should identify themselves by changing flags and showing independent of British colony. However,changing flags may lead to worsen the relationship between the UK. Thus,it is a too difficult problem between the pride of independent state to international relations."
3725,"I was very surprised to hear the news because I'd never thought New Zealander desired to change their flags. The article told me that one of the reason of it is historical backgrounds, which Japanese also had. So I asked to myself that whether I wanted to change the Japanese flags or not, but my answer was no, because I was very accustomed to seeing our current flag. I think a national flag represents the nation so much, so changing it is not so easy and will give the people much discomfort."
3728,"I agree with the change. It is a good trial to change New Zealand's national flag and re-define its identity. And the idea of holding a referendum twice-the first being about the flag designs, and the second being about whether to adopt the chosen flag design-is an ideal way of reaching to a national consensus and making the nation's important decision. I think that the island nation enough takes into account both advocates and opponents of adopting the new flag. Since a basis for making the policy is already complete, all it needs is careful consideration and discussion!"
3730,"I respect Mr.Key for what he did. There are two reasons. First, His idea is the best to distance the country from its British identity and heritage. Its design has been imaged British colony by the Union Flag. I hope that it can increase their spirit of independence to remove it. Second, I think it is democratic process to change the national flag by referendum. He accept and reflect to citizen's opinion. But, they had better argue more, between the government and people. I wish it becomes a satisfactory conclusion for them."
3731,"I cannot allow her behavior too. Although female activity is delightful, I want to lose disgrace. We need to do our best as a Japanese woman of the future!"
3732,"I think so too. People who chose for lay judge system may experience psychological suffering. In my opinion, they need to install mental supporters who can reduce their mental burden."
3733,"I was not able to understand this problem, either. From the campaign of Apple, profits of 100 million dollars are produced and, seemingly, 26 million download was attained. But, like of you, there are some users who are not pleased that their memory is used freely. I think that it was put on the advertising strategy."
3737,"I don't think that the change of frag means they are not proud of that, but maybe they are trying to strong their own identity of the country by the change. However, I really agree with you in the point that you are really feeling good toward the Japanese frag! I also think Japanese frag is very nice even if it is very simple. If it were to be changed, I would feel very shocked! Anyway, it is true that the national frag is very important for all of us!"
3738,"When I read this article, I was very surprised to know that New Zealand was trying to change their national flag because I didn't know the fact before reading this. As the report says, it is absolutely true that the national flag plays very important role considering their identity. Therefore, I think this is both important and difficult problem. In the case of Australia, it is quite different from that in Canada which changed its national flag and I couldn't imagine that many Australians thought they didn't want to change the flag because they have competed in Olympic Games under the flag and there's a sense of pride in it. Maybe in New Zealand, I think there will be a lot of opinions as well as in Australia, but I think the process of thinking about changing the design to one that better reflects their status as a modern, independent nation is the most important. I think the way of the Prime Minister's thinking, retaining the current flag is a possible outcome of this process and the consideration of options will be done carefully, respectfully and with no presumption in favor of change, is so nice. Anyway, I am very interested in this news so looking forward to the outcome of two referendums."
3739,"When I read this article, I was surprised to know that the national flag of New Zealand will change possibly. When I was a third grade student of junior high school, I have been to New Zealand and lived with local families for two weeks. I enjoyed this home-stay program and I came to love New Zealand, so I am very interested in this problem. National flags are not mere flags. They are symbol of nations. Now, the design of New Zealand's flag symbolised 'a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed'. Mr Key think that New Zealanders should adopt a design which symbolizes the independent nation 'New Zealand'. I agree with his opinion. However, I think that New Zealanders should consider whether they change their flag or not cautiously."
3743,"I think that it is very good to change the design of the national flag. New Zealand has been colonized by England for years, and the Union Jack was drawn also on the national flag. However, it is possible to make a flag that incorporates their own culture of New Zealand, New Zealand will be able to show the world that the country is a full-fledged independent country. In addition, national flag is an important symbol that gives characterize image the country to the people, so many people will be able to catch a glimpse of the traditional culture of the country."
3745,I agree with your comment. I'm sure that New Zealand really would like to express that the country has been independent from England by removing Union Jack which are in the national flag. I hope that it comes true that the new national flag is decided on.
3749,"I was so surprised by the fact that Canada has changed their national flag. Besides, in New Zealand, there is a move for changing their national flag. If the flag will be changed, we will be confused but realise that New Zealanders have something to claim to the world. I think this way of assertion is very effective. However, if an argument like this will occur in Japan, I disagree to the opinion that the national flag should be changed. I love Japanese national flag."
3752,"I think so. it is a too difficult problem. New Zealanders shouldn't decide hurry. If Mr Key stuck to his opinion and change the national flag, New Zealand can show the pride of independent state. However, the relationship between New Zealand and UK may be fragile."
3753,"When I read this article, I was a little perturbed. Mr. Key insists that changing the national flag is necessary for 'independent nation'. What national flags stand for? I think they stand for integration. Therefore, nobody must force anybody to respect a national flag. It is because that causes the division of the nation. Moreover, it causes deadly uplift of the nationalism. So I hope New Zealanders unify after having changed their national flag. And I want to coexist respecting each national flag. New Zealanders should closely examine all aspects of changing national flag."
3754,"When I read this article, I was surprised that New Zealand will try to change the national flag. I think that the national flag carry a tradition and a history of the country. Therefore, It is not easy to change the national flag and the national anthem. I think it is important for New Zealanders to think what is their symbol. I agree with changing the national flag. It is because that New Zealand became an independent nation. It is already an colonial. I think New Zealanders should adopt its design which symbolizes an independent nation. In Japan, we know that Japanese anthem carries a tradition inherited and a painful past of a war. Therefore, we should keep it. If a topic that whether Japan change the flag and the anthem or not, we should discuss carefully."
3756,"If what Miyazawa said is true, it is not responsible for him but stuff. I think it is a individual problem of the stuff, so Miyazawa does not have to resign."
3760,"When I read this article, I think New Zealand don't have to change its flag.New Zealand's flag include the UK's national flag, however, I hadn't noticed about that until I read this sentence. So It's not a big problem for me.Moreover if its flag is changed to a new flag, the history they made cannot be changed. Therefore , in my opinion, there is no sense in changing the flag."
3763,I agree with you. I cannot forgive that staff from a support group spent office money at a sex club.There are many cases where Japan minister cause a scandal.I hope a scandal like this will not happen again too.
3764,"I think so. Funding scandals of politicians are also treachery against the Japanese people. I think confidence in politicians is very important to be engaged in political activity. Therefore they must have more responsibility for their behaviors. Then, I think more people will come to have interest in politics and go to elections."
3767,"When I read your comment, I really agree with you and I also feel sorry for Aoki Hifumi. I also think most Japanese are not good at saying 'No' or 'I can't'. Such character is naturally Japanese good point, but at the same time, it is sometimes bad point. Therefore, I think your idea that we can learn another countries where there are similar problems about this. We have just started such system so I think it's very important to consider how other countries' situations are. Anyway, I also think this kind of matter will have great influence on our lives so we all have to consider this problem."
3769,"I don't attach importance to a national flag.Changing a national flag is a matter of no importance.It is true that we feel national unity when we see our national flag.However,I think that it is an expedient to symbolize a nation.Some people says that the national flag of Japan reminds us of militarism.However,the national flag of Japan is a mark and an insignia.When they criticize a national flag,they seem to want to forget what to do in order to prevent militarism.We have to discuss what is most important."
3770,I agree with you. Mr.miyazawa's support group wasted office money.Their money is a tax. The law regulates how to spend their money.He was chosen by the voters because they expect him to do what is good for them.They should have wasted their money.
3773,"Reading this article, I sympathised Aoki. It is very difficult to refuse being ray judgement. But I think the system, that ray judgements would be informed if grisly photos are to be introduced as evidence and they could refuse participating in trial, is needed. To continue lay judge system, burden of lay judgement should be decreased."
3774,"After reading this news, I became aware of U2 and listened to songs of their new album I got in my iphone.Considering it, Bono's strategy is very effective. And by expressing apology, he tried to restore public confidence. I think he is clever."
3775,"When I heard this news, I felt angry and thought they were not suitable for politician. But recently, I heard Yuko Obuchi was allowed to run for election.I think it is citizen's duty to choose the person who is suitable for politician."
3776,"I have same opinion. As politicians scandals is revealed, political party lost people's trust. Politicians should behave correctly."
3779,"I was surprised when I read this news. This is because I have not thought that a national flag changes so far. According to this news, an opinion to change a national flag seems to have a pro and con. If Japanese Government says that we may change a national flag, I strongly object. Like this news, I think that we should not change a national flag even if a Japanese national flag did not express the Japanese history. This is because the national flag is the thing which symbolized Japan for a long time. I think that we should deepen the opinion about the national flag ."
3783,"I was surprised that I read this article very much. This is because it has not heard that it changes the national flag.However, I think that it is good to forget a past, and to advance.If a national flag changes; historic for the world and historic not to mention it for Australia countries.When the design imitates Japan, I think that it is interesting."
3785,"I agree to your opinion. I think the politician to have to be serious for the nation. However, I may not regain the trust of the nation if there is such a scandal. I do not want politicians to raise such a thing with twice."
3786,"When I read this article, I agree that New Zealand would change its national flag. Of course, some people disagree. The reason is that there were a lot of people who have fought for the national flag. However, the design of New Zealand's flag symbolised 'a colonial and post-colonial era whose time has passed.' New Zealand should have its own flag .For example, Canada changed its national flag in the past. Thus the flag should be changed."
3789,"I agree with you. It is because changing national flag is a good way to forget a past and to advance. It is important for New Zealand for the future. In addition to, it is good historically, too."
3790,"When I read this article, I was surprised and then felt good. National flag shows nation's feature. I think it is strange that New Zealand's flag includes Union flag. So I think New Zealand changing flag is good thing."
3793,I have same opinion. I thought Bono should not have made his music downloaded in iTunes of many people and I was surprised that Bono could do such thing.
3794,I agree with your opinion. It is very important to improve the treatment of lay judges and the change you mention is great progress.
3795,I have same opinion. Nations have there own features and it is not needed that New Zealand's flag includes Union flag. I agree with the idea that New Zealand change the national flag.
3796,"I completely agree with you. Although, as you say, there are pros and cons about changing the national flag, this selection seems to be done in deep consideration, which I value as a very ideal way of making national decision. So, I am looking forward to the result of the two referendums, too."
3797,"I was surprised at Australian's opinion about whether national flag is changed or not. I have no idea like Australian's. I thought it is better for people to change the flag in order to make a new history for colonial country before. After I read the article, my thinking is change. National flag show that the country exist. There are many representation about Japan such as sushi , sumo. But I think National flag is most clearest representation about Japan. Although how many times are passed, people have a national flag as a common representation about Japan. And every countries have a flag, so it is easy to compare among countries. Sushi and sumo can be arranged by foreign , but National flag show the country's history and can't be arranged easily. So National flag is so important for country's identity. I thought just about National flag at first, but that is so deep meaning and that has people's feeling and proud."
3798,"I agree your opinion about changing the flag is effective way of assertion for around world. In addition, I think movement of changing the flag is enough to assertion for around the worlds. Leaving the British flag is more better to impression to England and coming generation ."
3799,I think New Zealand doesn't need to change national flag because the people recognize the flag as their own national flag for a long time. Though it's strange the UK's national flag is included even the mark is part of the national flag. And changing flag isn't easy. Many procedures will need. So I think the flag should be kept.
3801,"I was so surprised to hear the news.I didn't know that Canada has changed their national flag and New Zealand try to change their flag.New Zealand is now not a colony but an independent nation.So Mr.Key try to change the national flag to erase the image of a colony.I think it is good idea.Whereas,national flag carry a variety of things, glorious and disgraceful history of the country, thought, culture, and heritage.Therefore I think they need more deep council."
3802,"I think this is a difficult problem. Actually,it is important to listen opinions of ordinary person by using a lay judge system. However, we must think about feelings of lay judge. If I am chosen as a lay judge, I will be anxious. Furthermore, If I am shown grisly photos, I will feel a strong stress like Aoki. So, the Japanese Government must consider a counter-plan for this problem."
3804,"I think so too. This problem is not easy to solve. Actually, lay judge system is good idea. However, this system lacks consideration for lay judges' mental damage. So, I want the Japanese Government to take measures for this problem as soon as possible."
3805,"I think so. I also think a national flag represents the nation so much. In Japan, There are a lot of tradition and history of Japanese in our nation flag. Therefore, it is not so easy to change a national flag."
3806,"When I read this article, I was surprised at two things. The first thing I was surprised at is the fact that Canada has changed their national flag . I did not know this fact. The second thing I was surprised at is that New Zealand try to change the design of their national flag. Changing national flag may be help to forget a dark past. However, I think New Zealand must not change the design of their national flag, because the design was loved by a lot of New Zealanders for a long time."
3808,National flag is one of a symbol of the country. Therefore each people should be proud of their flags and the flag should be organized with elements of the country. New Zealand is a member of the U.K. It is natural that Union Jack is in the national flag. However New Zealand is an independent country. I can understand some of them would change the flag. Anyhow foreigners must not jump in this issue.
3812,"I think that it is a difficult challenge to change a national flag. This is because,the national flag is a classic thing and informing the country all over the world. I think they may be dissatisfied with a current national flag, but it can be expected that they disturb a past tradition when they change it. In consideration of a thing that It is not only the thing of current people and I want you to think carefully."
3813,"A national flag is a symbol of their people. We can bind together because of it, so it plays a really important role. I think national anthem has the same implication. However, in Japan, there are some people dealing with the national anthem neglectfully. It is very shameful because national anthem express own identity and I do not understand why they treat them irresponsibility. We should be proud of national symbol."
3825,"After read the article, I thought they are not proud of their national flag. But I can understand that current New Zealand want to change a flag just because New Zealand is independent of United Kingdom and don't need supports by the United Kingdom. However I think New Zealand should decide more carefully. Because the relationship between New Zealand and UK may be worse."
3827,I agree with your opinion.Some people's financial impropriety is not scruple to lead to suspicion against politician entirety.I hope a person of integrity become politician and politician doesn't be faithless.
3829,"I think so too.Nowadays,streaming music is in currency.It will be normal to keep the music you like and throw away the one you do not like."
3830,I think whether the design is loved by a lot of New Zealanders is not known until the referendum.It will be decided the weight of unlearning dark past or preserving tradition and history.
3832,"I was surprised this news because I had not know it at all until I first read the article. I learned that each country's flag shows the country's history, culture, and identity. Also, when the consideration of the nation is changed, the new national flag take over present national flag. This is as a matter of course. But I have forgotten it, because national flag was permanent and no substitute existence for me. I am not Australian. So, I have no right to decide weather Australia should change its national flag. But I will approve the decision about conclusion of Australia's national flag."
3833,"When I read this article, I was so shocked.I think that they are blinded by self-interest.I wish they work for citizens not for themselves."
3834,"I was very surprised at this news.Nations flag is important. So I understand their action. But I have not heard the change of the flag. Though I have a little of uncomfortable feelings, their intention should be respected."
3842,"I was really surprised about this news because I hadn't known that New Zealand is trying to change the national flag. I completely agree with the opinion that that national flags play the important role in identifying their nationalities. If Japanese government tried to change the national flag, I would object to that movement. That's why I love Japanese flag and accustomed to look this flag. This article gave me the opportunity to think about the role of national flags."
3843,"I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag. Because it is bad thing for both New Zealanders and British people. When we imagine our nations, we draw our flags to head at first. So flags are very important symbols for nations. And If there are New Zealanders who think it uncomfortable that national flag contains Union Flag, British people also must want to change it. So I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag."
3844,"I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag. Because it is bad thing for both New Zealanders and British people. When we imagine our nations, we draw our flags to head at first. So flags are very important symbols for nations. And If there are New Zealanders who think it uncomfortable that national flag contains Union Flag, British people also must want to change it. So I think it is necessary for New Zealanders to change their national flag."
3846,"It is very strange story that country change its national flag. Before I read this article I can't understand why people in New Zealand want to change it. However, there is background that country was colonial. In consideration of this, I think New Zealand may change its flag, because it may bring new image of New Zealand and also can be wiped away the past. On the other hand, if country choose to change the flag, it may break its traditional image and fade that it was colonial country in past. So, people in New Zealand should considerate carefully."
3847,"I think it ideal for New Zealanders to remake their national banner.In terms of arousal of nationalism,it bring about a lot of boon.Looking back,Canada also changed their flag to distance the country from its British identity and heritage.And now,of course she has some internal troubles,but compared with the past it eminently shows its independent from UK.Thus I think Australia should follow suit this practice."
3850,"I think so too. Politicians are representative of citizens, so they should act with responsibility that they are elected. However, many politicians are lacking responsibility and they make us disappointed. We have to elect carefully."
3851,I agree with you. They are professional singer. So they should make effort to make good staff by their own.
3852,"A New Zealand national flag should be changed. There are two reason. First, a national flag is similar to an Australian national flag. A national flag is a national symbol, so it's a problem to make a mistake.Next, the former national flag have meaning with the regrettable and cruel at the war age. The people who wish the New Zealand future would be encouraged for making the national flag new. If this change is decided by a strict voting, the national flag should be changed."
3854,"I agree with your opinion.Considering its people and historical matters, referendum held many times is the amicable arrangement in changing the banner .As you remark in your comments,I too think all they should do is careful consideration and prudent discussion."
3856,"I have already known that U2's latest album has sent to individual's iTunes because i also have given the music automatically. But, I don't think this is such a big problem in the world. so I think apple should take responsibility for this problem. Of course, Bono has some responsibility. But, if the control system of iTunes worked well, the problem didn't cause. iTunes should make the rule more strict."
3857,"I thought this article was very interesting. National flag is a symbol of the country. Many countries has historical reasons in their flag. In this article, changing flag referendum will show people's mind to the country. I am looking forward to the consequences."
3860,"I was surprised at the news. In these days, I hear a lot of news that Japanese politician use tax in wrong ways. Politicians should think about the figure which there should be of the politician. And the corruption of the politician should deal with a heavy punishment"
3861,"Lay judge system is an important part of the democracy, because citizens are able to participate in the administration of justice, however, they sometimes suffer from the stuff that they see in the process of trial such as cruel photos. I personally think they should abide that because they should know that they possibly see such kind of things before the trials begin."
3862,"I agree with your opinion. If the same things happen to me, I will be confused and won't feel good."
3864,I was surprised at this news because I've never known that the country changes its national flag. I can understand that people in New Zealand are willing to change the flag because New Zealand is an independent state and don't need great supports by the UK. I hope New Zealand go well.
3865,"I was surprised that New Zealand will try to change its national flag because I didn't know that the national flag can be changed and Canada had changed its flag.I think the national flag should appeal its identity, so I think it is very important for New Zealanders to consider changing its flag.Then, they must know its history and what New Zealand is. Take account of the colonial era by UK, I agree with changing flag."
3866,I agree with your opinion. I think that lay judge system has good influence. This is because it thinks that we came to be interested in a judge. But we can make rules about care of participation of the lay judge
3867,"I myself like U2's music since I was little because my father also likes U2. I personally think that everyone should listen to the stuff before saying it's a rude act or something like that. However, from others point of view, it is certainly a rude act that they were sent a music they did not want. I want those people to know how marvelous U2's music is."
3869,I agree with you. I want politicians to make good use of the tax of the country.
3870,"I think that changing national flag may worsen the relationship between UK. And I suppose everyone have to think about the role of national flag ,too."
3871,I agree with you. this is the good chance which New Zealand appeal the world that they are independent state.
3873,"I think that now the jury system is the duty of the Japanese people. In trial,juries which consist of citizen carry out great tasks for fair judge and are indispensable to democracy. So juries must endure some mental anguish. But judges also must consider the mental anguish of juries."
3877,"I think the deed which U2 did is not bad thing. New album of U2 is free and is not annoyance for most people. But apples give people who use iTunes a choice which download or not. Personally I like U2 ,so I'm happy."
3878,"I agree to your opinion. I also think lay judge system has good influence on our lives. Naturally enough, the purpose of judicial judge is to protect citizens against inequality, so I think it is necessary for citizens to involve in it."
3880,"Politics and money is an inseparable relationship . Politics needs big money and this money is given by private citizens. So,politician must control his money which use political activity exactly. If he himself doesn't know money which use illegally he must take responsibility for his administrative ability."
3881,"When I read this article, I was surprised because it is big big decision to change the national flag. If they change the national flag, it will influence to over the world. I wonder New Zealand should make a decision carefully."
3882,"I agree with you. At first, I also wondered why there was the album on my iTunes account. In my case, I enjoyed listening their album, but I think some were angry with it. So I also think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not."
3884,"I think New Zealand people better take their own way. Now New Zealand is not a colony of US,I think they don't need to continue to put up their national flag . But also I think they don't need change their one. So, this problem depends on the way that New Zealand people think about their national flag."
3885,"When I found the title of the article, I felt so interested in this news. I think referendum on whether to change the national flag is good. History in all countries is changing every second. I think that changing the national flag is good way to show the mind of a nation."
3887,"I agree with your opinion. If people don't like these songs, they can delete these songs. So, I think it's not their faults. Moreover, the whole capacity in the iTunes is huge enough to memorize a lot of songs. People should not care of these songs."
3888,I agree to your opinion. And I feel sad when they resign their post because of trifling scandal. So I also think they should carry out politics for the benefit of the nations instead of us.
3890,I do not think this is not good news. Because NZ has a long history with Britain. People of England immigrated to the island which is now NZ. This is the origin of NZ. So I think people of NZ should respect today's flag. Because there is here is Union Flag which shows closed connection between NZ and England. I think nations and their flags should represent their history and custom. Therefore New Zealanders should be proud of their history with Great Britain and the flag.
3896,I agree with you. I also think that the national flag carries a tradition and a history of the country. And it is also a symbol of a nation to show a current nation at the same time. And New Zealand is now an independent nation. So I agree with changing the national flag.
3900,"I think so,too. We have to change the lay judge system not to hurt the members of lay judge physically and mentally."
3908,"I was disappointed to know this news.They wasted a lot of money collected by people.They had to spend their money to do something good for people supporting them.It is true that they have to collect a lot of money to take part in politics.However,I think that there is something wrong with their political sense.I want politicians to do clean politics."
3915,"When I heard the news for the first time, I was disappointed deeply. Certainly, Mr. Miyazawa said he didn't go the club. However, it is not the crux about the problem. What he is to blame for is that he paid money for inappropriate things. This expense just lower his dignity. In order to be a good politician, he should recognize his social position strongly."
3916,"When I heard the news for the first time, I was disappointed deeply. Certainly, Mr. Miyazawa said he didn't go the club. However, it is not the crux about the problem. What he is to blame for is that he paid money for inappropriate things. This expense just lower his dignity. In order to be a good politician, he should recognize his social position strongly."
3920,"I agree with you. I think the national flag should be symbolized its identity, so it is good to change the flag in New Zealand because existing flag is influenced by the UK."
3921,I think so. The latest scandals made Japanese people angry. The politicians should have responsible for his work and work hard for the future.
3924,"When I heard the news, I was surprised because I didn't know New Zealand want to change their national flag. I've never heard such a news, so maybe there are few previous examples so far. So, I think this decision needs great courage. Generally, national flag represents the nation's history and tradition, identity. Moreover, if the national flag is changed, the international community may become confused because the flag is known broadly as the symbol of the nation. Just because a nation want to change their national flag because the flag reminds people of the colonial days, it doesn't follow that the nation can change it."
3925,"I think so. The national flag is the symbol of the nation. many people in the world recognize nations by seeing the flags. If the national flag is changed, a lot of citizens would not regard New Zealand exactly."
3930,"I agree with your opinion. It is hard for me to watch such a terrible pictures. Therefore I can understand why he suffered. So, I hate this role. The government understands the pains and I think that it is necessary to take measures."
3931,"I agree with your opinion. I don't have iTunes account, but if I had iTunes account, I would be disgusted and angry to apple."
3932,"When I read this article, I was surprised that the chief didn't take responsibility. Indeed I was shocked to the fact that abuse was happened , but to me, the most serious incident is responsibility. I think Chief should take responsibility."
3933,"When I heard this news, I was very regrettable. newspaper often report politician's corruption . So I wasn't surprised the news . but I was furious with a politician's using our tax for their entertainment. I think politics and a gold problem are a kind of word in fashion. We should also watch a politician severely now."
3934,"I agree to your opinion, too. A politician shouldn't use the political fund privately. I wish for a punish severe on the politician."
3935,I'm confident in a Japanese flag. Central red Maru thinks Japan shows itself. Japan changed a national flag after the World War 2 .I think it's when it's the national reformation to change a national flag. I think Japanese should watch New Zealand decision quietly.
3936,"I completely agree with you. I think lay judge system is necessary, because it can examine objectively. However it make people who participate in lay judge shocked because of see gruesome evidence. So government should improve this system."
3937,"I think so too. There are backgrounds in New Zealand that country was colonized. So I think New Zealand can change its national flag. However, national flag is symbol of its country, so the New Zealand people should discuss carefully whether change there national flag or not."
3940,"There are many cases that Japanese politicians are criticized because of their way to use money these days. In almost all the cases, the money which is used is our tax. I feel anger especially about this. I personally think there should be something like more strict rules about politicians corruptions."
3941,"National flag is an identity of the people of each country, so changing it is a really big matter. I want New Zealand to think deeply and create a cool flag that directly shows their nationality."
3944,I completely agree with your idea. New Zealand doesn't have to change its own national flag that they have been using for long time.
3945,I completely agree with your idea. It is really a shameful thing that Japanese politicians quit their job because of their scandal.
3946,I totally agree with you. U2 is one of the best bands in the world. There musics are wonderful.
3947,I totally agree with your idea. I also think that juries should endure some mental anguish.
3948,"I think it is natural demand to change New Zealand's flag, because it is not a colony of UK any longer. However, like Australia, there is another opinion that many Australians have fought and died under that flag sadly, and they have pride in it. The frag represents the country strongly, so nationalities should think about it carefully."
3949,"I think so,too. I'm interested how womens' status are enhanced by Abe's policy."
3950,"I agree with you. National flag symbolizes the nation's feature, so it's quite natural for current New Zealand to change it's flag."
3954,"I think so,too. Latest politicians caused politic money problems. They should be responsible for their job."
3955,"I think so, too. I think Apple shouldn't ignore this situation."
3956,"I think so,too. Judges should support jury and citizen judge."
3960,"I think so too. Not only opposition parties but also we, citizens, have to keep watch on activities of the ruling party. To be specific, we should make an organization composed of people regardless of young and old, men and women."
3961,I agree with you. U2 should have given away their latest album to those who were eager to listen to their songs.
3962,I agree with you. I think the lay judge system is pretty good but lay judges shouldn't be given mental shock through the trial because they join the trial without their will.
3965,I think this problem could have been solved before this happens when I read this article. That is because the problem like this could have been expected. And I totally agree with its measure. But there will be people who are not able to see such grotesque foots and so on. We have to rethink new idea as to serving as a lay judge.
3966,I agree with your opinion. I think lay judge system leaves much room for improvement too. We have to continue to rethink new idea.
3967,"I was surprised and glad when I read this article. That is because I can get U2's album for free.As to problem, I think this is not so bad like such. Moreover U2 is very popular artist all over the world. I can't understand why this problem was so serious all over the world. But certainly,If I don't like U2 much or hate U2,My opinion might have changed.Much of criticism may be from such people who don't like U2 much."
3968,I agree with you. I think he want many people to be happy too. I don't understand why this thing or he is criticized by a lot of people all over the world.
3969,At first I was so disappointed when I read this article. That is because our money is spent to such sex club. But I think there are many problem like this which is not found in public and the problem like this lead to political apathy among the young.
3970,I agree with your opinion. Recently these problem happen many times. These problem lead to political apathy among the young.
3971,At first I was surprised that New Zealand try to change national flag. That is because I didn't know that national flag can be changed. This is very serious problem because national flag is main identity for its country.I think Japanese flag should not change.
3972,I agree with you. This is very serious chance for New Zealand's independent history.New Zealand will be able to show the world that the country is a full-fledged independent country.
3981,"I have heard this news story before. So, when I finished reading this article, I wasn't surprised at this incident. I think that this problem is very difficult. In my opinion, to change the national flag doesn't mean complete independence. Because the most important thing for the complete independence is national's awareness. It makes no sense by a superficial change."
3988,"I strongly agree with your opinion!! Politician must not use political funding for self-interest. Today, many politician quite there job for scandals. Politician should be responsible for there action more."
3998,"Including this problem,court system in Japan has a lot of problem which could have been solved long time ago. However,before this case happening, we have not express this kind of problem and are not interested in it. What Japanese government has to do is start to solve these problems.Otherwise, there will be more victims like her."
3999,"Hearing this news, first, I could not what U2 wanted to do. Without doing such a fool thing, U2 is popular and a good band and I am one of U2's fan. Because of this free download ,u2 and apple got a lot of money ,I heard. It is very rude. I hope no artist does such a thing ,including U2. By the way I was also surprised that young people do not know U2."
4000,"I think that Yoichi Miyazawa went a sex club. However the problem is that he used office money for sex club. Including Yoichi Miyazawa ,some members of Japanese assembly lack consciousness of being member of it.Much more it is needless to say that a minister should have the consciousness and responsibility."
4001,"A national flag is seriously important for a country. This is because a national flag is one of identities for a country. Regarding this news ,I agree with New Zealand minister. However I want him to ponder which design of the flag is the best in that appropriateness. By the way ,I was very surprised to hear news because I have not think such a thing. But if Japan was colonized by other country and the country's marl embedded Japanese national flag, I would want to change the flag."
4003,"People have each own feelings about their national flags. Some have feelings of proud and honer. However, other don't so. In my opinion, it is natural that there is difference in feelings about national flags. I can understand what the minister want to say. He want to create 'original New Zealand national flag' by themselves. I think he wants to establish national identity by doing so. I think his thinking is good and to be respected. However, he shouldn't forget that many people have sworn , fought and been dead under the flag."
4004,"National flags show the nations' identity. So ,when a nation changes the national flag, the nation also changes their identity. People should be careful when it happens, and other country shouldn't touch it"
4009,"I believe this problem should not happen. However, I believe this lay judge system is good."
4010,"If I can get my favorite artist's album, I would be glad.However, U2 and Apple should not do that because it was rude thing. Their act made people who do not like U2 angry."
4012,"When I read this news, I felt so funny because Yoichi Miyazawa was too silly. To use office money for sex club is crazy thing and no one allow to do that. We can think easily that to use office money is not be allowed. So he should reflect that."
4016,I agree with you that we should observe offers' act.
4017,"When I heard this news, I was surprised because national flag changing is rare recently. Yet, I think it is better that New Zealand change their national flag because they are not the UK's colony now."
4022,I agree with you that it is good chance to change national flag of New Zealand. They are not colonized by England now.
4023,"I agree with you. If same things happen to me, I will not feel good too."
4024,I support the lay judge system too and I think the lay judge system will good influence.
4026,"I approve this idea. Because the recipient can touch new music for free of charge, people get new music for free of charge. So I estimate the idea very highly. It is true getting the music for the person who doesn't need is very troublesome. But it's a very lucky thing for a person who needs the music conversely. I have mistaken u2 for a virus. I want a preliminary report from the next!!!"
4043,"I think the lay judge system is good thing. It is because listening nation's opinion is good way to judge. But if I was chosen for lay judge member, I will become so nervous and be irresolute because I am afraid of seeing pictures of victims and the scene of the accident. So, I think that after care for the members is very important to defend there heart from depression."
4044,"I was surprised at this news because changing the nation flag is big incident. National flag express their country, so I think changing flag means changing country. New Zealand is going to remove the union jack from their flag and i think that it is natural trend."
4047,"I agree with you. I think it is wrong that only U2 is criticized because Apple made the system of free access. Also, It was good thing because people who do not know U2 can listen to their music easily."
4049,"I think so too. I do not want to change Japan's national flag. I also think the national flag is explaining our thought, history and our humanity. So I think that we do not need to change our flag and I think same thing as you."
4055,I think New Zealanders are proud of their flags but some of them are not pleased with the national flag with Union Jack. They love their flags and have various understandings.
4056,I agree with you too. This scandal is too shameful to be a politician. Japanese politicians must gain a people's confidence.
4057,I completely agree with you. I'm sad when I think how shocked U2's members were. I extend their sympathy to them.
4060,"I don't agree with you. Of course,U2 gave away his latest songs,but he got a lot of profit with Apple. U2 made some people happy,but more people were confused by what he did."
4066,"I agree with you.I don't know why such a fool person can get political serious position and I was disgusted by how Japanese politic does not work properly. If this situation continues, Japan will be damaged seriously."
4071,"I'm surprised that the Fukushima District Court has turned down a suit by the woman, Hifumi Aoki, who was claiming damages for stress of trial. I think government should guarantee that the person who agree to trial job is healthy."
4072,"I did not know this news so when I read this article, I was so surprised. It's terrible. However if I can download music freely, I would feel happy."
4073,"When I read this article, I'm surprised and feel ashamed. It is shameful that Japanese politicians quit their posts due to their scandal.I want politicians to do clean politics."
4074,I agree with you. I think Apple should have given users alternatives whether they downloaded the album or not.
4075,"I hadn't knew about real situation of acceptation of immigrants and asylum-seekers in Japan until I read this news and I felt astonished and so sorry. Certainly, refugees are usually held like criminals. Preventing that criminals enter Japan is policy of the government. However, It's wrong for sure to invade human rights. I think that attitude of Japan is invasion of human rights. I think PRAJ should care immigrants and asylum-seekers if it accept them at least."
4076,I am surprised that there are controversies about whether to change national flag took place. This problem depends on the way that New Zealand people think about their national flag. I want to watch New Zealand decision quietly.
4086,"I was surprised that the incident was occurred until quite recently because I never read such news. Though it is clear that a policy of immigration in Japan has been made slow progress, I didn't imagine that the circumstances was so severe. Japan is a nation which is exclusive to foreigners for a long time and the fact hasn't been improved much. Maintaining of national traits is good, but the government had better tolerate as much as possible."
4087,The embarrassing thing is that I had never known that asylum-seekers and refugees were in the strict situation until I read this article. I think the reason why Japanese society is indifferent to these people is that we can't imagine the necessity to accept them because Japan is an island country and we are never involved about refugee problems. Japanese society should make a regulation how we accept asylum-seekers and refugees and also have favorable attitude for them and never treat them like criminals.
4088,"I know that the correspondence to an emigrant is very severe situation in Japan. However, when I read this article, I felt that the situation was too terrible. All the human beings have human rights inherently. Not to mention it, it is not a thing applied to only a Japanese. As you can see, I think that it is not a permissible thing not to give a foreigner medical care. Japan should think about the acceptance of immigrants and asylum-seekers ."
4089,"I was surprised some problem like the article cause in Japan. The Japanese staff's attitude for detainees was bad. If a man suffer from pain , we should help for him regardless of nation. About Japan accepted only 6 refugees during the year, I think Japan accept more refugee flexibility. Because Japan has a problem about a declining number of children. That is worker will be decline. So I think immigrations help for Japanese work and economy.But I know one more aspect of problem of immigration is related to diplomacy. If Japanese government will think they are accepted, it is not easy. Although it is difficult Japan accepted refugee, Japanese people need to have more interest about the problem. In some country like the united states, people are easy to accept them ,as living many races. So , as the globalization is progressing in these days, people should have the sense of cooperation whether Japanese government accept more refugees or not."
4090,"When I read this article, I was frustrated by the government. Japanese society still permits human rights violations. And, Japanese government is too exclusive. Why don't they accept innocent people? At this rate, Japan would be isolated from the world. Emigrants are innocence personified.Cooperation on cross-border issues are government's obligations."
4094,"The Japanese government must notice a mistake. When I read this article, I was disappointed at the government. We have human rights equally. We should think seriously about this article. It is a natural action to help the person who is in trouble. Besides a country neglects medical care, and, therefore, it is a very big problem that a person dies. I cannot trust the Japanese Government which cannot protect even a human life under the monitoring. I thought that it was the article that should be reported more in Japan."
4098,"When I read this article, I was shocked. I think there is no racial discrimination in Japan. We should deal with all the people equally and of course we should remember how precious life is. Japan has high treatment techniques and reaches a high level of safety and development, so it is best for Japanese to be a good example."
4099,"When I read this news, I was ashamed of both Japanese society which take no attention to immigration system problem and ignorant myself. Japanese government should take responsibility of improving the circumstance of asylum seekers. However, as this article says, the hard present condition will have been continued, unless the people of Japan require the appropriate actions for asylum seekers from their own government and society. Nonetheless I think that most of Japanese people have not known this harsh environment of asylum seekers. This is because few news media have reported this problem. Therefore first of all, news media ought to cover this problem, and Japanese people including me should get more information about asylum seeker problem."
4108,"I didn't know that condition of support to immigrations is severe in Japan. I think it is too terrible. Not only Japanese but also all people in the world have human rights.Japanese government should think about the acceptance of immigrations and asylum-seekers,like European countries, USA and Canada accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year."
4109,"I was shocked when I read this article. I didn't know the actual condition of immigration center. Japan is often criticized that Japan's correspondence is slow. I sometimes feel so. But Europe and the U.S. is not always justice. This is very difficult problem. However, we respect for human lives."
4112,"When I read this article, I felt it is insincere that Japanese immigration detention center deal with immigrants. Immigrants are the same human-being as us, so we have to treat them fairly and considerately. Moreover Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts. I suggest that Japan should take in them more.This is because other advanced nation have been accepting more and accepting them would make decreasing Japan's labour improve."
4119,"I'm ashamed of the fact that Japan restricts the number of immigrants. It is unavoidable that people all over the world live together, so Japan should accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year following European countries, USA and Canada's example."
4121,"This news should be learned more by many Japanese.I was surprised by this news. It's because I didn't find a medical organization to a Japanese immigration insufficient.Japan is an image with a lot of gentle people and no discrimination.But actually there are many countries where an immigration is accepted than japan. I noticed that service to Japanese is enriched, but there is bad that the attitude to the foreigner. It's a shock news."
4126,"I was so shocked when I knew this news for the first time. What is particularly important is that this case happened in Japan, and it hasn't been treated as a serious issue in Japanese media. It is disgraceful news as one Japanese. I doubt Japanese government. I understand their measure not to accepts lots of immigrants. However it is wrong to deal life lightly, without concern. I hope that treats of immigrants would improve well."
4128,"I think Japanese are not familiar with foreign people. So we cannot accept them. Because Japan is a island country, we don't get used to be familiar with people whose backgrounds are completely different from that of us. And we don't hide our real thoughts that 'They are different.' So we cannot welcome them.But in the United States or EU, people can move across the border easily. So they can admit people who are not native to the land and are admitted by the other people. Especially, US is based on those who are offspring of immigrants or slaves. Therefore Americans fight with racism. As a result they have less prejudiced than they used to be. So they can accept people who are different from them. I think Japanese should learn from them a lot and be gentle with foreign people."
4132,"This news tells us how we Japanese are indifferent to immigration issues. According to the news passage, the Sri Lankan man was ignored when he had complained of chest pains and begged for a doctor to be called. The news says that immigration officials just moved him from a shared cell to a single cell, instead of taking care of him. I think it is no exaggeration that this behavior amounts to murder. Moreover, to my surprise, almost same cases were happened at another immigration center. I hope Japanese government takes this accidents very seriously, and take some measures in order not to happen again."
4133,We should be ashamed of this case! It will be said that Japan is tolerant of foreigners from all over the world. I think we should not accept many asylum seekers or immigrants but we must treat them very carefully. That is a duty of receivers. We never accepted asylum seekers if we could not deal with them appropriately.
4136,I agree your thoughts. We have been one nation in small islands for some centuries. Therefore we are not good at getting along with foreigners. It is hard for us to understand other cultures.
4137,"When I finished reading this article, I was very surprised. I haven't known this incident until now. Indeed, japan don't accept illegal immigration as this article says. However, even so, the fact won't be the reason that appropriate medical practice isn't given. I was disappointed at Japanese Government. A government has to reform a system immediately."
4138,"First, Japan must apologize to their relatives if Japan can know them.Second, Japanese government must take action to improve this situation.If this situation continues, Japan's confidence will be lost! We had better not so much feel not sorry for them but take action in order not to happen such a tragedy."
4142,I was also surprised at those two informations.However I do not agree your opinion that New Zealand must not change the national flag.This is because we do not know whether New Zealanders love the flag or not and it isn't probably good for them to include the Union flag in the national flag.
4145,"I will join the All Japan Model United Nations from 26th to 29th this month and discuss the problem of refugees, so I research about the world refugees' problems recently. I knew that Japan is novel in developed countries in that Japan accepts few refugees. As a Japanese, I am sad that Japan has little capacity and do not help people who seeks help, but I also think that there is a reason for that. That is because Japan is small in terms of the land. However, people who are in Japan should be taken medical care from us and we should keep humanity in us."
4146,"The article says that Japan restricts the immigration intake. Because Japan is an island nation,we sometimes display wariness over non-Japanese.We don't get used to non-Japanese. We have no intention of discriminating against immigrants .However,that is discrimination.Everyone has an indirect hand in discrimination. If you want to catch a criminal, you cannot discover the culprit. What are we to do in order to abolish discrimination? I do not know.What is even worse, I don't think that we can abolish discrimination completely. What is of paramount importance is that a commonplace person could have a part in discrimination."
4153,"I agree with your comment. Certainly immigrations will give good effect for our country's economy, but there is various problems not only as diploma but also as becoming a multiracial nation. If we advance a reception of refugees, the population will be aging and the birthrate declining extremely rapidly. But we have to considerate the reception cautiously."
4156,"I was so shocked when I heard this news for the first time. Important thing for the problem is that the news hasn't been treated as a serious problem in Japanese media. It is so bad. Japan should accepts many refugees and asylum seekers each year like USA,Japan should accepts tens of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers each year following European countries, USA and Canada's example."
4157,"Though I know many immigrants are treated unfairly, I don't think it is so cruel. In spite of such a severe situation, this news isn't told so much, which is problem. And strict restriction of immigration in Japan is also problem. If Japan continue restricting the number, immigrants accepted should be treated normally at least. If possible, more immigrants should be accepted."
4158,"I believed Japanese people are kind against all people before I read this article. However I know it is not true now. The fact written in the article is clearly a racial discrimination. I am sorry for Fernando and another people, and hope the world without any discrimination."
4159,"I felt really sorry and sad to read this news because in general, many foreigners say Japan is a good and comfortable place to stay. Needless to say, reaction of a detention center in Tokyo to foreigners was definitely improper. However, Japanese tightly restrictions on the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers should be considered separately, for small number of crimes of foreigners in Japan may be attributed to these restrictions."
4160,"When I read this article, I was very shocked and thought that this kind of problem was severe. This is because we have to think about 'racial equality' and according to the article, there are apparently discrimination. In Japan, the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts is very short so perhaps we have less opportunities to think about them than those in other countries. However, we found the fact that the problems related to immigration have already happened even in Japan!!!! This made me sad and disappointed. I think we must not draw a line, for example, between black and white. The biggest problem is that the Japanese society as a whole tends to be indifferent to the issue. When I watch news on TV or newspaper, many politicians talk about the economy and social welfare but not about the immigration. Nowadays, we live in the big global society and more and more people have the opportunity to meet foreigners in our daily lives. Therefore, I think we should consider 'how we have to behave' toward them."
4166,"I really agree with this comment because I also think that this kind of immigration problem is related to our economy and our big problem, the shortage of the number of children. This means, if we accept more immigrants and asylum-seekers, we can make the situation which needs more workers better than now. I have one simple question. Why do we usually discuss the economic problem without considering about immigrants? As the article says, we are likely to feel indifferent to the immigrants and asylum-seekers, but we should connect them with our economy. We need more and more young workers in a big aging society, so we all have to reconsider about this matter again."
4167,"This problem is not only the problem of immigration center,but also our country's problem.It's said that Japanese country treat refugees very strictly .and I think so.I think we should accept foreigners more widely. Because of this,we gain some merits. For example,we are able to gain the work force of country. And we are able to promote globalization more and more."
4171,"I agree with your opinion. I also feel that the Japanese policy for refugees is too severe. And it leads to human rights violations. However, we will not change a policy by this matter immediately as an opportunity because the policy for refugees is always a fixed thing. Therefore, I think that the Japanese Government does not change a policy at a stretch, but should change from overall consciousness in Japan. This is important as problem in the future of Japan."
4181,"I disagree with your opinion. Changing a national flag is a big problem for the country because a national flag strongly symbolizes a nation. Even though its flag contains a part of the national flag of UK, to have own original flag is very important for an independent country, I think."
4182,"I strongly agree with your opinion. As long as they politicians get a lot of money as a salary which is mostly composed of our tax, they have to work hard and must not do improper things which look strange from citizens' viewpoint."
4188,"I think there are 2 problems about this news. First, immigration center is faced a shortage of doctors. Fernand had complained of chest pains and begged for a doctor to be called, but quick response wasn't performed in this case. This is seriously human rights problem. Second, Independent inspection panels should be in place in an appropriate manner in immigration center. If immigration control office personnel are kept under surveillance, they can't threatening or violent behavior. Immigration center like a closed society, it is dangerous."
4191,"I approve your opinion. Japanese government should tolerate immigration and asylum seekers. Even if the government will have continued the strict immigration policy, they should take responsibility for the human rights of immigration. Also I think they should report the condition of immigrant in Japan to their nation."
4195,"I'm interested in your opinion. Certainly, Japan is a island country. So may be we are not get used to getting along with foreign people. But at least we must regard of human rights."
4198,"I really agree with you. This news should be known to everyone, especially to Japanese. Then, we have to take it as a serious problem and deal with it. I want to have more pride in my home country than now to improve problems like this."
4199,"I did not know this news in detail, but was shocked very much when I read. Surely,the person who is accommodated was taken some kind of a crime, but I think that the human rights should be protected. The medical care is not received when taken and I think that it cannot be said that human rights are protected in the life in the prison. In addition, I think that it may become the cause that our country lower the evaluation from the overseas countries when such a case happens in Japan. Therefore I think that the issue of such human rights wants you to argue carefully."
4202,"Your proposals are very precise. If we accept foreigners more widely, we are patient with foreigners. In the end, I wish we rid of segregation in Japan."
4208,"After I read this article, I was very surprised that there is still racial prejudice in Japan. So, I think we have to change this thought and improve the system of immigration. Honestly, I didn't know there is racial discrimination in Japan. We students may have learned that there is still prejudice against immigrants, but haven't learned that in our country. So, in the future, Japanese people, not only children or students but also adults should get a chance to know these problem. And then, we could think about solution or improvement of this immigration system, I think."
4209,"I think so too. I have never heard news of such things. So, first, we Japanese people should know this problem."
4216,"Reading this article,I felt the darkness of the Japanese administration.It is one of the very dire cases I've ever heard.May be so far, many people have wanted to change the system,but they haven't.According to prospect theory created by Daniel and amos in1979 ,human beings innately make much of or fears losses than earning.So many people think the case terrible but they may not act.Cause if they act,the thing which people can lose is much larger than the thing they get,I think.this is an armchair theory .But if the present situation were to continue,dire situation like this won't change forever.It isn't too much to say that it is dereliction f duty.Thus politicians should immediately take measure ."
4217,"This terrible incident shows the Japan's indifference to immigrants. Our country's immigration policy is rather strict, which unfortunately makes us blind to the fact that such discrimination to those from foreign countries often occur. This is, in a way, something unavoidable in a homogeneous society like Japan. Since there are little immigrants around us, we do not and cannot pay much attention to this kind of issues. Nevertheless, we have to shift such attitudes, aside whether Japan should change the policy or not. What is important in our society today is to share these cases with many other people to realize the situation."
4218,"I generally agree with you. As you said, it is important to 'change the present situation'. But our indifference stems from something very deep and underlying: Japan is an Island nation that have historically been able to be away from foreign country and systems and that have kept its homogeneous nature. It would be very difficult to change that attitude in a blink thorough taking measures, because there are still many Japanese politicians and officers who are ignorant about this issue. So I prefer to say that, first of all, we citizen should 'understand the present situation' to make our society better."
4220,"I already known about the matter about immigration in Japan. How few the number of immigrants is! Japan should increase the number. It is too small, compared with European countries. Japan faces an aging society with a low birthrate. Accordingly, more and more people who can work will need. Thus Japan will accepts more refugees and immigrants."
4223,"I think your notion of japan is a little bit idealistic.Of course it is true that Japan has higher technology than other countries,but Japan has invisible dangerous too.The dangerous is discrimination.A wise man once said good medicines suffering in mouth.Thus that dangerous sometimes become merit.In my opinion,if it were not for discrimination,it is no exaggeration to say that human and nation may become dysfunctional."
4244,"I sympathize with your opinion. I was disappointed at Japanese correspondence, too. And medical care system in a prison to a Japanese foreigner can't be trusted. It's a big problem that it wasn't reported at all in Japan. Japan seemed going to hide an inconvenient part from me. I think that we seem to discriminate against a foreigner over the unconsciousness. But a foreigner is also the same man at the Japanese inside. The development of legislation for foreigner's human rights to be secured will be needed immediately."
4256,"It is good idea that not only students but also adults should get a chance to know the problem. Before reading the article, I don't know the problem. In my opinion, we should accept more immigrants. Because immigrants help for Japanese economy under declining number of children. But I know accepting immigrations is not so easy and simple problem. Therefore we should think and talk about the problem as you said."
4262,"I agree with your opinion. I am proud of Japanese, but this case makes me sad. Japanese media should more pick up like this news. We have to think that this news is important to be connected with each other about a life."
4269,"I didn't know about this news in detail, but it was shocked very much when I read this article. The person who is accommodated was taken crime, but I think that the human rights should be protected perfectly. I was surprised some problem like the article cause in Japan too. The Japanese staff's attitude for detainees was very bad. If a man suffer from pain, we should help for him regardless of nation."
4286,"I was really surprised when I read this article,and I was sad that cruel accident like this happened in Japan. I cannot understand why immigration officials did not call a doctor when Nickeles Fernando complained about severe chest pain. If they called a doctor as soon as he complained about severe chest pain, he might escape death. They must should have called a doctor. I wish that cruel accident like this will not happen again."
4297,"When Read this article, I was really shocked and surprised because I had thought Japan had better immigration system. Labour union official Toru Sekimoto said this problem caused partly because Japanese society as a whole is indifferent to this issue and I agree with this opinion. I think if this bad correspondence to immigrants didn't change in the future, Japan would lose confidence in international society, so we have to have more interest in this issue."
4299,"I was surprised how poor the environment for asylum-seekers in Japan. Though the admission many refugees will cause the same case at care home in Japan,we must accept them more because we must respect the other's right regardless of race."
4300,"I agree with you. I think how this problem will be resolved will be not only internal problem but also eternal,namely,international problem. thus we must try to increase the number of acceptation of asylum-seekers."
4332,"From this article, we can know that Japanese immigration policy and the quality of it is not enough though Japan is a developed country. I think many people will be depressed when they know this situation. And they shout like this ' Japanese government think much of this situation and we should accept more immigrants.' without thinking. Although they are right in some point, I don't think so. Accepting many immigrants will cause some problem such as increasing poverty , disorder. Respecting ones right is very important, however, we should consider the core of problem."
4358,I agree with you. More immigrants should be permitted to work in Japan. I wonder why Japan restrict it such. I hope global place of work realize.
4366,"I think that there are not many sociable people in Japan. It is because that Japan is an island country. In other words, there are not opportunities to interact with foreigner. Being familiar with foreigner is the most important problem to be solved to advance the global society. I believe that such a incident will happen never."
4369,"I was very surprised that such incidents are often occurred in Japan. And I think immigration officials should treat the immigrants who came to Japan more carefully. Because their heartless correspondence made a Sri Lanka detainee kill in this case. Furthermore it's the first time to hear that Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants and asylum-seekers it accepts. I don't know this is good or bad for us. but if it is duty as advanced nations to accept more immigrants, Japan should do it, I think."
4375,"I was shocked to read this article. Japanese does not want to pay attention to immigrants so much, and accept. So, we must have more interests in this problem. I think it relates Japan to island in the sea and we are not familiar with those who settle in Japan. Sp we should have more knowledge about those people,and work on together government."
4381,"I was disappointed at this news. In Japanese education, teachers say 'you must not discriminate against all the livings.', but this case happened in Japan. I think education in Japan didn't influence people's way of thinking because we didn't experience commune between us and foreigners. So we should have opportunity to interact them."
4386,"I was so shocked when I was read the news.We should remember that our lives are important whether the racial is. I think it is too serious situation that Japanese society is indifferent to the issue though medical care in Japan's immigration system has long been a problem. Also, I think that Japan should receive the refugees and asylum seekers more.It is true that there will be many problems because of doing it and it will take a lot of time to arrange the system. However, it is the duty for the developed countries to cooperate the developing countries."
4390,"I agree with the changing the flag's design to one that better to reflect the country's status as a modern, independent nation. If changing the flag's design made the union of the nation, it is so nice. It is natural that as the history passes longer, the situation or status of the nation changes.So,I agree with the changing national flag based on persuasive reason. I wonder if that Japan's flag will change in the future....."
4403,"I was so disappointed with the news.Also I was disgusted at Japanese politicians because the incidents like this often occur these days.I want to remember the politicians to their pride that they felt when they started so important occupation for all the nation.Also, we should not only criticize the politicians but also participate in the politics."
4406,"I didn't know the news before I read this in this class.However,I am the iTunes user, so I am interested in the detail.Also, It was possible that I was drawn this problem actually. Now, the iTunes users are increasing in the world.In this case,the album was distributed for free.I think that iTunes should make the rule secure."
4416,I was so shocked when I read this news story because one men was dead only because he was an immigrant. I was so sad. I also surprised at the number of immigrants Japan accepts each year. Japan accepted only six refugees during the year. It is so few. I think that We should help each other as same human.
4418,I strongly agree with your opinion. It is shameful trend of Japan accepting few immigrants or asylum-seekers. Japanese should know this issue and we must accept more immigrants and asylum-seekers.
4426,"I was ashamed that I haven't know the fact until I read the article,too.I strongly agree with your opinion ,the reason why the society in Japan is not interested in asylum-seekers and refugees is we don't have opportunity to feel the necessity to accept them because Japan is an island country and we are never involved about refugee problems.It is relevant observation I think.All we have to have understanding about this problem."
4429,I agree with your opinion. I think Japan's attitude to immigration is the one like to criminal too.
4431,"I think we have to accept and think very seriously about the news, because it takes part in human right issues. I was very shocked when I read the news, because I believed Japan was relatively tolerant toward every foreign people. Now we have to look again and amend our immigration system, and our view to human rights."
4441,"I agree with your opinion. I also think we should make more constructive system for immigrants as soon as possible. To realize it, we all Japanese people should take a grip on the reality of immigrants for the first step."
4445,"I agree with your opinion. When I read this article, I had shocked too. I could not believe that cruel accident like this happened in Japan. I want the Japanese Government to work out a countermeasure for this problem."
4447,"I personally think that Japanese government should rethink the attitude toward foreign people who live in Japan. If Japan did not do that, other country might look down on Japan as unethical and inhuman country."
4451,"I was so shocked when I read this article and I didn't know that. I wonder that media didn't publish such a terrible incident. I think Japanese people have tolerant mind,so I cannot understand this news. We have to know a sloppy accept system and approve accepting asylum seekers."
4454,"This is really shameful attitude and act in the international society today. Even if they are refugees or immigrants,Japanese should pay more attention to the asylum for refugees and the human right problem.Japan should be a nation of protection of minorities I think."
4465,I agree with your opinion.Japan tightly restricts the number of immigrants it accepts. I think that Japan should take in them more.
4470,"Human rights of a foreigner in Japan are secured in Japan. So such event make me shock very much. Medical technology is advancing Japan, but there is a difference in the rich and poor between the patient. It's necessary to have many people know such news for all people who live in Japan to receive equal medical treatment."
4478,"I completely agree with your opinion. Personally, I think Japan don't have to accept asylum seekers actively, but we might have to do so in some situations, because of humanitarian consideration. This case tells all over the world that we Japanese don't have such humanitarian point of view. In the global society, which ask for international cooperation, this label will bother us. I hope that the authorities regret the case and improve the condition of asylum seekers."
4484,"I think so, too. We should consider how to overcome our mentalities. After that we can truly welcome foreign people."
4485,"I think so, too. People in New Zealand should take a long time and consider not just the design of the national flag but also their past and future seriously."
4490,"This incident made me heavy.The topic whether the Japanese Government should or should not accept immigrants is a completely different problem. No matter who it is, even if it were to be an immigrant, isn't helping a person whose life is in danger the right thing to do? I wish that such a incident like this will never happen ."
4493,"Being look down on Japan as unethical and inhuman country is very scary for Japan. So, I strongly think that Japanese government must decide to take measures. as soon as possible."
4504,I agree with your opinion that it is a too difficult problem to change flags. There are big conflict between the pride of independent and the international relationship.
4505,I relate to your idea that it is the duty for the developed countries to cooperate with the developing countries. Developed countries should receive more refugees and asylum-seekers even if that is the case we have to arrange our systems.
4518,I was so surprised this news and I thought we should think this problem more seriously. And I thought Japan should accepts many refugees and asylum seekers each year like USA.
4524,I was frustrated too. I believed that Japan respects human rights. So I was so sad when I heard this news.
4527,"I was surprised because I didn't know this news. Every people who has various background is equal and we must not discriminate every people according to their colors of skin, radical difference and nationality. Japan is inferior to other countries in the matter of nationality. We must solve this problem as soon as possible."
4536,"Nowadays, reception of immigrants is very serious problem around the world. Considering this news, Japan should expand right of immigrants.But given other countries' situations, there will be a lot of oppositions. So immigration problem is needed to be treated cautiously."
4539,I agree with you. Japan has advanced medical technology.But It is so bad that Japan doesn't exploit this technology. We should know these problem then.
4546,"I feel so terrible. If Japan might be attacked by North Korea with rocket, I couldn't sleep easily. I want to be peace."
4547,"Seeing this news article, I was surprised other countries regard the ANC as terrorist. Nelson Mandela was one of the politicians in 20century. We never forget his achievement and apartheid. I believe that all people in the world should think about racial discrimination."
4548,Finding new things about sleeping is tremendously important because human beings spend 1/3 of their life sleeping.
4549,"I was kind of aware that the song which I never had bought was on my iTunes. I don't think that is the bad idea to put their music on everyone's iTunes account automatically, but they should have given us the options.In that way everybody could have been so happy."
4558,"I agree with President Obama's idea that same-sex couples should be able to wed. We can't have right to deprive them of their happiness. Banning gay marriage leads to discrimination, which will violate human rights. It's sacrosanct in nature. We, our society, should admit diversity of values. As the Japanese proverb 'so many men, so many minds' show, I believe there is no officially decided way to love others."
4562,"I think this article shows a serious problem in Japan and is related to all of us. The more elderly people is increased, the more responsibilities we must have. Thus, if elderly people wants a job, government should help them to seek a job and solve a problem with entire country. This situation will not be changed if there are no help of the government."
4564,I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.
4565,"I think this is very serious problem.The number of people aged 65 is increasing these days.So young people has many serious problems about tax and care for the aged.I think a solution to this problems is increase the number of children.To increase it, we should make an environment which easy to give birth.And the government should make a policy. Probably it will take many time.But I think someday the number will increase. I'm worry about Japan' future very much.we should do something to solution this problem."
4566,"I had known that older people in Japan was increasing, but I didn't imagine that it would reach 40% in 2060. I think that Japanese government should immediately make a policy which companies must hire motivated older people. Also, it must act for young people. Reducing public debt, they don't need to be afraid of their future and can happily think about having their babies. I hope Japanese economy will recover as soon as possible."
4568,"It is lucky that nobody got injured this time,but if the North Korea restart testing nuclear weapon we have to be aware of them always.That means we will have to carry so much stress in our life.Needless to say that's not the way people live,so we have to solve the problem immediately."
4573,"I was so glad to hear this news.Because I like 'washoku' very much.I think 'washoku' is very healthy and delicious.Perhaps,almost all Japanese like 'washoku'.I think many people all over the world heard this news and they were interested in Japanese traditional food 'washoku'.I would like them to know taste of 'washoku'.And I would like them to be interested in other Japanese culture."
4574,"I was surprised with the fact that two referendums are hold to decide a flag design, and was impressed with the way how people are thinking carefully about its national pride. This is a good chance for me to reconsider of my own identity. Japan is an island country which has never experienced being colonized and which has decided to not to have a war again. The Japanese flag is always there and nobody doubts it will change. However, it does not mean we do not have to know the meaning of our national flag design, Japanese history, politics, economics and so on. I think Japanese are too unconcern for our mother country. By reading and knowing what is happening and how people is struggling with its history even now, I could recognize myself not doing anything to know Japan and I appreciate for this opportunity."
4577,I think this is one of the most important problem in Japan. Aging population and decreasing number of children will cause declining economy power. And young people will have to hold heavy tax for pensions. We should think how we create the society that the aged can keep to work and many family can get some baby. Young people have to save money for life in their old age because they will be able not to receive pensions.
4578,"An aging society is big problem for Japanese society. I think two plans. We have to make our society very convenient for elderly people. And we should conduct the employment adjustment. And I think the Japanese government have to think about accepting immigration. In the future,we have to cooperate with the immigration. Though if the immigration increases,the friction will increases. But for the Japanese future we should accept the immigration and cooperate with them."
4582,"I think writing kanji characters correctly is an evidence of being a good-educated adult. So, this trend must be taken seriously. Of course, it is true that computers or mobile phone are essential for communication these days. But words are transformed predicatively and automatically by these tools. All we have to do is type in their alphabet. If people rely on this function too much, they will stop writing kanji with their own hand and thinking of how to write them. The young, especially university students, should write their paper without using computers once in a while."
4583,"I think present Japanese system is not good.This system leads people to wrong direction.Immigrants and asylum-seekers now being regarded as nothing. This situation may lead immigrants worse position. So,PRAJ should care immigrants and asylum-seekers if accept them."
4586,"It's very difficult problem to solve in Japan, but I think same-sex couples should be able to get married, or we should establish a alternative system like a marriage. For example, a same-sex couple held a wedding ceremony at Tokyo Disney Resort. It's symbolic event. Marriage between people of the same gender or civil union win public recognition gradually. So we should have interest in this problem and protect their legitimate rights."
4588,"North Korea should realize that they have been accused of their action by many countries.And,they are received an economic sanction,so they should refrain from provocative behavior.But,we can not solve the problems only by sanction. We have to negotiate with them positively."
4596,"This is a very very famous topic.Why?Because,we often look the TV news about illegally downlords.However,Why don't illegally downloads disappear?Human would like to do that they want to do.I think that it is difficult that illegally downloads disappear."
4604,"I was surprised at the news of changing the national flag.At first, I thought there was no need of doing it,but I realized that the national flag meant their identity and so on.Considering it, I thought New Zealanders should make their unique flag. Even if they can not change it this time, this argument will be the good chance of recognizing their uniqueness."
4605,"I think this is a very complicated problem. In Japan, as the birthrate declines and the population ages, the population of people aged 65 or over is increasing. So Japan's social power may decline because there will be more old people who spend on social security than young people who participate social economic activities. However, long life is our dream. From these reasons, I think this problem is very complicated. Then, I think we should consider two problems that young people these days put of starting families and they have few children than before. A declining birthrate and aging population is not only our problem but also our future's problem, so I think it is important to consider deeply and live having consciousness that we are the member of our society."
4609,"This news is very hot one for me. One day, when I listened to my music in my usual way, the unknown song started suddenly. I thought my iPhone was corrupted at that time. Certainly, like many people, I griped at consuming iPhone's storage without my permission and U2's arrogant action. But the just thing made my feeling bad is what Apple can make our iPhones downloaded things automatically. I want Apple not to do such a thing from now on."
4615,"The tough point of this news is that whether we put emphasis on either history or national feelings. In my opinion, they shouldn't change their flag because history is a pile of various thing. They should accept their past which they are ruled by UK and embrace both good and bad aspects. And also, we shouldn't see one side. Having a wide view is important."
4622,"I am surprised to hear this news because I have never heard that national flag can change. If I were New Zealand people, I wouldn't change national flag. I imagine they love their flag which they watched when they were child."
4624,"The idea that they're admitted to be equivalent to marriage and they can receive a certificate was approved at Shibuya last month. We can think better about sexual minority's rights to hear this news. But there're still many people thinking bad against them. So I think that we should solve this problem gradually,not radically."
4626,"When I read this article,I was angry.I hope women became to work equally in Japan."
4628,I think this problem is very serious.I think Japan government should change system about elderly.
4630,"I'm proud of him as the same Japanese. In Japan, the aging society is regard as one of the serious problems and it is needed to encourage the aged to contribute the domestic production over a long period. I think his great achievement succeeded in inspiring the aged to act positively. He told us that we can realize our dreams, regardless of our own age. I want to pursue my goal even if there are some difficulties like him."
4631,"We have something to do with this serious problem. We must support a lot of people aged 65 until retire from our own job. In addition, there is no sure proof that I can get pension for declining birth rate. I think this problem is too complicated for Japan's government to solve."
4632,We do not never do war. Even if we are attacked by rocket launch which made in North Korea. Because we know it's terrible to do war by our experiences. So we should talk to them and find peaceful resolution.
4634,"The young give up having babies because of the current environment. First, it is recession.Since the young are worried about their income, they are unwilling to have babies. Second,it is about child-care leave. Since it is difficult for them to get a job again, they tend not to have babies. As the population of aging people increase, the young have responsibility to support aging people. I think that government should control the surroundings to increase the population of the young."
4640,I agree with this opinion. Akihiro Suzuki must always take a right action as a representative of the nation. But he has take the bad action. He should think about the action that he took and reflection deeply one more.
4641,"I think that the Japanese culture of writing kanji has to be maintained and we should teach it to our children and grandchild not to pass away it. Nowadays,one of the educational policies promoted by Japanese government is that the introduction of positive English lessons make Japanese children good English speakers. Certainly,it is so important to study and master English since children are little in the world having become globalization. But I think it is not so good that the longer time they spend studying English, the shorter time they spend writing and reading kanji. That is because using kanji is able to express various emotions. I hope to continue the culture in the future."
4642,"It is important to think about the World War II. But we must think about it. There are a lot of opinions on the premise that it is not again cause the war. For example, Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution say that it does not have any forces. What is the force? Is 'Jieitai' the force? I don't know because the Constitution does not specify. So I think the government should establish the definition of neatly forces in provisions rather than the interpretation."
4647,"I feel relieved to hear the news that the launch failed.Also I think we have to be a good terms with North Korea.If North Korea has hostility for us, North Korea may try to fire the rocket again."
4652,I think this problem is one of the most important issues in Japan. Japanese government should take steps. Otherwise Japan cannot grow any more.
4653,"I am sure that politicians' funds must be managed carefully.Many politicians receive money from their party for political activities and their party receive money from the government funds. The government funds are composed of national debt and taxes on the nation.Therefore,many politicians receive money from citizens indirectly. In conclusion, politicians' funds are equal to nations' money and it is essential to be managed carefully."
4657,"I think the fact which aging people increasing will be not changed and the fact will serious influence on Japanese economy. Even if aging people or retiree can get an opportunity to work, their productivity will be low. But I think Japan will have to depend on the work force of the elderly because of the declining birthrate."
4659,"When I read this story, I realized we didn't know what the war exactly was. At the same time, I learned the importance of the real story from people who overcame the war.I think Japanese government ignore opinions local people have.Japanese education curriculum Abe tries to make is too conservative.We should learn World WarⅡhistory from various perspective."
4663,"I think that Asian countries around North Korea should impose sanctions on that country . As it is, North Korea repeat rocket launch."
4668,"Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. If we pratical-ize this technology, the number of car accidents and traffic fatalities will decrease. However, we will have one trouble. It is to increase driving without a license."
4670,"Autonomous car was imaginary technology when I was a child. But now,the fantasy is realizing and we can see the car moving with AI through the Internet.Today's advance of technology is very fast and some people are enjoying such situation,but others are struggling to catch up with it. I think that to consider problems that this current of the times may cause is important today."
4671,"This news's opinion is that the society is a way of thinking to let elderly to account work. As a result of this news, I thought that I must give job opportunities in more elderly to account. This problem is very serious and is the problem that should be settled."
4674,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was shocked because I did not know that there is a lot of problems about the immigrants in Japan. I think there is big problem with respect to this news.It is that it was not to have been able to save the life that they should have been able to save.They should have helped him whether a patient was an immigrant.We must do immediately to deal with this problem so that the same trouble will never it."
4678,"I agree with the election. If there are some opinions, it is necessary to ask the public opinion. Because problems concerning patriotism or nationalism like this are really important for the people lives in the country. When it is decided the changing, I hope New Zealanders are pleasant with the new design and proud of the new flag."
4680,"The aging of Japan is remarkable, so I think that Japanese government should take measures. Especially I think think that Japanese government should hold a retirement age in particular because it contributes that debts of Japan of increase that people paying a tax decrease."
4682,"Similar cases occur frequently in Japan. For example, an Iranian man dead in March 29, 2014 and a Myanmarese man dead in October 14, 2013 at immigration facilities. Japan should change correspondence immediately to prevent immigration center from increasing victims."
4683,"I think this is a difficult problem, and Japanese government should consider it more serious. People can find meaning in life by working. People can feel pleasure and make friends by working. So if a retired person wants to work, a country should give him job opportunities . Nowadays, the population of young people is decreased. We shouldn't forget our society is supported by elderly people."
4684,"This technology is very amazing. The number of fatalities will be decreased by this technology. But in other words, employment opportunities will be also decreased . Track driver,taxi driver,bus driver and etc will be not able to work. Therefore new employment must be given to them while this technology is introduced."
4685,"When I read it ,I was so excited because I watched autonomous cars in picture books or animation in my childhood. It is a dreamlike technology!! Most of the traffic accidents in the world are caused by not malfunction of cars but carelessness of people. Practical use of autonomous cars may change this situations. In addition, traffic jams can be eased, we can reduce consumption of the gasoline. However, we have some problems about autonomous cars, so we should examine them carefully."
4686,"The problem is very serious. Elderly people want to find a new job now. But they cannot. So, we should give them a chance of reemployment. Concretely, our government must help them to get it. Therefore, the problem of economy will recover."
4687,"When I read the headline of this article for the first time, I was fearful about the spread of self-driving cars, because I think many problems will be found after they begin to be used. Certainly, autonomous cars may help to reduce traffic fatalities, but if we really want to reduce traffic accidents, we have to utilize public transports, for example, trains and buses. They are safe, more economical, and environment-friendly. we are likely to be interested in the new scientific technique. However, we should give it more careful consideration."
4688,"I think self-driving cars are worth of being put into practice in terms of a decrease in traffic accident and a relaxation of congestion. However, the cars may not work depending on the circumstances perfectly. This system without judgements by us can cause tragic accidents. In addition, this technology will deprive people who like to drive of pleasures of driving. So, I don't think self-driving cars should replace all human-driving cars."
4689,"First, I did not have any images that Google is making a car, so felt a sense of incongruity with seeing the word Google with other names like Mercedes-Benz. After reading and trying to imagine the future written in this article, I am scared because worse things might happen. The scale of an accident is unpredictable. But at the same time, I understand how convenient it is. I hope the use of existing-driving cars and autonomous cars will properly be balanced."
4690,I feel that this problem is very serious and Japanese government must think the way to revitalize Japanese economic more. And I think its government had better give an opportunity for job to aging people who want to work because it is not absolute that labor force of aging people is inferior to that of young people.
4693,"I tend to stay up late, so I think I should go to bed earlier for brain to work essentially."
4694,"I think this problem is so serious. Not only Japanese government but also we ourselves must give this problem more careful consideration. We are involved in this matter. First of all, in order to solve this problem, we have reconsider about a tendency to marry later. It can bring about a declining birthrate. Young people tend to think that it is not easy to marry and bring up children. It is partly because of unfavorable employment conditions. We have to improve labor conditions. Secondary, we have to suggest new type of company or job that elderly people can easily work for. For example, I think that elderly women can work as baby-sitters because most of them has an experience of child care when they were young mother. As stated above, we can do a lot of things to solve this problem."
4695,"I think this problem is very difficult. Some older people can work more, but other people cannot do it because of illness and so on. My grandmother lives on a pension,and she doesn't work. I have never think of her working more,and,to tell the truth, I hope she doesn't do. But,their annuity is covered by our tax! I don't want to work them, but young people are decreasing.It is really serious problem."
4696,Aging problem is serious in japan now. Elderly people is increasing. I think working problem is the most difficult. What elderly people need is the measures to those who can work and who cannot work because of their illness.
4697,"When I read this article, I think that this invention is very exciting and helpful. It helps many people who cannot drive because of physical disabilities to go far place. However, at the same time, I think that we need a preparation of laws. For example, we need to clarify who would be responsible for, if a car which is automatically driven broke something or got involved in any troubles."
4698,"When I read this article, I thought this problem was very serious and it had to do with medical development and improving the health service. This is very difficult problem s. Those developments are of course needed by everyone. Nobody wouldn't like to live. However, it will cost government to continue them. Also young people will have to pay more tax. We should consider what we do."
4699,"I think aging problem is very serious because the burden on each young person will increase more and more in terms of the pension, the insurance and some kinds of tax which are used for elderly people. It means decline of Japanese economy that young people supporting the economy are pressed."
4702,"I think it is a good idea to use self-driving car because it has a lot of benefits such as declining traffic accident. But I don't want to use this car in the future. Although it has a lot of benefits, there is no prove that self-driving car run safely all the time. I fear that the car may run sometimes without consideration for other cars or pedestrians. Thus, I want to use existing car even if Google let the self-driving car into the market."
4703,"I think it is really useful if the car move automatically, but I disagree with this opinion. If the big traffic accident happened between autonomous driving cars, nobody can be responsible and police cannot arrest anyone. It will make a lawless zone."
4704,"I think the technology of self-driving cars is fantastic and people all over the world may be interested in this topic. Yet I have two questions. One is that traffic accidents will really decline in the future. Even if self-driving cars are correctly controlled by computer, computer power is not necessarily perfect. The other is that driving licence is need or not. This is why I disagree self-driving plan."
4705,"I think that this aging problem in Japan is so serious. The government of Japan values the elderly people's lives , but don't help young people. I suppose that Japanese government should assist young people more than elderly people , because the young have the future."
4706,"I think that self-driving is good idea , but I disagree to use the technology of autonomous driving too much. There are three reasons. First, if the car lose the energy to operate itself, it might be in danger situation. Second, there is no guarantee that self-driving cars will never cause accidents. Third, automotive cars occurs the difficulty of finding employment, because the drivers won't be in needs. To sum up, I suppose that there are several problems to use automobile cars."
4707,I think self-driving car is a good invention but I would not completely agree with that we use self-driving cars in ordinarily. I have heard that auto-pilot sometimes be a cause of plane accidents;Automatic pilot is hard to be cancel. So human pilot can't do best drive. I think it will happen in the case of self-driving car. Human assessment of situations is better than machine particular in the exceptionally cases. I command people's driving. Now we have not to up to machine and rethink about human's faculty.
4708,"I am very excited to read the article and I am looking forward to autonomous driving coming.If autonomous cars can be used , our life will be rich and we don't have to have driving license. However there are some problem.According to the article , we has not secured their safety yet,so traffic accidents can happen like now.Also,we need make a new law about them because traffic system will change. When we trust in their safety, we would like to utilize them positively."
4709,"Self-driving cars are interesting and very useful. If we can use these cars, we will be able to drive with no driving license. This article said that self-driving cars are going to save millions of lives. However, I think they will have as many accidents as now because they can't do depending on the circumstances. So, when we use self-driving cars, we have to be more carefully to drive all the time. I think we will also have to get driving license to drive the cars in the future."
4710,"At first, I was surprised that self-driving vehicles would spread around the world in the near future. Also, I didn't know that Google contributes the society of autonomous vehicles. To my surprise, the technology is not dream but reality so I think that it is not far away that we can go to space easily and cars can fly. I realized that one original action of a corporation can move world's market. In addition, I was shocked that traffic accidents kill more one million people a year. Self-driving cars will not only make our lives very convenient but also save them so I wish the immediately expanding of self-driving cars."
4711,"When I read this article, I was surprised because I have thought that Google was the company of computers. If autonomous cars become the mainstream of automobile industry, the number of unexpected accidents will reduce and we can go everywhere without driver's license. However, I think it is not good to rely on the machine too much. If autonomous cars prevail in the world, we should be careful of accident while driving. And also, I have a question. If we can utilize autonomous cars without driver's license, can children drive autonomous cars? I think autonomous cars have many benefits, but they also have many problems. I would like to expect more advances of automobile industry."
4712,"It is true that some people say that autonomous cars are beneficial and useful for us. However I think we should deal with danger of using self-driving cars. For example, the government should enact a law that regulates the use of autonomous cars to some degree. And I expect that technology will improve."
4713,"I was surprised that Google was inventing the self-driving cars. That's because Google is famous for searching system. However, I'm excited this new technology. If self-driving cars become main type of cars, we may drive a car without any license. That is an epoch-making invention."
4714,I was surprised that Google is inventing not only computers but also cars.I think self-driving cars will be very convenient for drivers.Because they don't have to pay attention to driving.And everyone can drive cars without licenses.That is very wonderful.But I am worried about the increasing of the number of traffic accidents.I was surprised that traffic accidents kill 1.2 million people worldwide a year now.The evolution of this technology is great.But we must give priority to the safety of people.
4715,"I was surprised at the idea of self-driving cars. It is indeed wonderful that number of traffic accident would become zero by technologies of self-driving cars. However, I suppose that self-driving cars are hard to realize, because there are some difficulties to realize, such as traffic rules among the world. Despite it, I would be happy if Japanese automakers will contribute realizing of the car."
4716,"I think that self-driving vehicles are the revolution of the automobile industry. I was impressed by the news.However, I am worried about the vehicles. Because I can't imagine and feel a sense of incongruity about not driving a car by oneself. Though Automotive Engineers make an effort to improve the vehicles,there is the limit of the machine.Even if self-driving vehicles appear in the market, I will choose conventional ones."
4717,"When I read this article, I think the technology of self-driving cars is very amazing and useful. I cannot believe we may not need to take our driving licenses in the future! However,I suppose that it is not good to overestimate too much of this technology. We must not forget that a car is a dangerous vehicle that easily takes a person's life. The government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars."
4718,"I've heard about self-driving cars before but I wasn't able to believe that they would come true, so I'm very surprised to read this article and realize the rapid technology innovation. I think self-driving cars is very useful because people who are drunk can 'drive' and we don't come to be serious about drunk driving. In addition, we can 'drive' anything even if we are injured, in poor health and sleepy. As Ray Kurzweil said, however, if an autonomous car may cause an accident, it would be big news so we should consider the demerits. In my opinion, we shouldn't let young children drive. Self-driving cars allow them to drive without licenses but I think the time that they spend with their parents in the car is very important for them."
4719,"I have never heard Google makes cars,so when I read this article,I was so surprised.I thought I wanted to get into a self driving cars someday,when I was a small child.That my dream is coming true in the near future.Autonomous cars is a good invention,but it has a lot of problem.I think great developers will solve it and make our life convenient one."
4720,"The number of traffic deaths has a tendency to decrease, but it is still a problem. The self-driving cars may surely solve this big problem that technology caused. However, I think that it is dangerous to depend all on computers when cyber attacks become a problem nowadays. Is it the best way that the number of traffic deaths reduces by improving an each parson's driving skills after all?"
4721,"It is embezzlement to spend the money of the company for the purpose of personal - going to the sexual club. The minister does not accept it, but I think that it is a problem that such an expenditure was done. Minister should take a certain action as one of the people on behalf of a country."
4722,"I wasn't surprised to hear this news title, but after reading this, I strong realized using this is still difficult. If all cars are changed to self-driving car, of course, it's very convenient. But I don't think traffic accidents decrease dramatically. Indeed, robot technology is used in many field. In car department, it become remarkable point. But, computer is not perfect. Traffic accidents happened inevitably. I hope that perfect computer system is invented as soon as possible, and that using self-driving car safely."
4723,"When autonomous cars will be on the market, we may not have to take a license. It is a wonderful thing, but we can not do anything in stopping the autonomous driving. So people who riding cars have to acquire the knowledge about safe driving."
4724,"When I read this article,I was surprised.But,I think this project is very interesting at the same time.I hope perfect self-driving system is cultivated."
4725,"Although developing technology is great and important thing, I think self-driving cars are dangerous for us. Certainly, a number of people die around the world in a traffic accident, but they won't work suddenly. Without driver's license, we cannot do anything when they don't work. So we should be careful of introducing them."
4726,"I think it is no longer just a dream that the artificial intelligence driving cars and humans not do because in recent years, there are astonishing progress of unmanned vehicle. If these technology will make steady progress, that is not impossible to invent auto driving cars and if it will invented, they are very useful. Autonomous will decrease traffic accident and jam certainly, and if it will link with traffic light and make network that control car stream, it will change the society to more efficiency."
4727,"Of course self-driving cars are epoch-making investment. Introducing them into general use will decrease the number of traffic fatalities caused by driver's carelessness,such as drunken driving. But they might raised new problem. If cars would be completely automated, people would not have to obtain driver's license, and delinquent boys would abuse these cars. I think we should not popularize them until new traffic regulation law system are developed."
4728,"I think that self-driving cars are very convenient because it is clear that accidents by the driving of the elderly person will increase in japan. But I think that it is difficult to make it widely available because there're no guarantees not to cause an accident. Furthermore, there are a lot of people who want to enjoy driving by themselves. I want to drive a car by myself,too."
4729,"I'm still not completely sure that self-driving vehicles 'hold the key to reducing traffic fatalities',but sincerely hope they do.If autonomous cars become safer than ones human drives someday,I will use them.Until that day,just hold on...Go!Google!"
4730,"I think autonomous cars are very convinient.In fact,they make the physical weak drive weak. However,if automatic system were broken,a big accident would happen.Convinience is very important,but we should consider safety."
4731,"I did not know the existence of the self-driving until I read this article. An eco-car running by electricity appeared recently, but now development of the self-driving cars advances. If the cars spread all over the world, they will decrease traffic jam and accident. Moreover production of the cars brings big development and economic effect in various fields. For example, production of new parts, the computer which controls driving, fuel development and service using the car. But the article introduced in The Nikkei said 'who takes the responsibility at time when an accident happened by the car? 'and 'what do we do for the license system of the car?'and so on. I hope that these problems are solved and the cars are spread all over the world."
4732,"I think autonomous driving car is good. If we use it,we won't be tired when we travel by car,therefore the number of accidents will decrease. Although it is the fact not to secure the safety of autonomous driving car because nobody use it by now. If robotic technology diffuse in the future,its reliability will increase."
4733,"I was surprised, when I read this article. It'll reduces the burden of the people by this technology. It is very important because when the driver is tired, accident rates increases. So the number of accidents is reduced by this technology. I want the Google to develop this technology."
4734,"Knowing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I don't know the cars are developed to such a step. Certainly, if all of the cars in the world become automatic, car accidents will decline dramatically or disappear. However I'm afraid of this future because people will forget how to drive and in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability."
4735,I agree to realize the society of self-driving cars in the future. That is because I think that autonomous driving contributes to decline the number of traffic accidents by preventing driver's carelessness and mistakes.But I feel fearful a little that artificial intelligence instead of us operate everything in our society. I hope the engineers in artificial intelligence take a risk of the intelligence into consideration and develop the autonomous driving system cautiously.
4736,"If self-driving car is come true, elderly people who can not walk by themselves can go around by themselves. And, this tech can reduce families' burden who want to go to distant places. On the other hand, tech is not perfect.So,if we can realize it, the number of accidents will not decline,I think."
4738,"It's really good thing because human can do more efficient things instead of driving. However, 'hacking' is huge problem on this issue. Becoming self-driving car common means enormous cars can be hacked and they will be murder machine. Google has many hopes and issues now."
4739,"I don't think autonomous cars are ultimately going to save millions of lives.Without saying that self-driving cars will be convenient by most people.However,computer aren't perfect so accidents will be inevitable. In fact,there are many trouble by using computer. These troubles may not decrease in the future but I think it's OK ,because If computer become perfect, people will be decline."
4740,"I think that autonomous vehicles are very very good invention. Nowadays, the traffic accidents are increasing. The more increasing the people which have vehicles are, the more increasing the accidents are. So, I must make ideas which are measures of the traffic accidents. autonomous vehicles are very great as the idea. Therefore, I conclude that autonomous vehicles are great measures."
4741,"This technology is very amazing and interesting.And it is also amazing that the number of traffic accidents will fall.Someday I want to ride the self-driving car. But I wonder if we can deal with them,when they malfunction or break down.Even if the technologies are fantastic,safety depends on our way to use them."
4742,"I think this movement is a good thing because I'm afraid of having a car accident and I don't want to get a driving license. If these car appear in the future , we needn't go to a tiring driving school !! In spite of these good aspects , there are some problems,driving regulations, safety ,license ,responsibility of the accident and so on. In any case, this problem will take long time to solve."
4743,"I believe self-driving cars can change traffic conditions all over the world. they don't become tired, sleepy and unconscious because of sick otherwise humans do.Therefore,transportation using Self-driving cars is very safety.In addition,using self-driving cars releases people around the world from traffic jams.Traffic jams are one of the biggest problems in modern society.It is generally said that traffic jams caused by not to keep appropriate distance between a car ahead. However, self-driving cars can keep ideal distance.Thanks to self-driving cars,traffic jams will disappear in the future. Transportation using self-driving cars is very safety and making efficiency."
4744,"Self driving car will help people who cannot drive by themselves, and it is a revolutionary technology. However, it is uncertainty that a self driving car will not cause an accident. Therefore, I think that we cannot unconditionally say that it is a safety technology."
4746,"Of course self-driving cars make our lives much more convenient than now.And they must reduce serious accidents caused by driver's carelessness. But they are not perfect.For example,self-driving cars can't response to unexpected accident immediately.And they make children who don't have driving skills want to operate them.That may lead serious social issues. So,I think that self-driving cars should not be popularized until their safeties become certain."
4747,"I think we can solve various problem if all cars become self-driving cars. For example, traffic jam is it. All cars are managed by computer, and information of traffic is shared all cars. And then they think and flash way to arrive at earliest and most comfortable. The danger of traffic accident also largely reduced. So self-driving car is very useful and we should expect completion of it."
4748,Autonomous cars have a lot of merits and may make our life better. However driving cars is so fun that we want to drive by ourselves. For this reason I don't think that autonomous cars will win the market.
4750,"I think that self-driving cars is completed soon, but I cannot agree this system. It is because I think that the accident caused by the computer happens. Who is to blame for the accident? The government has a lot of need to think about including revision of the law."
4751,"Indeed technology and artificial intelligence should be advanced more and more. But if the autonomous car causes an accident ,which people have a responsibility ,do you think? Also most people have difficulty in answering the situation.And also nobody do not want to take a responsibility for the matter.Probably people wants the company to take the responsibility.To advance in the technology is important for the people.But if we want to incorporate the system,we have to consider the law carefully and carefully."
4752,"Google thinks the technology of self-driving is better than previously driving . And I think so. Because if the car move smoothly ,there is no traffic jam . Traffic jam is course of Global warming . That is our earth. So we have to do our best for the earth even if we can do only little things!"
4753,"I think that this technology is amazing, because it will reduce many traffic accidents. But if self-driving vehicles spread more, people who work as taxi driver and bus driver and so on will lose their job. So we should think about them."
4754,"I agree with this article's opinion that Japanese afraid of declining Kanji skills. However, I think they still have motivation to write Kanji because many people try to learn it and have its skill tests(Kanken). So if they have more opportunities to write kanji, they become more interested in kanji,and ease their anxiety. I think it is important to teach the pleasure that write kanji to children. We should continue to maintain the place where children can learn kanji from now on."
4755,"I agree to self-driving cars being sold in the market.This is because it can avoid the fatal accident with the car, and people can enjoy a drive more comfortably. However, the self-driving cars does not secure complete safety.I hope that the safety is secured."
4756,"It is true that self-driving cars are convenient and have the benefit that people who don't have a driver's license can drive. However, is artificial intelligence always correct? On the road actually, there are lots of dangers. For instance, there are lots of complicate traffic signs and children that suddenly run into the road. Therefore I cannot be relieved safety of self-driving cars."
4757,"We should be careful when introducing the automobile cars to the market because it's fatal thing. Advance of technology is quite useful to improve people's lives, however, sometimes it invites an end to the civilization."
4758,"It is true that autonomous cars are very useful and they will reduce car accidents,however I think many people enjoy driving on their own. If driving becomes automatic, many people lose their fun of driving."
4759,I think that self-driving cars are great invention in that we can protect the environment and we could avoid a number of accidents. But I don't think everybody likes the system of self-driving cars because there are some people who really likes to drive by themselves. So they should make cars which we can choose when to drive.
4760,I think that Google car will be completed in the future. Now technology is so advanced that we can do what was thought to be impossible in the past.
4761,"Self-driving vehicles are very convenient for all of aged people. For Japan of the current aging society, self-driving vehicles will help them very much because the driver who cannot drive can go to the place where he or she wants to go to by self-driving vehicles. They will help not only the elderly person but also the people of the person with a disability."
4762,"I want car to drive. If this car could be true, I'm so exited!"
4763,"When I read the this article's headline ,I think autonomous cars will make people happy . But when I read this article completely , I think autonomous cars will make them dangerous , too."
4764,"Until I read the news,I did not this news. So I was very surprised to read. Because it is amazing. When I was a child, I thought that my mother or father can drive with sleeping to go to Disney land. Someday when I will a woman, I can drive an automatic car. But those cars are real safe? This article says traffic accidents will really decrease? I think if they introduce this system in earnest , they should be more accurate judgement."
4765,"When I read this article, I think that it is very wonderful invention. If there is self-driving car, the people who don't have a driver's license can move easily. Furthermore, it is good for environment if the car is an eco-car. The car which is good for both environment and a person is very great. However I worry that when balls rolled, what happens to a car? The car should allow you to react ti an obstacle, but a car does not push if forward before when I react to a too thing in front too much. I think that it is important seeing with the people's eye."
4766,"On the one hand,autonomous cars will reduce traffic fatalities and make it possible for those who don't have driving license to drive from children to elderly. On the other hand, because of autonomous cars, hobby,so called 'drive',will disappear and fire taxi driver and bus driver and so on. Therefore, we must think carefully whether we introduce autonomous cars."
4767,I was very shocked to hear this news I knew an irresponsible person like him for the first time. I am very regrettable that many men and women of the age that is about the same as me died because of him. I think that person in charge must have a serious sense of responsibility by all means. And we must not forget this affair.
4768,"Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article 'Google certain of teleportation"
4769,"Automatically car has existed only in sci-fi world for a long time. But now it is becoming a reality. Technology works. It's so exited whenever I imagine what kind of the future we will live in. In the next generation, people may read the article 'Google certain of teleportation machines in the future'."
4773,"If we can use autonomous vehicles easily in the future, we can go anywhere without driver's license. Add to this fact, to use that will contribute to decrease traffic accident. From these points, we can use those vehicles easily and comfortable. But it will make the situation which there are lot of people who work as a driver will lose their job. Therefore I think to provide autonomous vehicles will do bad effect our society. So we should not generalize it which we use autonomous vehicles."
4774,"I was surprised at this article. Until I read this, I don't know Google's autonomous car. If this car is so safely, I want to ride in a car and go wherever I hope. The point which I am so excited is that people shouldn't acquire driving license. Otherwise, the point which we have to rethink is that streets and parking will change this style when autonomous car spread."
4778,"Reading the headline of this article, I was interested in self-driving cars. At first, I couldn't imagine autonomous driving. But, I ensure that self-driving cars run on the streets in the near future. Self-driving cars have a lot of benefits as the article says. Above all, it is a very good point for self-driving vehicle to reduce traffic fatalities. I hope that the cars will be useful for people."
4808,I think that fourth example is the most useful notebook. That is because this notebook include some sentences to use words in daily life.
4811,"When I looked this article, I realized how I was not good at vocabulary learning. I become to know there are many types of vocabulary notebooks. Personally, the second example's style was the best for me because writing example sentences made it easier for me to remember vocabularies. I also think vocabulary notebooks are one of the most useful tools for learning a language. But in my case, I used vocabulary notebooks only for tests.So,I'm going to try make notebook which can improve my speaking skills."
4818,"I strongly believe that the vocabulary notebook plays the most significant role when learning foreign languages. Whether we put collocation, pronunciation, synonyms and etc depends on our purpose which we would like to improve as listening or speaking and so on."
4824,"I think that it is to place an example to be important in making a vocabulary notebook. This is because we have to not only understand the meaning of the word, but also use the word in sentence. I intend to put down the use with a meaning in a word to come across for the first time after now."
4835,"I have a lot of friends who are from Fukushima. When the terrible earthquake occurred , they had many difficulty. I know the terror of nuclear power, and people who suffered losses by nuclear power. I won't see the damage of nuclear power. Certainly we can generate electricity efficiently by nuclear power, but we have another way to do it. I think we shouldn't use nuclear power because it has a bad influence."
4837,"I also think that self-driving cars make our lives safer and more comfortable. Giving an concrete example, we can reduce the traffic accidents because of drowsy driving. If truck drivers can sleep in the cars running automatically, they can work efficiently after arriving at their destinations."
4838,I mainly agree with this news because self driving cars are much more safer than cars which was driven by human. But I am worried about accidents which self driving cars may cause. I want these firms to make safer self driving cars for our safety.
4839,"I mainly agree with this article because self driving cars are much more safer than cars which are driven by human. However, I think that self driving cars are not perfect. I want these firms to make safer cars for our safety."
4840,"I don't want the government to use nuclear plant to produce energy. There was nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2011. I felt scared to see the accident on TV, and I took pity on the people of Fukushima. In Japan, there are a lot of energy sources such as geothermal. I think it has no reason to use nuclear power absolutely. The government should think about not using the nuclear plant, and replace other energy."
4841,"I am excited to see self-drive cars! But If we buy this car, wouldn't we need a driver license? If so, I am going to be sad because I just get it last month! Though I am excited about self-drive car, then, how will the trains work? It seems the same that we ride on the train and use the self-drive cars. I am also afraid of our cognitive abilities will go down."
4842,Nuclear power is very risky but suddenly decreasing nuclear power is necessary good. It is because suddenly decreasing nuclear power increase burning power and increase greenhouse gas. Therefore not that nuclear power forcibly is changed into burning power but that nuclear power slowly be changed into natural energy is good way.
4843,"The FIT system is quite magnifique to encourage the use of green power source. We have to earnestly think about how we live with limited source. In recalling the tragedy in Fukushima, we should never make it happen again even accidentally."
4844,"Certainly, geothermal potential is huge and geothermal is cheap, reliable and works 24 hours a day. In addition, it's dangerous to use nuclear power. However, nuclear power the most economic. The price of electricity rise increasingly, so we are needy. Inventing renewable sources, first of all I think we should turn nuclear plans back on."
4845,"This is very stimulating story for us. In japan, after Fukushima disaster, it is very animated at discussion of way of energy provision. I think we have to search many way of energy provision because if it will be impossible to provide energy one way, we can cover it by another way. Dispersing risk is basic thinking of energy policy. So, I think we must not throw away the technique of nuclear. Of course, we know about the risk of nuclear disaster, but at the same time, we have to think about if we lose all way to provide energy except nuclear, what we should do."
4846,"We experienced the tragic accident in Fukushima that costs much time and money to recover. It is extremely difficult to ensure the safety of nuclear power. So I oppose resuming nuclear power plant operations. However, if we abandon nuclear power, in actually, we may possibly suffer from a serious electric shortage in the near future. Consequently, I think what we should do is to economize on electric power and to develop renewable energy sources positively."
4847,"I think energy problems are very complicated. In Japan, we have reconsidered nuclear power's problems such as higher fuel bills and higher emissions since we experienced the Fukushima disaster. I don't support a return to nuclear power because it is the most important to ensure the safety of human lives. Following the Fukushima disaster, Japanese government has been pushing ahead with generating renewable power, but there are also some problems. I think cheap energy is important for me, but for the earth and Japan, it is important to improve green energy because there are limits of natural resources. I think we should reconsider the future renewable energy based on a hard look at what things will be like ten years from now."
4848,"I don't agree with the policy change by Shinzo Abe to turn the nuclear plants back on. Firstly, nuclear energy has bad and fatal points than good points. I know that nuclear energy has good points such as lower cost. However, nuclear energy has bad points such as radiation, radioactive waste. In addition, as we went through Fukushima disaster, we cannot restore environment completely. Then, people who lived in near nuclear plant cannot go back to their house. If we continue to use nuclear energy, same situation would happen. All in all, I believe that we should shift into energy that is safe and environmental. I hope safe and economical energy will be developed to replace nuclear and thermal energy in the near future."
4849,"I think Japan's government depend on a nuclear power plant too much.A nuclear power plant can generate many electricity.So it has many denefits.But it has also many risks.March,2011,big earthquake occurred in the Tohoku district.Many people had to take refuge.Because,the nuclear power plant went up in a tremendous explosion.So we should stop to depend on it.We should use solar panels on own house and think a good way to produce many power."
4850,"It is difficult to spread electricity without nuclear power. But to think the Fukushima disaster, we can not use the power easily. If such a disaster happen again, Japan will have to spend enormous time and money for the solution to the problem. Japan has not utilized the power enough yet. So I think Japan should try to spread renewable energy. Therefore I think it is better to use renewable power than to use nuclear power."
4851,"I think that renewable energy is very good idea for protecting Japanese nature, so I think that japan should use renewable energy. There are 3 merits of using renewable energy. First points is that renewable energy is good for environment. For example if a day proves right,the photovoltaic power generation is possible. The toxic substance does not appear. Second point is that resources do not disappear. Japan has few resource, so the securing of resources is important. Third point is that if japan use renewable energy, it is not necessary to use nuclear power. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the nuclear power generation is dangerous. for reasons of above three, I think that Japan should use renewable energy."
4852,"I think that the study of renewable sources should be supported increasingly. Although japan needs the cheap reliable power, we have to shut down nuclear power plants in the future. Preparing for that time,we must find the other effective ways to generate energy."
4853,"The Fukushima disaster in March 2011 influenced and changed not only Japan but also some countries, I think. We all realized the nuclear reactors' fear and Japan shut down all of them in Japan. It is still maintained, but I think that their restart is not so far. Surely, I don't want Japan to restart them because of our and our children's living on the earth. I claim that we shouldn't depend on the power of nuclear. The technology here is pretty developed so we must find better ways of making energy efficiently without nuclear reactors. Also, if selling electricity becomes more common, more the better ways will be found from its actions. Briefly, the expanding of solar system will solve the energy problem shortly, I think. I wish solar panels' prices will be lowered."
4854,"Turning the nuclear plants back on will be a big help for getting energy, but it is dangerous and risky. Recently, though we do not hear the news about the nuclear problems, we have to think about them seriously. It is a important problem for Japan."
4855,"I think that the return to nuclear power is risky because earthquakes increase recently in Japan. However, depending on thermal power generation is also bad for environment. The earth is not a thing only for Japan. It is desirable to use the renewable energy to the maximum. Now technology is developing every day. So, I believe that it is realized."
4856,"We tend to think that the way to keep Japanese electric supply is nothing but the return to nuclear power like Abe's argument. Also, the risk of nuclear power is forgotten recently . However, there are a lot of potential ways to generate renewable energy in Japan. So,I think that Japan should use not nuclear power but more reliable and cheaper power such as geothermal."
4857,"I agree with nuclear power generation for some reasons. It is true that some people say that as a nuclear disaster happened in Fukushima,nuclear power generation is dangerous. However, it is a man-made disaster and nuclear power itself is not dangerous. Japan has few natural resources and ways to use natural energy such as hydro, wind, tidal, solar and, geothermal, so Japan need to depend on nuclear power.Of course, the problem of radioactive waste must be considered. Meanwhile the way to use natural energy has to be improved."
4858,"I think Japanese government should switch around renewable energy from nuclear power. In fact, nuclear power plant accident cause serious problem in Fukushima. However, renewable power don't spread yet. So,Japanese government must spread renewable power in all of Japan."
4859,"After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult."
4860,"I think that an alternative energy source should be examined for its safety, efficiency and so on.Since Fukushima disaster happened, nuclear power generation became serious problem. In other words,before that people are not rejecting for nuclear power generation. If nuclear power is managed properly, it should not be abolished.If an alternative energy source is introduced,government should reveal its safety."
4861,"I think the nuclear power is very useful. Nuclear power generation can be suppressed carbon emissions compared to thermal power generation. However, I think it is dangerous to rely on nuclear power, because the earthquake occurs many times in Japan. In 2011, an accident had happened at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station. This accident resulted in extensive damage. So, we should know that the nuclear power is very useful, but if we mistake in how to use, it is very dangerous."
4862,"After Fukushima disaster, we cannot use nuclear power. So we should find new power energy, wind, solar, tidal, and geothermal. However these energies are little energy, so the solution to this problem is difficult. Present Japan exhausts a large quantity of CO2.This is very bad in environment. The global warming turns worse more if not improved."
4863,"A nuclear power has advantage that make much energy cheaply and easily. But also it has risks. We should not forget the nuclear accident in Fukushima in 2001. This accident frightened us. Disappearing radiation flowed in the sea and was blown by wind. So it brought damage in many area and changed our lifestyle. Actually, my parents came to use Water Server to hear the news which many radiations were detected in the tap water. I think it is necessary to use renewable energy effectively. I hope life that don't depend on nuclear power comes true some day."
4864,"I think nuclear power plants have to be shut down. Nuclear power is dangerous. Japanese government must think another power that can replace it. I think the best power is energy of ocean current, because Japan is islands and it is surrounded in the sea. To shutdown all nuclear power plants promptly is very difficult, but we have to keep thinking how shut down the plants."
4865,"The government should promote not nuclear power but renewable power, I think. Renewable energy has some advantages. First, they will contribute to conservation of the environment, because they don't discharge exhaust fumes and toxic substances. Second, if we make good use of renewable energy, natural resources won't be exhausted. However, there are also disadvantages. For example, it's difficult for renewable energy to secure of stable supply, and they will cost a great deal. So I think Japanese government need to give financial assistance and reconsider the location of renewable power plants. I hope that renewable energy will spread someday."
4866,"I have heard a Japanese proverb, ' Penny wise and pound foolish.' It means that the people who want to buy one as cheap as possible is likely to fail in shopping. Just for Japanese government, it can said the same thing. The government decided to push the burning lots instead of nuclear plant. I think this decision will be cause big problem such as promoting global warming or blackout that happen in whole area in Japan. Japan has various natural power for energy, especially, geothermal have big power. Of course, it required many time and labor, but the government should invest to such powers for the future."
4867,"When I was a high school student, I belonged to the newspaper club, so I have interviewed people who were from Fukushima. I realized that they tried to revive as hard as they could. I think what we should do is to know the present situation and think of the future in Fukushima. It is a true that Japan needs a lot of energy, but the most important thing is people's living safety and peacefully. The new energy comes into existence, however, there isn't enough it, so I think the government should provide the young with the opportunity that they could learn about the energy,disaster and future.I believe the young who are cultured may invent the sustainable energy in the near future."
4868,"I think that if we can spend life without nuclear power, it's the ideal future. But now, there're no option other than nuclear power which is cheap, stable supply. So I agree with the Abe government's argument that return to nuclear power. In any case, a proper reason is necessary to choose energy option, because we take responsibility for explaining it for the next generation.What we have to do now is thinking about how to provide a structure of mix energy in a good balance and hoping there will be large output from renewable sources in the future."
4869,"I think that we should stop using the nuclear power. Because,it is too dangerous not only for us but also for people who will live in this world.Considering safety, we can not help doing it."
4870,"I think nuclear power is so dangerous,but we will use this energy forever. Because prior to the Fukushima disaster nearly 30 percents came from nuclear. we Japanese depend on nuclear power. But, we should generate electricity in other way. Fortunately, there are many ways in Japan. I think we should take advantage of geothermal power. Many volcanoes are Japanese feature. For example, Norway has many huge dams and a plentiful supply of water, so there are many hydroelectric power stations. Japan should imitate this case. There are many negative points to built a geothermal power plant.,but we ought to utilize this way."
4871,"I think nuclear power is dangerous,but we should restart nuclear power plant.Japan will develop more and more in the future.We will reach the time that other energy can't provide Japanese society with electricity.No one have absolute safe way.We must be ready to choose a little dangerous way.This opinion applies to other field,for example,politics,economy,etc..."
4872,"I think that Japan should increase the supply of renewable energy. The generation of electricity by nuclear power is certainly efficient. However, from now on, it is very important to promote the use of renewable energy in consideration of safety. We must not forget the tragedy of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011."
4873,"In terms of safety, shutting down all nuclear power plants is the best way. However, if we do so, we can't get sufficient energy continuously. After all, we must develop technology to generate electricity more stable than what it is, I think."
4874,"I would like to know why Prime Minister Abe supports nuclear power so strongly. I have never heard of people positive about nuclear plants around me. At the same time, I wonder whether there are any problems with geothermal power suggested in the article. I believe Iceland, famous for the great hotspring called Blue Lagoon, exploits geothermal well. In Japan, there are some hotsprings depending on geothermal as well , but it is not utilized to maintain our lives. I hope the idea of renewable will spread more."
4875,"I think that the nuclear power is not reliable power, so I disagree the return to the nuclear power. Indeed, the nuclear power is the cheap big power. The point is favorable. However, the people who live in Japan have threat of the nuclear accident. Therefore, I conclude that we should not make the nuclear power return."
4876,"I think that nuclear power is a good way to generating electricity,but it is too dangerous.It can supply large amounts of electricity stably,but after the Fukushima disaster,not only Japanese but also the people in all over the world are afraid of danger of the nuclear power.I think nuclear power is no longer the best way to supply electricity."
4877,"I believe the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies should try to invent ultimate renewable energy producing system.At first,ultimate renewable energy producing system contribute to decrease greenhouse gas emissions.Moreover,the Japanese government and Japan's big energy companies can earn big money. Environmental problems,especially global warming,are controversial in modern society.When they invent it,they can sell their technology to other countries. In conclusion,in order to contribute to stop global warming and promote the national interest,they invent ultimate renewable energy producing system."
4878,"I agree with using the nuclear power . I know that nuclear energy has good points for example low cost and good for global warming .However, nuclear energy has bad points. For example danger for us. I concurred that points and I prefer before one because Japan doesn't have a lot of money. So I decided that"
4879,"I don't support the return to nuclear power. Although we can cheap and reliable power by the nuclear,it's very hazardous. Nevertheless,we have not been able to deal with spent nuclear fuels.And now,many anti-nuclear power plant movements are held not only in Japan but all around the world. So,Japan should develop the new ways of power generation right away."
4880,"I think that to use nuclear power is good way to generate electricity, but it is too dangerous to keep for people of the world. And there are many energy sources in Japan, so we should to replace other energy."
4881,"When I read this article,I was surprised to know there are many ways to generate energy in Japan.So,nuclear power in Japan should be banned because there are many earthquakes in Japan,so nuclear power is too dangerous. From this reason,I think Japan should use alternative way to nuclear power."
4882,"I don't support to return the nuclear plants back on. That is because even if the nuclear power is able to generate the much electricity at one time than other power generations, it is so dangerous that I cannot believe it do no harm to people. Certainly, other power generations without the nuclear leave much room for improvement. But we should think of the priority of safety."
4883,"Certainly,nuclear power is dangerous if we use it in an improper way,and I know the Fukushima disaster was a terrible one.However,considering the current situation in Japanese energy consumption,I think whether we can stop making use of nuclear power or not can only be guessed at.This is a difficult problem."
4884,"Nuclear power is very useful. It don't discharge CO2 and generate a lot of energy. Administration think it is an ideal generation for Japan which has hardly resource. However, we should recognize risk of nuclear power and Japanese resource. Japan has a lot of nature and many hot spots. these will become hydropower and geothermal power."
4885,"I think Japan has to continue to do without nuclear power. this is because ,today, Japan has been suffering from radioactivity. And now, Japan has been coping surprisingly well without nuclear power, so we don't have to use it intentional."
4886,I think Nuclear power generation is very important for Japan now. This is because why I think like that is we cost much money and labor for generation. We can make power from Nuclear and it cost few amounts of money. Certainly if An accident happens of Nuclear power plant it must be Crisis for the human. Therefore human should more study about Nuclear and control it.
4887,"I don't agree with Abe's plan to Turn the nuclear plants back on. Of course it is difficult to produce enough electricity for us to live without nuclear.however seeing the tragedy of Fukushima,we should think about the danger.also Japan has a lot of renewable energy sources. We should use these sources."
4888,"Certainly,nuclear power is very useful. But we have to decrease it to protect human beings. The nuclear power can generate the energy easily .In this aspect,it is very good. But if the incident happens,for example Fukushima disaster,we can not do anything. So I think we must stop using nuclear power plant."
4889,"I think that nuclear power plant must be shut down. Of course,without nuclear power plant,governments could not supply electricity adequately. However,if governments build sustainable power plant while they shutdown nuclear power plant step by step, they could supply power sufficiently."
4890,"I think Japanese government should decide to make use of more geothermal power generations. Certainly, the nuclear power produce a good deal of energy cheaper than other renewable energy. However, we must have the risk of radiation accidents at the same time.On the other hand, Japanese people have been suffered from eruptions for a long time and there are many volcanoes in Japan.If we are able to make use of them efficiently, which will be Japanese strong point of making electricity and help us have comfortable life."
4891,"The Abe government said that nuclear power was better than other power generation from the financial viewpoint, but I don't think so. Even if earthquake isn't occurred and don't cause nuclear power accident, it has been always had problem of hazardous chemical substances. The disposal of the waste needs technical way and there is few place that allow to bury these risky substances. Therefore I think nuclear power plant will actually make Japan's finance worse."
4892,"I don't think we should be using nuclear power anymore, because It's obviously not good for environment and we haven't found the way we coop with those things after we used them. And as the articles says, we have lots of potential ways to generate renewable energy so we should make most of them. We should be responsible for not only us but also next generations."
4893,This news is surprising. But the highest price of picture is 'Nafea faa ipoipo? ' pictured by Gauguin. Its price is about $300 million! I think this kind of money should be used for other constructive things.
4894,"I think that it is not excusable to use nuclear power in Japan. The safer nuclear power is the desirable. However, it is accompanied by high risks and this is well known to us. That is why the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 was the greatest disaster Japan had ever experienced. We must never cause such the Fukushima disaster. But practically, today Japan's big power companies are faced with major risks and challenges. They should maintain a nuclear phase-out policy and promote the introduction of renewable energy more readily and willingly."
4895,"I think nuclear plants are very dangerous, and restarting them is so scaring. Many people are suffered from radioactive and died of it.Even if nuclear power is effective energy source, I oppose running it. I hope more alternative energy appear in the near future."
4896,"Nuclear power is very useful.But I think we should not too much rely on this power.Conversely,we should use this power to some extent for stable providing power.Of course,it must be thought for risk and trouble.I think Japan should search for good balance to using balance between nuclear power and other safety energy."
4899,"I know the damage of the Fukushima disaster is very terrible. For example, radioactive pollution and involving damage caused by a rumor is also big problem. Not only Japanese people, but also foreigners around the world were influenced and avoided Fukushima's food at that time or now on. However, I support a return to nuclear power plants. That's because the cost of thermal power generation oppresses japan's finance. Besides, I think, the safety revel of nuclear power plant is being developed and terrible disasters are more controlled. But I also think, much renewable power which are ecological and a low cost will be used is the best."
4900,"If the data in this article is all correct, I can't understand the intention of government. Everyone want to safety. We just need to use geothermal which is beneath us."
4901,I think indeed unclear is need our life.But we should use to replace unclear energy.
4902,"Many of Japanese people have thought that the nuclear power is so dangerous and it gives them the only bad influences since 2011. However, I think we cannot say that it is absolutely bad, because the Japanese people relied to be supplied with electric power by the nuclear power, so we could use electricity. In addition, I am from Tohoku, and I heard many opinions about the nuclear power after the Fukushima disaster. A half of them disagreed with a claim that all nuclear power stations should stop running."
4903,"I was surprised to see this headline. I can't believe that some paintings and sculptures were sold at more than $100 million in recent years, and moreover, it's not those who love arts but the very rich that bought these artworks. I agree that the art market boom is all bubble that could burst at any moment. Now artworks play an important part in investment. However, it won't last too long, I think, because the thought that art's prices will rise resembles the myth that land prices will always continue to rise. So I think the art market will stabilize sometime."
4904,"I was very surprised to read this article. I don't familiar with art and artist, so I can't understand why some people buy the work of art for such a too expensive price. I think they can use the money for doing something else. For example, they raise money for refugee relief. But the work of art perhaps have the reason why it is expensive."
4905,"I accepted easily the idea that traffic accidents will decrease by self-driving cars. But ,as ID1545 says, there is no conviction. I agree with your opinion that computer power is not necessarily perfect."
4906,"I agree with your opinion. I don't feel like using this car either. The defects of the self-driving cars may be found, after they are used actually. And I think it's difficult for automobile cars to run a way where existing cars and pedestrians exist."
4907,"I cannot believe there are people buying a picture with millions of dollars. I think those art works should be kept in a good condition in a museum. In that way, many people can see it and it will be inherited to next generation. If I were a billionaire, I would donate money to developing countries rather than keeping one painting in my hand. I am not saying the painting is not worth the price, but in my opinion, people should share the valuable work in a public place such as a museum."
4908,"I did not think of the problem with job opportunities and it is something we need to consider. Even now, there are some exploited trains without a motorman. The problem is closer than we think. I also wonder if the autonomous bus is reliable. Bus drivers take measures suited on occasions. They help elderly people, children or anybody who needs a help. I believe it is what only human beings can do. I hope those warmth and kindness will takes priority."
4909,"I was surprised to read this article. I'm not interested in art , so I cannot understand why people want Picasso's picture to pay so much money."
4910,"I agree with your opinion. I think so, too. These prices are too high for me to pay. I don't want to buy a Picasso for enormous money."
4911,"Seeing this blog, my sense about value of art has been changed. I think that we may as well go to museums rather than buy pictures to enjoy works of art."
4912,"The Fukushima disaster reminds us of a risk of nuclear power. We depend on this power very much. The nuclear power is very dangerous. So, we cannot use it eternally. But, there is no energy to replace nuclear power absolutely. Now we cannot use the natural power as a substitution of the nuclear power. The Japanese government should find strong natural powers immediately. And we should have interest of this problems more."
4913,"As you claim, if self-driving cars become widespread we all can move by car including those who don't have a driver's license. However, people without a licence don't have enough knowledge about driving. If a traffic accident is likely to occur, they will not be able to do anything. I think it is dangerous to drive a car without a licence even if the car is self-driving one."
4914,"I felt nuclear power was dangerous and threatened people when the Fukushima disaster happened. And I think renewable to make energy of Japan are safer and reliable, so Japan should prevail them more by using efficient ways."
4915,"Losing control of nuclear power caused the Fukushima's secondary disaster, so Japanese people think about renewable more. Certainly, there are many people who object to nuclear power, but Japanese government cannot help using it because other means are ineffective. We should consider whether nuclear power is really effective or not for Japanese people."
4916,"I want Japanese government to be more think Japanese economic perspectives. We Japanese need grow our economic first. So, it seems that nuclear power is dangerous, we can't help but use it."
4917,"I think that nuclear power is so risky and we must be careful when we use it. The accident was caused in Fukushima in 2011. I felt so scared when I heard about the news through TV news. Japan has other ways to create energy except nuclear power, so I want Japanese government to use safe ways."
4918,"I think nuclear power shouldn't be used in Japan because of Fukushima disaster in 2011. In the accident, many people were scared by threat of nuclear. There are a lot of ways to make electricity. Safety way must be practiced. In other words, anyone must not threatened by power generation. I hope that good way of power generate will spread all over the world."
4919,"I think that renewable energy is useful, but it may take many years for us to use renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. For example, geothermal power plant needs much money and extensive lands. Also, most of the plant is made by our national government,so the cost to made it is covered by our tax. Renewable power revolution is important,however, I think there are a lot of problems for the power."
4920,"I think that the government shouldn't use nuclear power to produce energy because nuclear power is so risky. When I saw the nuclear accident in Fukushima, I felt the timing that we had to stop using nuclear power came. There are many kinds of natural powers to produce energy in Japan. We should utilize the each power, thinking about the merit or demerit of each natural power."
4921,"I was surprised at this article. I knew self stopping cars, but l don't know an existence of self-driving cars. I agree to make cars. For the man, I like driving by myself, who is poor at driving the cars is needed. I would have Google company generate."
4922,"I was surprised to read this article. I can't imagine myself buying an art with millions of dollars even if I were a billionaires. I want them not to buy an art so that we can see a lot of arts forever. In my opinion, billionaires should use their money for other aspects such as saving poverty."
4923,I can not believe that there are some pictures priced at million dollars. I can not judge the price is whether proper or not because I am not acquainted with art. But I feel the price of ' Women of Algiers' . It is not good to preserve these famous and excellent paintings in private place of investors. Many people should be able to see these great arts. I think public museum should have paintings.
4924,I can't understand that Picasso's painting 'Women of Algiers' was sold in so high price. I think people who buy pictures in absurd price merely want to show their financial power and can't appreciate picture's real worth. This is why I am sad that such people monopolize valuable pictures and people who really have good taste can't see them.
4925,I agree your opinion. I think these great arts are monopolized by only a people and other people can't see them.
4926,"I don't know that autonomous cars have become very popular. I think it is very good to save millions of lives by them. I felt an era and techniques are changing even today. However, i think that i will become scary when i ride such an autonomous car. But a car driven by human is more dangerous than the car.... now, the traffic accidents caused by drowsy driving have become big problems I think. Self drive cars can reduce such as accidents !"
4927,"When I heard this news, I think if Picasso live now, he can get much money. $179 million is extraordinary price for painting. I can't understand art so I wonder why common painting can get these extraordinary price. However, it is not good for general people because the arts got extraordinary price, general people can't look arts in museum. Museums can't buy the arts. It is my only fear."
4928,"I agree with your opinion. If self-driving cars can realize, but there are problem. It is vulnerable of computer system especially, electronic disturbance. Computer system can hacking easily so if self-driving cars realize, it is questionable for increasing traffic accident. Driving license is need one I think because if car was hacked, the driver have to cut down the power and control car."
4929,"First of all, I was surprised at the sum of the bidding's beginning. It is so expensive so I realized that Picasso was one of the greatest artists again. Also, the auctioneers attempted to pay their large amount of money for pictures so I knew that there were a lot of art lovers around the world. Frankly speaking, I cannot understand the value of arts well so I had a doubt why they could pay a lot of money for a picture. Though, I felt that rich people using their money is good for economy. The circulation of money can perhaps make poor people a little richer. It is sad for us that we won't watch these masterpieces, but the problem of wage gaps is more important, I think."
4930,"I'm not familiar with art, so I was very surprised that paintings are sold in so high price. Also, I felt it incongruous that state of economy influences on art. The equivalence of painting itself won't change, but price is easy to change depending on economy at the time. I think it is a pity that art is used as kind of a investment and people who really love art cannot appreciate the art."
4931,"I was very surprised when I read this article and I had two opinions. First opinion is that it is waste of the money. There are many poor people in the world and there is the person who cannot eat food. There is the person whom it is awkward for that the world does not have money, so i think that the person who have a lot of money should save poor people. Second opinion is that it is important to save culture. If a picture sells only at a low price, painters are in trouble. The work of art is important for the history and culture. If a rich person pays a high price to a picture, the art becomes active. Therefore I think that it is waste of money, but it is important for save culture."
4932,"I agree with you. Many people should see the historic painting. Particularly, it is agreement at the time to spend money for developing countries."
4933,"I can't understand the art which prices $179 million. 'Women of Algiers' passed the record of 'Three Studies of Lucian Freud' in minutes. I am not familiar with arts, but I can guess Picasso's arts are so rarely and so expensive from this article. The problems that some of the world's greatest paintings are rarely and people who love arts can't see Picasso's masterpiece are so severe. I hope some methods of settlement. I think that only the richest can see the masterpiece is too bad fact."
4934,"I don't understand billionaires accepted bids for 'A PAINTING'. Although Picasso is a great painter across the world, I wonder at the equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. In addition, Picasso's painting is human heritage. So a person shouldn't own it. People who want watch it should be able to watch it."
4935,"When I read this article first,I was so surprised.I am not interested in arts,so I don't understand how much value Pablo Picasso's 'Woman of Algiers' has.But I can understand the only one thing.That is waste of the money.I want those who have a lot of money to donate."
4936,I agree with your opinion.I think such a thing is waste of money too.Those who have a lot of money should use it for society and the poor all over the world.
4937,"I was surprised at a price of painting when I heard this news. I cannot imagine such a price concretely because it was far from our daily life. Therefore, I believe that painting should not be bought at too expensive price. To begin with, worth of paintings lies in technique, historic value and rareness. People who love paintings truly can evaluate true value without price. Market price should not be a criterion to evaluate the worth of art. In addition, using paintings as tools to produce money by private investors should not be allowed. Otherwise, public museums can't buy masterpieces because of its expensive price. It means someday we would lose chance to see them. All in all, because there are lots of faults to value paintings in price, we should not put an expensive price to paintings. I hope if private investors have much money, they should use their money for something to contribute to the society and get to be aware of genuine value of paintings instead of price."
4938,"I agree with your opinion. I think that we should find new power energy too, but these energies are limited. Considering nuclear power's merit,we have to solve this difficult problem ."
4939,"Through this article, I was surprised that works of art was so expensive. I think it is useless for private investors to spend much money on expensive works of art. Since I cannot understand good points of works of art, if I were billionaire, I would spend much money on more important things.Of course,different people have different values, but I wonder how private investors find good works."
4940,"Your suggestion about alternative energy is great. I thought that nuclear power generation should not be abolished,because alternative energy is not yet established. If a study on energy of ocean current advances, the nuclear power generation is not necessary. I hope the day when energy of ocean will come to lead the generation of Japan."
4941,"I don't know that the Picasso's painting was bought the most expensive in 2012. I'm surprised at the high price. It is difficult to understand worth of paintings. However people need to see and have knowledge of arts, because people should learn ideas of great persons. So it is problem that public museums can't keep up with private investors at recent auctions and they can't get the paintings. Public institute should act for that everyone can see famous paintings."
4942,"Maybe some items are worth its price but it should not only depends on historical or technical value. Like the Picasso's work costs $179.4 million, it can be evaluated by our emotion, and we can perhaps adopt this mean of evaluation to the other items too."
4943,I totally agree that it's pity that whether we can see valuable arts in public is dependent on the economy. Government or some institutions have to preserve our right to enjoy that culture of arts so that it encourages artists too.
4944,I agree with you. People who have much money such as private investors should not only invest in their business but also contribute for the benefit of the society. I cannot understand for what purpose they invest huge money on such a painting.
4945,"I was surprised to know the final price of the paintings equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. I feel the price of the GDP of nation should be higher than paintings. According to the last paragraph, almost people who really like art are not the rich. They feel to enter the museum is expensive. I think this situation should be changed. All people who love art should be able to see art easily."
4946,I agree with your opinion. I think people who love arts are especially yearning see Picasso's masterpiece.
4947,"I was very surprised to read this article about the inflation of the art market.To tell the truth,I can't appreciate art,especially surrealistic art such as Picasso.So it shocked me to realize that the painting had been sold at $179 million. I would like to see those paintings for which were bid a high price someday."
4948,"I am belonging to orchestra, so I am interested in art. But I was surprised about Picasso's painting's final price. I think $179 millions is too expensive for Picasso's 'Women of Algiers'. Because Picasso's works of art is newer than other works of art. For example, Stradivarius and Leonardo da Vinci's works of art."
4949,"I was surprised that Picasso painting sold for record $179 million. I can't understand the value of the picture.The reason why I think like that is that I am not interested in art. If I have $179 million, I will spend money on buying expensive clothes and eating high-class food. Will the day when I understand the value of this picture sometime come? ....This answer is no."
4950,"The painting sold at a high price such as Pablo Picasso's 'Women of Algiers,'Edvard Munch's 'The Scream,' etc. is just a painting, I think. Monopoly of artworks and cultural heritages by the rich can deprive people who do not have money of opportunities to enjoy art and to acquire culture. In my opinion, billionaires should invest their wealth in education of children in developing countries. They are responsible for aiding people in need."
4951,"When I read this article last week, I was really surprised at the final price of painting that was equivalent to the GDP of some island nations. I am not interested in too much paintings and have a poor knowledge of art. Therefore, I cannot understand why billionaires spend a lot of money on a piece of picture. It is very difficult to evaluate art and set the price because different people have different sense of values. I would like to see Picasso's paintings which have captured the hearts and minds of people around the world someday."
4952,"I was very shocked to hear this news because I think that billionaires who buy masterpieces of art at auction personally behave high-handedly. Do they have the awareness to buy up splendid work of art? Maybe, they don't have them. If they were a member of people who love art purely, they should stop buying up them."
4953,"I think that not private investors but public museums are appreciate to own paintings,because it can be studied further by specialists.The very rich should become a patron of the arts of young artists and support the development of the art world."
4954,"I agree with your opinion. After Fukushima disaster, all people afraid of nuclear power. So, I think from now on we use renewable energy."
4955,I agree with you.I not interested in arts very much.I think that probably the rich cannot understand the value of the art too.They just need something appreciate to invest their wealth.
4956,I am surprised at this news too! I think you are saying right thing because it is impossible for art's price to rise forever.
4957,"Even if I were a millionaire, I wouldn't use my money for just 'a piece of picture'. I don't understand why people want to buy them. In addition to that I don't think price in art market should be rising like this. This is SO insane..."
4958,"I was very surprised to see this title. I think this painting's cost is too high. At the same time,I feel shock to hear that this soaring price cause the crisis for museum. In this article, it is said that billionaires are forced to buy a painting because the value of another is cheap for them. I think, in the future, our society will be controlled by a handful of billionaires, and the people who have a little money will be excluded. In order to avoid this situation, we should promote to share the famous works. If so, we will be more sensitive to art and we can improve ourselves more."
4959,"Certainly the nuclear disaster in Fukushima was very pathetic, but nuclear power is very attractive for Japan. Since Japan has few natural resources, nuclear power energy is necessary. And nuclear power gives Japan a chance for having nuclear weapons. Today China is threatening neighboring countries, so Japan need to reinforce the self-defense capacity. The issue of developing nuclear weapons should be worth discussing more . I agree with introducing another green energy such as tidal, wind, and geothermal energy. Japan should develop the renewable energy while using nuclear power energy."
4960,"I agree with you. I knew about the inflation of the art market for the first time when I read this article. In addition, I don't have prior knowledge to understand the value of those paintings, too. So I cannot believe that billionaires won a bid for a Picasso painting with $179.4 million!"
4961,"I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government think only today's coping method, and they cannot make effort to improve energy system."
4962,"When I say honestly, I can not understand how valuable this picture is. I usually see pictures on magazines, but I hardly see the pictures of the art which are displayed at museums. I want to understand the art, so I gonna mention much art."
4963,"I think that even a picture of Picasso is too expensive.I do not understand the value of the picture.So,I do not know why this picture is so expensive.I think that I may do it more if I have $179.4. An individual often buys an expensive picture recently.I think that I want the art museum to buy it.After all I want to see the picture in an art museum."
4964,I thought that nuclear power should not be used when I read this article. but I knew that I could not say like that easily because Japan didn't have enormous energy instead of nuclear power. So I really sympathized with your opinion which we must be ready to choose a little dangerous way.
4965,"Shingooooo! That's good idea.I was surprised by a technique of google, too.Not only the car but also all techniques are great.The times when a car of the auto comes up come soon. I am fun!"
4967,"I don't have knowledge about pictures,so can not judge whether this picture is worth or not. However, I think that money used for pictures should be used for helping people .By doing this, many people will not be in trouble."
4968,"I'm not interested in painting, so I can't believe this article. Value of things is different from person to person. But Picasso's arts are known as the wonderful arts to many people. It is awesome! I want to make something which get to recognized the value to a lot of people."
4969,"I think so. It's too expensive. I don't understand why the cost of Picasso's painting is higher than One57 penthouse, 1000m2 apartment in central New York."
4970,"I do not understand the reason why some people want to buy those expensive pictures. Actually, Picasso's pieces are of great value. However, even if I know those are fully worth, I won't buy them. People have a different sense of value, so I understand that some of them find pleasure in collecting worth pieces. Nevertheless, I will save up money that some people use for pictures for a rainy day. In addition, I was reconfirmed magnificence of Picasso's pieces by this article."
4971,"I have not realized the problem that many people use cars without licences. And,I also think that when we are driving by ourselves and in danger of the traffic accidents, we are able to find the dangerous situations.But, if we use self-driving cars,we will not pay attention to situations and cause more accidents."
4972,"I agree with your opinion. I think there are a lot of paintings which are not known to many people. It's be very wasteful, not known to many people even if there is wonderful. So, I think painting industry should make an effort to have many people appreciate a painting."
4973,"I agree with you. I also do not understand why some people spend their money on those pictures. However, I am curious to know an attraction of Picasso's pictures, too. Therefore, I wish I could see some of his pieces with my own eyes for once."
4974,"At first,I can't understand this phenomenon.And I wonder why they spent so much money on buying a picture.This is why I have not been very interested in art. However,one of my friends are very fond of art,and he often go to museums.So I want to him to tell me the interest of art."
4975,"Your opinion gives me a new way of thinking. In fact,only th rich can try to buy a precious picture like Picasso's picture."
4976,"I am surprised at the price of Picasso painting, because I don't know art.I don't think the final price, totaled $179.4 million which is the equivalent to the GDP of some island nations is worth buying. Also, knowing the affairs of bank and museum , we need policies that the rich can use money more effectively."
4977,"I have never known this trend, so I was very surprised to realize these art works are worth much. In fact, this trend have a bad influence, but I think it is very important to keep our history and civilization. I'm not familiar with art, however, I often watched and enjoyed the pages about art in my textbook when I was a high school student. What I learned at history classes is that art has been treated preciously and evolved with human beings. Therefore, the most important thing is to remember there wonderful achievements. I think as long as people discuss how to buy and display art works, real art worth doesn't disappear."
4979,"This topic told me the current world of art. I knew many people who loves art can't see pictures and sculpture freely because a part of billionaire monopolizes them. If we should limit for billionaire to buy them and museum should make effort to attract general customers,art will be everybody's thing."
4980,"I agree with your opinion. Many people is interested many fields,for example,art,music.sports,etc. We needn't change our interesting fields. But it is so important that we try to understand other fields because we need understand various world now."
4981,"I agree with your opinion that we should stop to depend on nuclear power and think a good way to produce much electricity. Producing much electricity only by solar power is difficult. And depending on one energy is dangerous. So, we have to use many kinds of power. We should think many good ways of producing electricity."
4982,"Actually,I didn't have so much interest in arts, so I didn't worried about such a state. Now, I believe what a few rich people keep these heritages is wrong. Certainly, due to the recession, it is difficult for banks to keep interest rates high. Also, museums can't afford to invest much money to gain arts. Therefore I think museums make an appeal for contributions to get valuable arts for appreciation, education and progress of society."
4983,"Nuclear energy is certainly efficient source that provides a great amount of energy constantly. But it is essential to take into consideration its danger. In fact, safety myth the government argued is out. We must pay attention to both positive and negative side of this energy."
4984,"I don't know feeling that I want to buy an expensive art. Indeed, reasons which the writer of this issue show us is reasonable. I understood that buying an art have great merits. However, I think that demerits is more than merits. I want to make my life safe."
4985,"I think so! I understand the art contains important references to art history, but I can't understand the value of the art, so I can't believe Picasso's painting was sold so high."
4986,"I'm sorry for everybody not to be able to look at arts which the popular artists such as Pablo Picasso painted. Certainly, the valuable arts are so expensive that not only the general public but also museums cannot afford to own them. But I think more people whether we have ample money or not should have opportunities to appreciate masterpieces. So I hope museums take steps to improve this situation."
4987,"I think so. I think that money used for helping people is more valuable than money used for picture, too. Indeed, there may be value of pictures. However, things have the order. There should be actions which we must do earlier."
4988,"I know there are many people who are interested in art, but I can't understand buying pictures so high price! In addition , if someone buy the important art and it is closed to private home , not only other people who want to see the art can't appreciate it for a while, the study of a painting is also behind . I think individual shouldn't buy the important pictures in terms of saving of arts."
4989,"I agree with your opinion because I also think Japanese should know nuclear power has a danger.To realize our opinion, we should be interested in the problem about Japanese energy and make efforts to gain exact information."
4990,I have the same opinion. Museums should improve this problem. I think Artist themselves should change this situation into the ideal which many people can see the masterpieces of Picasso.
4991,"I agree with you.The price bid for Picasso's painting is not acceptable for those who are not interested in too much paintings and have a poor knowledge of art. But,maybe,we will come to be attracted to art by seeing these paintings."
4992,Those who buy too expensive works are very rich and they want to buy things any other people don't have. So Picasso's painting was sold for $179 million.
4993,I think so too.I think that those who want to watch works can watch them.
4994,"I did not know about art the worth of picture well, but this archive is so interesting for me. Although the greatness of Picasso is widely known for his creative works, such as Guernica and so on, it is surprising news that his work was bought so high price as 1.79 billion dollars. I think money game by billionaire is even influence to artistic circles. The loss of masterpiece from public resulted from occupancy by the rich is unfortunate."
4995,"I agree with this idea.To drive cars without license is very good for us.Also,I believe that we rethink our life style.When autonomous cars spread widely,we use cars more frequent than today and the road is very crowded and greenhouse gas emissions increases."
4996,"I also surprised at this news. In my opinion, the rich who want to buy those expensive picture see them as not picture, but the way of investing their extra money which banks cannot offer. But when the masterpiece is stolen, they will lose great amount of money at a time. I think private investors should spend their money on immovable estate, such as islands."
4997,"I agree with your opinion. Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms. We must not forget the memory of 3.11 and always pay attention to the news about nuclear power, getting information on our own initiative."
4998,"When I read this article, I was surprised . It is so expensive that I can't pay for them in my future. I think even if Picasso's painting it is just pictures! And I can't understand their worth . So I was surprised"
4999,I think so too Because it's just pictures!
5000,I cannot understand why they spend so much money for pictures and sculpture. It is too bad that people cannot appreciate it because a work of Piccaso is kept in a personal house. So I think that individuals should not buy them for the other people who like pictures.
5001,I agree with your opinion. The problem of the disposal of waste is serious. I think that we should use renewable energy.
5002,"I was very surprised when I heard this news, because I didn't know value of some paintings were more than 100 million. I couldn't believe it. But it is that many people are interested in these picture to be worth such. So I think these pictures should be seen at a public place."
5003,"I was surprised at to hear the news.Although Picasso is very famous and great artist,the prices of his paintings are too high.This is because works of art like Picasso's paintings become investments. Therefore,some masterpieces are invisible due to privately owned. In order to appreciate works of art everyone, great works of art like Picasso's paintings should be owned by museums."
5004,"I 'm surprised at this news, too. I also can't understand why this picture was bought in such a high price. However, only Picasso can draw it. I think this is why it was bought in such a high price!"
5005,I was surprised at this news and can't understand those who bought expensive paintings. I think that these masterpiece should belong to the country where artist was born and be preserved appropriately. Certainly art market boom have good impact on economy. However only the very rich benefits by art market boom.
5006,I think so too. It is ironic that the rich's arrogance results in art market boom and positive economic effect.
5007,"I can't imagine $179 million. I knew that investors bought arts for investment, but buying arts for investment isn't so good. Parts of investor don't understand arts. Moreover, there is danger of losing and burning historical important arts. So, museums in the world should have and take care of important arts."
5008,"At first, I think the rich use their money for the poor.However, if they don't do direct actions like donating their money to orphans, buying paintings stimulates economy and makes the circulation of the money active. It can be said that this action also contributes to the poor."
5009,I was surprised to read this article.I am not interested in art so that I can't understand the price and the man who bought it.ithink it's a waste of money.
5010,"I think so. Wealthy people should have responsibility as having man. For instance, they contribute local community, do fund raising and think better society. If they couldn't do so, they would have no right to have wealth."
5011,I was surprised at the news. Because I am not interested in painting. I have no money to buy the painting and I can't understand the worth of the painting.
5012,"First I was surprised to hear the news. Because I didn't believe that the painting is very expensive. If I was a billionaire , I don't use money to bid the painting. Well I don't interested in the painting. Anyway I hope that billionaires should use money in another way ."
5013,I agree with your opinion. I can't understand the worth.
5014,"I was surprised to hear this news very much. It is because I can't understand why paints are made a deal at so high price. Certainly, I think the paints are very important to study the history and culture. But the high price make difficult to study easily. I think it is also very important thing to see and study it easily. If the rich buy up these we will not be able to see these and it is very sad, I think."
5015,"I agree to operating a nuclear power plant again. It is because the cost of the atomic energy import is cheaper than oil and gas for thermal power generation. In addition, Japan may fall into electricity shortage without nuclear power generation."
5016,I think so too. Some people who have much money should use it something else.
5017,"I think so, too. I can't understand why the paints became so high price. Billionaire must not buy up these and they have to show the paints everyone who wants to see."
5018,"I know there are various ways to use money,and many rich people wanting to spend theirs on something valuable in terms of art.However,I still can't think the picture is worth the price.It's too high."
5019,"I can't understand why the picture was bought by so expensive price. However, I think art should be understood and respected. If there is no art, our lives are very simple and are not interesting. So, I'd like to learn art and the things which attract us like art (music or literature or ...) and understand the reason of the expensive price."
5020,"When I read this article,I was surprised to know that there are many people who pay much money to buy expensive art works. I can't understand why they are attractive. And I think present auction system makes important artistic works invisible to public. This may lead studies of artistic works hard."
5021,"I also think the price is too high,and precious art works should be open to the public."
5022,I agree with you about the idea these pictures should be publicized. I think monopoly of arts is a sad thing.
5023,I agree with your opinion. I think government should support museums to be able to obtain worthy artistic works.
5024,This kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event in Europe because the number of homosexuals seems relatively large.
5025,"I think it is too expensive to buy the picture. If such pictures are kept by billionaires who are small percentage of all people, it is a pity that most of the people cannot look at them."
5026,"When I read this headline , it is surprising for me that Picasso's masterpiece is more expensive than I think . But , when I finish reading this article , I understand the reason of the high price because I know that Picasso's masterpiece contains more references to art history than most college courses ."
5027,"I am not interested in painting and can't understand the worth of the Picasso's painting ,too."
5028,"I have known that Picasso's pictures are high.But I think it's too expensive. Even if I have read this article last week,I couldn't understood people who pay the too high cost for this paint."
5029,"I also think what millionaires use their money to monopolize human heritage is wrong. On the other hand, I can understand their feelings, that is to say they want to increase their fortunes, so they buy expensive arts and keep them to sell at more high price in the future. I believe that the millionaires will donate that money which they'll increase to common good."
5030,I agree to .People should do by yourself as you can.
5031,"I fully realized that each has one's own value. We don't want to pay $179 million for a picture. But, someone paid it in fact. Apart from whether or not I will be a a billionaire, I'm wondering that I can't find something I want to pay $179 million. Will I be able to meet such a value for me?"
5032,"I do not have knowledge about the art very much. Therefore I do not know why some people pay high money to only one piece of picture and obtain it. However, I think that I want them to inherit it carefully because the old picture has serious historic significance."
5033,"I can't imagine that, neither. But, I think everyone can use their own money for their own desire. Of course, volunteer is a one virtue."
5035,"When I read this title, I couldn't understand what it was. But as I read this article, I thought it was wonderful for everyone to think about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality, but it is an age when there are many gay or lesbian in the world. So I think we can't discuss many things without them now. I think Japanese has the prejudice why they love same sex. So Japanese should recognize them and have the attitude which encourages homosexuality. From now on, their right will be guaranteed immediately."
5036,"I think that the movement that the minority like homosexual is received in everyday reality will be needed as time passed, this example is the first step to promote tolerance. In Japan,same-sex marriage was accepted at Shibuya lately. From now on,we should spread these movement."
5037,"I had heard this news on TV, but I didn't think there was potential that people couldn't appreciate Picasso's painting. The very rich should invest in other thing so that people can appreciate a lots masterpiece. And I'm afraid of that a bubble of art market burst suddenly."
5038,"I think that we should more actively promote movement as homosexual being accepted. I think that now,many people accept homosexual. However most of them don't want to discuss this subject aggressively. Therefore accepting homosexual have not been prevalent. Let's discuss accepting homosexual."
5039,"I think that it is good idea that the billionaire buy costly paintings, because it dynamites the economy. There are some people who suppose that historical heritage should be kept in museums, but I think that almost all collectors deal with them carefully, therefore, no worrying for inheriting them."
5040,"I was very surprised at this news and this unbelievable price. In this material, it is said that Billionaires increasingly own international politics and cultural heritage, but I think these masterpieces should be exhibited for not only billionaires but also ordinary people. If so, we can share the value of these pieces."
5041,"It is good for emphasizing equality between normal couples and others to take this measures, but I think we don't have to use icons of a couple in traffic signals."
5042,179 million is so expensive! I can't imagine such a high price. I think people tend to be not able to judge calmly especially about their hobbies like art.
5043,I cannot imagine myself buying artworks in such a extremely high price. I feel it is not good for the very rich to buy up precious artworks because arts shouldn't be owned by only the rich. Everyone who loves art should own precious artworks.
5044,"I don't have sense of art, so I don't know why Picasso's works are so high costed. But I think it is not so good for famous and valuable art works to be rarely shown to public view because they give impression people."
5046,I agree with you. Precious artworks should be owned by art lovers. They must want to get the art the most. Billionaires should yield to the people who likes the art sincerely.
5048,I agree with you. I also cannot imagine such a high price. And I think that these famous picture should be saw by not only rich people but also other people.
5050,"I agree with you. Nuclear power reminds us of Fukushima's disaster, and it gives fear to people. As the article said, I think that geothermal power is good because it use natural power and is much safer than nuclear power."
5051,"I was surprised at the sum of bidding, too. I also agree your opinion about the sharing of the value of world masterpieces. On the contrary, I thought that auctions by rich people were continued because of money circulation. I hope that the billionaires who own international politics and cultural heritage will hold their exhibition for everybody."
5053,"I agree with your opinion.I also cannot understand value of Picasso's arts.But many riches want to buy it.So it is very valuable, I think.But, I think there is many poor people around the world too.So I think that rich people should spent money for poor people."
5054,"I cannot understand the worth of Picasso's masterpiece.Because I wonder that anyone can draw arts like that.But the price of art is 179 million.So I think people who understand the beauty of the art want to get this for a large amount.Picasso is known all over the world,so everyone know his name.So I think his art is very valuable for just him painting.By the way I don't want his arts for expensive price."
5057,I agree with you. Preserved excellent art works by private investors must be the cause of luck of art works that many students study arts with. I think famous art works should be on display at public museum. There are many people who have not so much money to by some art works but want to see them
5058,"I agree with your thought. Everyone has own values, so so someone who understand the beauty of art will want to get this art. I think it is good for us to try to appreciate pictures in order to widen our vision."
5061,"I'm very interested in Picasso's picture. It has a power to tell us about the history or culture at that time , so I understand it became very high price but I think billionaires should spend money more on the other thing. If it was not so expensive, we could appreciate the picture of Picasso or a lots of master pieces. It is important that we understand the worth of historical painting and learn history."
5062,I agree your opinion. It is not good thing the study of paintings is behind by someone bought the important art. I think we may be able to share the worth of the painting.
5063,"I agree with your opinion. I also felt the cost is too high. Your idea which solve the problem is good. To promote to share the famous works is very important for us. I think how we can promote to share the famous works. However I can not give a concrete example, we should try to think about the way which to share the famous works."
5064,"When I read this article, i couldn't understand immediately. Because gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. Many gay TV celebrity are succeeding in Japan. So if Japan import this traffic signals, we will be tolerant about gay culture."
5065,"I was surprised to hear this news because I didn't have such an idea as gay and straight traffic lights. Also, I was astonished to know Vienna are generally positive about new traffic light. However, in Japan, I believe that most people may not be positive to set up these traffic lights in the city. Recently, Shibuya Ward decided to issue the Partnership Certificate to the same-sex couple. I'm not familiar with such movement. But, we should accept this movement for mutual understanding and happiness of our society."
5066,"At first, I couldn't believe the traffic lights exist in the city. It is difficult to judge whether the idea is right or not. Certainly, many people tend to be positive about homosexuality in recent years, but there are the objection. Although there are many kinds of opinions, it is the homosexual's opinion that most important."
5067,"I was surprised at this article when I read it.I think homosexual is received gradually in many countries,but Japan has a sense of discrimination for homosexual.We should promote the movement that homosexual being received all over the world like 'gay and straight' traffic lights."
5068,"This article is difficult for me to understand. Picasso painting is sold for$179. In other words, the painting has so high value. But, I don't think that it is worth. Art is savored deeply."
5069,"I think so, too. I can't believe that the Picasso painting has so high value. I want to know the real worth of art in the future."
5072,"I haven't bought any works and haven't experienced any auction so this article was new for me. Richest people can use their money freely, however, I don't know is it the best way to spend their money."
5073,I'm interested in Picasso's picture. This picture has a power to tell us about the history or culture.I understand it is very high price but I think billionaires should spend money more on the other thing. It is important that we understand the worth of historical painting.
5074,"I tend to agree. Because I think nuclear power is dangerous. In Fukushima, so many people were scared by threat of nuclear power. So we must be used safety power. For example,geothermal and so on. Now, Japan should develop that make other safety power."
5075,"I was surprised at autonomous cars have become very popular. This topic is very interesting . Because they must be safety drive more than people . I think that car accidents will be disappear in the future. And if people go out to dinner,drinking alcohol ,autonomous cars instead of the people . I hope that it becomes the reality early."
5076,When I read this title I was surprised . This article is about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality. I think that Japan must think about a homosexual than now.Japan should recognize the homosexuality properly.I strongly think that it should allow you to live without being discriminated even if homosexual.
5077,"I was surprised at the article. Picasso is too famous. Surely I know him, but I can't understand his works. I think those who buy his works is stranger."
5078,"Installing 'gay and straight ' traffic lights is a good idea, I think. These days, gay isn't out of the ordinary any longer. More and more people should accept them, and we shouldn't discriminate between gay and straight. 'Gay and straight ' traffic lights are the first step for equality and equal treatment. That's why I think we ought to spread this trend."
5079,I tend agree. I think to.
5080,The news surprised me. I can't understand why these people buy the picture that is so high cost
5081,"I was surprised by this news because I have never seen such signals. But I mainly agree with this topic because I think it is good to promote same-sex couple. I think it is wrong to give equal right not only to straight couples but also gay couples. I also think that it is not good to have bad image based in their race, nationality, and sex. I want Japanese government to install signals like Vienna."
5082,I was surprised to see this article. I have seen only the traffic light with a man. I think it is a good idea. It will amaze me when I wait the light changes. Furthermore It means the society allows same sex couple. I want Japan to install this traffic light.
5083,"This traffic lights show our modern society. Recently, in Japan, the issue of gay and straight attracts our attention. But in Japan, we can not see and feel concrete activity which linked to those people. So when I read this article, I thought Japan should do an action recommending such people like a foreign country. I feel Japanese people have to try to think about this issue more seriously from now on."
5085,"The world is changing. Should Japan also change in terms of tolerance of same-sex marriage? I disagree with approval of same-sex marriage for some reasons. It is true that some people say that same-sex marriage is an individual problem so a definition is legally necessary. However, Japan has a tradition that people regard their family very highly. If same-sex marriage were legally allowed, Japanese family system would be destroyed. Should Japan accept 'global standard' without criticism? I don't think so. In addition, most Japanese people are biased toward same-sex couples. Whether same-sex marriage is approved or not, same-sex couples will be permanently prejudiced in Japan. Same-sex couples had better leave Japan. Therefore in Japan same-sex marriage should not be legally allowed."
5086,"When I first read this article, I was surprised because I have never seen these traffic lights. Recently, I think these couples are gradually accepted in the world, so I think it is good to set up these traffic lights. However, technically speaking, we Japanese aren't sensitive these various couples, so I think it is important for us to understand them."
5087,I think so too. I expect people accept this idea and epochal action in Japan.
5088,"Today, there is a various kind of love such as gay. For them,prevailing the thought that such a kind is popular is important. Of course, we must think the demerit of this. For example, gay couple cannot birth their child. In particular, in today's Japan, low birth-rate is one of the social problem. For the benefit of group, we shouldn't promote this campaign."
5089,"I have never heard of the idea of gay traffic lights. I think it is a great idea because I can think of no negative points trying this. I agree with the voices of people on the street in this article. I also believe this idea should be considered in Japan as Shibuya, for the first time in Japanese history, allowed same-sexual marriage recently while most people seem apathetic. I hope these sexual problems will be discussed more in Japan."
5090,"Homosexuality begins to be accepted now in the world. But in Japan, the problem about the homosexuality is rarely taken up in the media. So,this idea is good for Japan because people become able to think that homosexuality is not a special thing.But I want Japanese government to use the tax for a more important thing, for example, social-security, the low birth rate,electric generation,and so on."
5091,I agree with you. The valuable work should be inherited forever. I cannot understand the sense of values of the billionaire.
5092,"I've never seen such a interesting traffic lights that arouse my curiosity strongly. Although Austria's Freedom Party make an objection to them, I agree with these designs. As the article says, the 'gay and straight' traffic lights will make people pay more attention to traffic safety as well as take more interest in homosexuality and equality. That is killing two birds with one stone. Especially, amid the progress of diversification of values, I think we should turn our eyes towards the matter of human rights for gay people earnestly. So, I think that designs are very nice."
5093,"I think it is good idea that gay traffic lights are fit up.Some country meditate the problem about homosexuality and take action.In Japan,I sometimes watch a news or program about homosexuality on TV.But,everyone don't think seriously about it.But, there are gay and lesbian in Japan too. So,we should understand homosexuality and take any action to save them."
5094,I have never seen these traffic lights too.So I was surprised when I read this article.There are seldom gay or lesbian around us.So it is quite difficult that we understand them.But I think it is important to understand them.
5095,"I agree with your thought.The nuclear power is very dangerous.We use safety power.But,if we use only safety power -geothermal power without using nuclear power,we will run short of power. So this problem is very difficult."
5096,"When I read this article, I was very surprised, because I have never seen such traffic lights. And I think that it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. In Japan, I've watched homosexual people on TV, but I didn't think seriously about them. So I think we should introduce this idea."
5097,I think that it is very interesting idea. I want to look at such a signal in Japan. The problem about sexual become more serious. Recently same-sex marriage came to be accepted abroad. The problem about sexual is apt to be avoided in Japan. However we should think the problem about sexual. I strongly believe that we should make tolerant society about the sexual.
5098,I agree with you. I think that Japanese government should make tolerant society about the sexual. The Japanese should get rid of prejudice. Each one should think about sexual.
5099,"I agree with you. In Japan, minorities had been ignored. So that, we should accept diversity in every field such as sexuality."
5100,"I agree with your idea. We Japanese are insensitive about this issue, so we should try to understand them and discuss whether Japan install these signals or not."
5101,"I agree with your idea. I think it is good to show these historical paintings for public. If so, not only rich people but also other people can enjoy these paintings."
5102,"I have a same idea. When I first understood the Fukushima disaster, I felt scary and Japan should stop using nuclear power because there're many risks. We should think future power deeply."
5103,"I think so too. There are a lot of nuclear reactor in Japan, but nuclear power is dangerous. So I think Japan should use another power. This problem is not somebody else's problem but our problem, so we have to think deeply."
5104,"I think your idea is good. Recently, there are a lot of automatic things such as cars, and mobiles. However, these automatic things are not complete, so it is not good to rely too much. We should be careful around us."
5105,"I think your idea is good. If so, everyone can view paintings and learn art. I don't have sense of art too, but I would like to enjoy these paintings."
5106,"Me too. I have never seen these signals and I didn't know these signals were existing. When I first read this article, I was surprised, but I think these diversity is good and we should try to understand these issue."
5107,"I think so too. There are many traffic accidents and people who die in traffic accident, so if these automatic car prevail, the number of these accidents and people will reduce. However, if we ride automatic cars, we should be careful."
5108,"I was convinced your idea. If so, a long-distance truck driver can be more relaxed. There are still problems about automatic vehicles now, but in the future, these things will be developed and prevailed."
5109,I agree with your idea. Japan experienced the Fukushima disaster and reconsidered nuclear power's risk. We have to discuss which energy we use in the future deeply.
5110,"I think that it is good idea to make people think about same-sex couples. Since homosexuals appear in a program as an entertainer, Japanese people are tolerant of homosexuality.It is important to promote tolerance and the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. Many countries should install traffic signals like Vienna."
5111,I agree with you. We should pay attention to the issue of homosexuality.
5112,"When I heard this news, I think this is very interesting tackling. Recent years, it is more important about the equality and we have to be anxious about the minority. This tackling is the one way of keep equality and reform of peoples consciousness. I want to try this tackling in Japan too."
5113,"It was not until I read this article that I knew 'gay and straight' traffic light in Vienna. I think this idea is very unique. In recent years, homosexual problem has been accepted gradually around the world. Also, countries that legalize same-sex marriage is increasing. However, it is not legal in Japan at present. I think Japanese government should promote these movements more than now. And we must deepen our understanding of the homosexual issues."
5114,"I was surprised at this article title. I couldn't image of gay and straight traffic lights at first. But I think this signals are good, because it is possible to attract attention of pedestrians and driver to traffic signals. So it can reduce accidents. And also, people will be able to understand about gay more and more."
5115,"There is a prejudice against homosexuals in Japan. In fact I also, but one person to have a prejudice. I know that since the rights as a person is in everyone equality, it's free to become who to love.But I think that there is still resistance against homosexuals. In order to eliminate this feeling also, the movement held in Australia is very effective. By the government to represent the attitude that accepts gay, prejudice against homosexuals will fade."
5116,"I think this idea is efficient because it is good for not only attracting the attention of all road users, but also promoting the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. However, seeing these traffic lights only once time is not radical solution for prejudice of same-sex couples. To think same-sex couples normal, we need to seeing such couples as much times as different-sex couples in our life. But the number of same-sex couples are small, so the spread of these traffic lights is necessary for our equal life."
5117,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is too expensive and I want to see the picture in an art museum. It is need that people see famous painter's pictures, so museums have to make efforts that they get them."
5118,"When I read this article at first, I remembered the news that same-sex couple's marriage is admitted in Shibuya. However, I think an understanding for that trend is not popular in Japan and it takes time to spread to the whole Japan. In my opinion the movement for encouraging gay people is a good idea in equal treatment. I want this action spread in Japan,too."
5119,"I think it is very important for everyone to think about same-sex couples. Recently, I often hear about the system that same-sex couples could live comfortably. In my high school days, one of my classmates was a homosexual person, but he didn't hide the truth and we never discriminated against him. I think he was proud of himself. Everyone's having their pride is very necessary to live in this world, so I hope to establish more the system that not normal couples but also same-sex couples could live comfortably."
5120,"I agree with this opinion . When I have been to Brighton in England , i feel something which like freedom . I am not gay but I feel that Brighton was comfortable for everyone. Even if women,men,normal,abnormal,young,old,people!"
5121,I felt that the idea of installing gay-themed traffic lights is very interesting because I have seen traffic lights that are only red and green. And gay-themed traffic lights are good to tell people that same-sex couples are a normal.
5122,"I can't believe that there are 'gay and straight' traffic lights in Austria. It is very good that the Austrian society accepts gay. However, that traffic lights is abnormal. WHY AUSTRIAN PEOPLE!"
5123,"The discrimination against the same sex couples are severe in the world, also in Japan. Homosexuals should be treated equally by other people even if they do not understand them. It might be difficult problem for all people. However, the society that people do not accept homosexuals cannot make a equal society. It needs corporations of people to make its society, therefore governments should consider a counter-plan to help people who are not able to be accepted their homosexuality by societies. Recently, some people who declare homoeroticism are increasing, so I hope it becomes a equal world."
5124,I think so too that such culture is not accept in Japan. And also we should consider this issue. But I think we don't need to make such traffic lights.
5125,"I think this event is good because we mustn't discriminate same-sex couples. In the past,we think they were strange. But now,number of them seem to increase. Our common sense always change and will change. Then we must change thinking and correspond to the situation."
5126,"I agree. I also think most of the Japanese people do not accept those movements. However, if it holds in Tokyo, more people may be interested in the same-sex couples. The traffic lights are seen by lots of people including foreigners, so it will be able to get an attention."
5127,I agree with you. It is epoch-making idea to insist on same-sex couples is normal. I think this idea is noticed by a people well.
5128,"I have never heard this news about the idea of unique traffic lights in Austria. I think it effective to understand LGBT. In Austria,some people oppose this idea because of contravention of traffic regulations and financial reason.However,a large number of 'likes' on the Facebook may reflect public opinion. Nowadays,I often hear the word 'LGBT' which refers to lesbian,gay,bisexual and transgender. But,compared with foreign countries,Japanese society doesn't seems to be tolerant toward those people yet.So,I think, Japan also should do some efforts like that."
5129,"I was very surprised to read this news.When I read it,I wondered if there is a need to set up lights at pedestrian crossing that show pairs of figures instead of the usual stick man.To be sure,a series of event of it is good,but,it cost much money.According to this news,it cost $70,000.I think it is a waste of money.The money can be used for a more important thing,I think."
5130,"At first,I couldn't understand,too.In japan,gay couples are not recognized except from a part of the area. In a TV show,a topic of gay is often picked up,but there is still a social prejudice.We have to remove it."
5131,I think that traffic lights should not be used as a poster because strange traffic lights can induce accidents.I also think this traffic lights do not promote equality. Everyone will look the lights curiously and not think about it seriously. I think the cost of this campaign should be used to other things.
5132,"Since I live in Japan,I've never seen the various traffic lights.So when I heard the topic, it takes time to understand it.Recently,the mass media has become to take up the topic about the right of a homosexal.I agree that gay should get the opportunity to live more comfortable.Thinking of the law system in Japan,however, there are many points of improvement to live equally.Following this topic in Australia,we need to think of the right of homosexual."
5133,"I think that billionaires should have the right of buying arts freely.But like your opinion,I want to see the invaluable arts and get the opportunity to be able to enjoy arts such as the museums."
5134,"I agree with you. The sexual problems are still difficult to solve. However, we should try to understand them."
5135,I think this idea would be able to diminish the prejudice that guy couples are abnormal. this plan should be done all over the world.
5136,"I also agree with your opinion. It is important to defence arts,but this price is too large."
5137,"Before I read the article, I'd never heard this movement. However, this is very interesting and meaningful. That's because this can make people accept homosexuality more. I want to do same action in my country. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't admitted. Besides, some people think they can't accept them. So, I think, there are people who suffer from their homosexuality. We should understand them more and shouldn't exclude them from society."
5138,I agree with you. I think installation of 'gay and straight' traffic lights in Japan will lead to promote tolerance and legalize same-sex marriage.
5139,I agree to your comment that this kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event but I think that it is necessary not only in Europe but also in all world.
5140,"I agree with you, because it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. So I want to try this tackling in Japan too."
5141,"I was surprised that there really exist gay and straight traffic lights. I don't have the idea of the same sex couples, so I doubt the necessary of this type of traffic lights. I don't criticise transgender,but I think that those traffic lights don't need."
5142,"I agree with you. I also think that it is good that the Australian society accepts gay, but this type of traffic lights have no utilities for the usual public."
5143,"This movement is interesting.It will help people become conscious of sexual minority,and make some of them tolerant of it.I think what is needed for same-sex couples to be accepted is general understanding and tolerance towards them,and these strange traffic lights will make a difference."
5144,I agree with your idea that you want the rich to inherit pieces of pictures which has historic signature carefully. It is the most important that historical pictures will be kept in safe.
5145,I think so. This campaign is likely to miss the primary function of signals. Keeping safety is more important than prevailing a new thought.
5146,"Certainly,like you,there are many people who don't have any bias against same-sex couples,but some people do.I think this movement is needed."
5147,"I agree with your comment.Homosexual people especially in Japan suffer from discrimination,so I think we should promote such movement as possible."
5148,"This traffic lights in Vienna are so interesting. And more interesting thing is many pedestrians like this concept. We should promote this idea that same-sex couples are normal. But, I think some people oppose it in Japan. We Japanese should introduce this attempt,too."
5149,I agree with you. This traffic signs is good for helping people be aware of sexual minority. But I think the icon adopted traffic signs should be more simple as well as the conventional one.
5150,I think that this trend is good . Japan should promote this idea.
5151,I agree with your opinion.
5152,"I was very surprised, too. We should imitate this idea and think more carefully about homosexuality. There is no discrimination."
5153,"This action is very favorable. I didn't know gay and straight traffic lights. I think that this plan and this thought are very good and should be evaluated. However, people don't accepted same-sex couples in Japan, especially. The task which we must do is to accept same-sex couples."
5154,I think this idea is very important for taking sexism away all over the world. Accepting gay officially is essential when we try to live in comfortable in the city.
5155,"I agree with the idea that Japan introduce that kind of device. In my opinion, Japan still ignorant of sexism."
5156,I agree with you! Not only Austria people but also Japanese should accept these traffic lights someday.
5157,"It is very difficult to execute this trial in Japan. Since Japanese society don't accept gay couple. this idea is not bad. However, Japanese should add other function to traffic lights. It is to display number of seconds before turning the traffic light on the screen of traffic lights."
5158,I agree with you. This idea will change prejudice of Austrian and people in the world. I pray that all people in the world will be able to live freely and happily.
5159,"I think Japan has to introduce this lights.This is because Japan has the bias to gender. If we introduce this, Japan can solve the gender problem."
5160,"I think so ,too. If we introduce this lights, we can live in comfortable in the city."
5161,I'm surprised to read this article.in many countries gays and lesbians are gradually accepted. However Japanese people still think these people negatively. I think we should be more liberal.
5162,I agree with your idea. This idea will make Japan better.
5163,"when I read this title, I wonder if 'gay and straight ' traffic lights are needed. However, when I read this article, I think that in order that people gain the understanding for gay, the trial like this is necessary. Particularly in Japan it is hard for gay to be accepted by others, so I think that in Japan the trial like this should be done."
5164,I think such movements in Europe are very strange and rational. We have to think about many kinds of thoughts we can't understand well to coexist on the Earth together.
5165,"I think, and I approve of yours. Why will this picture get such a high value? I cannot understand that I buy a picture paying money so much. I buy it if cheap..."
5166,This signal is very unique and is the thing getting a lot of looks of the person watching it. Therefore it will be a chance to have people interest about homosexuality to increase these signals. And it will be the opportunity that homosexual is permitted worldwide.
5167,I agree with you. I think also that we should spread such a movement in Japan. And I want to eliminate the prejudice against homosexuals.
5168,"I think about gay in generosity, and Austrians are think about gay in generosity too. I think that the idea of the signal of gay is grate!! I think that the racial discrimination is not good, because the people have various thoughts. We should treat gay like us."
5169,I think so.Those people such as gay or lesbian in Japan should be accepted more.
5170,I agree with you
5171,I don't think so
5172,I agree with you. I think this traffic light can induce accidents. They should promote the campaign in the other way.
5173,"I think this decreasing bias to same-couple plan is interesting and very important concept.In Japan,this concept is not perfectly recieved.But it is going to usual in Japan too I think.Because,I heard the news that same-couple is admitted in Shibuya,Tokyo."
5174,"When I read this article, It is interesting for me that gay or lesbian is accepted in many countries. So , I think that in Japan , they should be accepted though it is true that Japanese have the prejudice against them."
5175,I remembered this news too when I read this article.Bias to same-couple should decrease.
5176,"I think so ,too. It is important for us to have flexible thinking because it is bad that we are stereotyped ."
5177,"I think that this campaign is very good for both gay and straight. This is why we must pay attention to traffic signals traffic signals, so they are to attract the attention of all road users, both drivers and pedestrians. Probably people in public have few opportunities to know about gay. So, the interest in gay of people in public will be increased with an increase in this campaign. I think that it is important to deepen the understanding to gay before criticizing it."
5178,"I agree with the idea that we state the equality in traffic lights. It is true that new lights lead to waste of money. However, it's 'waste' has great importance, I think. People have started to take actions against discriminations such as gay. But people haven't changed their way of thinking completely. They feel some sense of incongruity in their mind. Therefore, I think it is important to take in true equality in daily life. New traffic lights are good start!"
5179,"I was surprised at this news.But I think this is a good idea to have various kinds of signal lights, because we all should be treated equal. And by such a signals I think those people could feel better!"
5180,I think this idea is so unique too. And this could get many people interested in those thing. But I'm not sure if we should install these system in Japan. Cause we don't like to change something.
5181,"I agree with your opinion. When I read this title, I was not able to imagine the contents of the sentence, too. If it was able to reduce accidents and also, people would be able to understand about gay more and more, it is very good idea of killing two birds with one stone, I think."
5182,"I think so ,too. To produce such traffic lights,our conscious are improved."
5183,"I think this idea is so clever. In this world, there are various people and these days many people know about them who are same-sex couples and they think it is normal. But in Japan, not all people feel so. To know about them is the most important, I think."
5184,I think that gay traffic lights are great. It's generally said that Japanese people understand little.Japanese government should install gay traffic lights for Japanese people to understand gay.
5185,"Although it's important to consider gender, for example bisexual or homosexual people and so on, it's not necessarily that pedestrian traffic lights depict various couples. I think there is another way."
5186,"I think so too. various people have various idea. When many people accept this idea, not only traffic problems but also social problems will go in a positive way."
5187,"I think so. I think we, Japanese people should consider various people, including homosexual people. We must need to discuss them."
5188,"I think so,too. Japan should depend on new energy."
5189,"Traffic lights of the same sex is an interesting idea. We should be the equal treatment to the all of the people. I do not know the plan of the equal treatment. If it plays in Japan, I do not see at the public, so I think Japan carries on it openly."
5190,I think so. This idea makes Japan more freely.
5191,I agree with you. Japan should promote many things about homosexuals. We cannot discuss various things without them in this society.
5192,"From this article, I knew that there were varieties of lights in the world for the first time. I'm familiar with Japanese one, which has only red, yellow and green, so I expect that I won't be able to cross the road in Vienna easily. Also, I noticed that world people thought about the equality of same-sex couples seriously. The way of promoting it is indirect, I feel. However, the way is also close to citizens and clear for them. In Japan, few people think about sexual problems seriously, so these lights may be installed at Japan, more Japanese people will have interest in it, I think."
5193,"I also think it is a good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. I hadn't thought about the problems seriously, too, so I felt I must have think more about them. The thought that same-sex couples are normal may be achieved father in the future, but it is certainly going ahead to good direction, I think."
5194,"I couldn't also believe there were these lights normally. The idea is difficult for me, too, but I think that it is good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. Taking account of both your opinion and my opinion, it is certain that homosexuals' opinions is most important."
5195,"If the autonomous car became popular, almost all of traffic accidents would decrease. It is nothing but good things. However I think we can't depend on the safety of the autonomous car completely.The most important thing is the safety for autonomous car to become popular."
5196,I think so too.The fact that there are a lot of nuclear power plants is so threatened people especially who live near them. So Japan have to find renewable.
5197,I agree with your opinion. Very rich should buy the paintings not for themselves but for everyone. It is when many people see it that the painting is valuable.
5198,"I think so too. Japanese people seem to be negative to homosexuality, so it cost us many time to get accustomed with the traffic signals."
5199,"I didn't came up with the advantage. Certainly if the autonomous car became popular, we can use it when we drink! I agree with your opinion."
5200,"I agree with your opinion. Certainly if autonomous became popular, many traffic accidents can decrease not only the accident of truck but also train or air plain. There are a lots advantage, so I hope the things which is written in this article realize early."
5201,I agree with your opinion. Certainly there are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.
5202,I can't imagine such money too. Very rich have so much money that they can monopolize the historically painting!
5203,"I agree with your opinion. These days the world accepts homosexuality, so Japan should try to be positive such an action."
5204,"That is very good idea to set up these traffic rights. I think these lights enable sexual minority people to live comfortable lives. Now, People who is gay or lesbian are completely accepted in Japan. This traffic lights should be adopted in Japan."
5205,I also think that it is desirable for these traffic light to be adopted in Japan. Maybe the idea that same-sex couple is normal will take root more in Japan.
5206,I also think that it is desirable for these traffic light to be adopted in Japan. Maybe the idea that same-sex couple is normal will take root more in Japan.
5207,I don't also know why Picasso's work is so high. But I think it is bad for valuable works to disappear back into private places because there are people who really want to see and enjoy works.
5208,"It was not until I read the article that I knew the positive movement to promote tolerance for gay. I think that the campaign is great because traffic lights are seen by a lot of people, so the signals will be a chance to make many people feel gay of a minority to be familiar."
5209,"I think this is good idea to change some peoples' think that same-sex couple is strange, but this traffic lights is for gay couples. There should be more traffic lights for lesbian couples."
5210,"I don't surprised at this article. Art cannot be priced by one, but it can be done with a lot of people and their competitive spirit, I think."
5211,"It is a very difficult issue. Autonomous car is very comfortable for us, but if its system broken, it can't be understand when accidents happen. Also, this can be said for drivers."
5212,"I agree with your idea. If autonomous driving can't be controlled, we have to drive cars alone."
5213,"I agree with your thought about renewable power,but there is a lot of problem to spread these power. So, I think the government should do the best to improve renewable power, but it is not done mind that this achievement become a little slowly."
5214,"Prices for items are sometimes decided not by historical value or technical value but by our emotion everywhere. This is natural thing, but we cannot feel this in our life."
5215,"I agree with your opinion that Japanese government should install signals like Vienna! But, if such signals appeared quickly in the street, we may feel out of place."
5216,"The young have the future, but elderly people have it too. So your idea is difficult to come true. And the government helps us a little."
5217,I tend to agree. There are a lot of energy resources while Japan has many nuclear power plants. It is high time to consider our energy.
5218,I tend to agree. Your opinion is very nice.
5219,I agree with you. Japan should promote so many things about homosexuals. So young people must discuss this topic.
5220,There are many gays every country. I tend to agree with Australian new traffic system. They appear in public place so that gays are admitted in true meanings. Japan also should appreciate same-sex marriage.
5221,"Fukushima disaster. I live in Saitama, but I experienced such big earthquake for the first time. It isn't an earthquake that much damage was taken out certainly,by nuclear power generation. However, Japan has a little energy resource. Japan needs the power of the nuclear power generation to do the former cultural life."
5222,I think so too. Japan needs using nuclear power. I believe the government will be forced to be available to the power.
5223,"I read the comment, and agree to your opinion. I was afraid of an autonomous driving car. Even if an accident is caused intentionally, a wrongdoer can blame a machine. I think there isn't supposed to be such incident."
5224,"I think a billionaire would like to be probably proud. He hopes the surrounding person will be surprised by his buying something no one can buy. When something he'd like to buy is expensive, so I think it needs to be Picasso's picture."
5225,"I agree with you. If they want to prevail the self-driving car, they should produce it perfectly. People will use that kind of cars when it is proved that self-driving cars are absolutely safe. I also want to take it if decent estimation is done."
5226,I agree with your opinion. I don't want Japan to depend on nuclear power. I think it is scary because of the accident in Fukushima. Many people in Japan may also think about it. The government has to look for another way which can produce as many power as nuclear plant.
5227,I have a friend who are a sexual minority. She is really good girl and kind for every one but she cannot marry legally in Japan. I want Japanese government to make a low that she can marry with who she really loves. So I agree with this campaign because every one gets a chance to understand them.
5228,"Thank you for your agreement. We cannot relate with this car market situation, but let's see carefully about this topic."
5229,"I saw such the traffic lights represented a gay couple for the first time. I was surprised and think very interesting topic. I think the form of loving is free and recently, other countries have a positive thinking for same-sex couples couples. The traffic lights are representing that world people think about same-sex couple deeply. In japan, a lot of people don't tend to think about that, and they are few chance that they can know same-sex couple. I also don't know about same-sex couple. I would like to study about this topic from this time."
5230,"I tend to agree your opinion. Japanese people don't have a chance thinking about same-sex couple and those people I think, so the government should try to do an action to promote this topic."
5231,"Your straight opinion is valuable . I also wonder this traffic light really promote equality. If this lights come to Japan, Japanese people confuse and may increase the accidents. They have become usual lights."
5232,"I can't forget the accident happened in Fukushima 2011. This year, many people injured and scared the fear of the nuclear power and some people suffering now. I knew the real danger of the nuclear power then. I think Japan should not use the nuclear power. There are many different ways to make electricity. The compatible of both of the safety and efficiency is difficult but we never bring such misery accidents 2011 in Japan. We would like to believe the government."
5233,I didn't notice that people who have a driver job will lose their job if this autonomous vehicles are used easily in the future. This problem is very serious. The progress of science will change our life and the system making this society I think.
5234,"I agree with your opinion. I also think about the form of loving is free. But in Japan, we do not often see those people than other countries. I think Japanese society do not have the society which those people can live easily. The Japanese society should make the society which such people are easy to live more. The activity to make traffic lights is very meaningful to make such a society. So Japan should try to do such activity like other countries."
5236,I agree with you. The lack of Japan is participation of gays. I also hope that they can marriage legally in Japan.
5237,"I think so too. For Japanese people, it is difficult to get a chance to know or understand them because many people don't make relationship with them. So, to get a chance to know spontaneously is important."
5238,I think so too. It is good thing that the famous works were bought by billionaires. There are no relationship between the owner and the value of the painting.
5239,"I agree with you! If I had so much money like the billionaire, I will use it for donate. It is better to use money for someone."
5240,"I also have my driver license. When I read your comment, I also wonder about the same thing. Probably many people disagree with and many trainers lost their jobs."
5241,I think so. And I concern about many people lose their jobs.
5242,"I think solving energy problems is difficult for us,but we must solve the problem. I think we depend on nuclear energy temporary,but we should replace the power on renewable energy. It is hard way but we must do."
5243,"This was interesting and important topic to think about. Nowadays, people are more and more concerned about their freedom and rights. These rights includes same sex marriage. This topic is still very sensitive but we have to face it."
5244,This news was kind of interesting but not valuable for me. I am not interested in any arts but the price of Picasso painting is astonishing. I wonder if it really has that much value.
5245,Self-driving is very interesting topic. Everyone is hoping that self-driving will be very valuable but still dangerous. It need to gain the credibility in the safety category in order to be spread around as general use.
5281,I thought it was more important to give eye contact for listener than perfect English speaking. And we have to speed control of speaking for listener's understanding. But of course I decided to study English more for my next presentation !
5298,"I felt very sad when I first heard about this news. Prime Minister is the top of Japan so at least he should be respected by people in Japan. However, the reality is so cruel that he got jeered by important anniversary day in Okinawa. I do not agree with the idea of changing Pacific Stance and constitution. Therefore, Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand."
5300,"It's difficult problem to solve whether for US troops to stay in Okinawa or to move away from Okinawa. Indeed it's heavy burden for Okinawa and people in Okinawa ask US troops to move away, but Okinawa is important place strategically. Especially, advance of China prove a great menace of Japan. Therefore we should discuss this problem."
5302,"I think so. Nuclear plans are cheaper than thermal plans. And they discharge lower carbon dioxide than thermal plans, but it's very very dangerous to use them. So we invent renewable energy as soon as possible."
5303,"I don't think that Japan can solve the gender problem by introducing the traffic lights. Although they may help us be aware of the problem, it can't be solved by only doing so. With this as a start, we have to know about gay people. Then I think we should understand that there are various values and accept them."
5304,"Surely, some people can't keep up with the new technology. It is obvious to see the smartphone for the elderly people. However, in some case, it is necessary to desert such people for the advance of new thing."
5305,"I think that the news is so good for us. If self-driving car is realized,we could protect a lot of accidents. Also, old people can drive to feel peace of mind"
5307,"I agree with your opinion. The Japanese government has to focus on the development of renewable energy more positively. In addition, at the same time, I think what we should do first is the saving of electricity."
5308,The news recognized me to be a lot of types thinking. I can't understand but I think I should receive these people and I should be effort to understand these people.
5309,"I think government should be more careful about the American bases in Okinawa. People in Okinawa must have suffered from the existence of American troops. When I went to Okinawa, I thought the sound of Osprey was noisy. It noises all day. Such an experience may increase the people's opposition to government. Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa."
5310,"I think this is a difficult problem, but I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. When I went there last year, I was surprised that there were so large US bases, so I wonder the noises of bases would affect local people's life. However, some local people make their living by working at shop for soldiers. So this is very complicated problem, but I think government should try to reduce it."
5312,"Nowadays, the discussion on Article 9 of the Constitution is incandescent in Japan. The Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Okinawa to deliver a speech in this serious time. According to the current poll, only 29% of respondents support the Abe's security bills, while 53% oppose. Okinawa is a region where the only ground battle has been carried out in Japan. Therefore, people living in Okinawa have higher interest in this speech. NHK apparently did not report that the Prime Minister Abe was openly heckled by people in there. The difference of the foreign media and Japanese media was so impressive for me. I think the Japanese media should tell true things directly."
5313,"I felt very sad too when I read this news because Prime Minister is elected by the Japanese, and he tries to realize our hopes. So I think we should not jeer him. If people have some complaint, they have to appeal in another way. I agree with your idea that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa."
5314,"I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for he aid."
5315,"I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people don't receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for he aid."
5316,"It is good your example to understand the Okinawa's present. I have heard the news that people suffered from a serious illness because of noise. In the past, Okinawa's people sued the country for their damage from the sound of airport in 'Futenma'. It is difficult problem, but the Japanese government should solve it immediately."
5317,"I didn't come up with your idea to increase driving without a licence. It is very interesting. However I think we can solve that problem . For example, we make the car which can not drive without scanning our licences."
5318,"I agree with your idea that employment opportunities will be decreased. I like to talk with the drivers when I use public transportation, so it is sad to lose the chance of talking."
5319,"I think this problem is very important for Japan. It has been just 70 years since the Second World War came to an end,but we should remember this war forever. When I was a junior high school student, I went to Okinawa on a school excursion. The main purpose of this excursion was not to commune with nature but to work the importance of peace. I was very surprised to realize the truth about this war. People in Okinawa told us to keep conveying how cruel it was, so we have a duty to think about it. I think it is natural that people tend to become emotional to listen Abe's speak. It is the evidence that people think about the peace in Japan seriously. To be indifferent is irresponsible. We must keep discussing the peace."
5320,"There are two things that we have to think. First, many renewable energy resources cost very high. Its already very high in Japan and introduction of renewable energy bumps it. We are in dramatic competitive world. In much countries, electricity expense is lower than Japan. Especially, North Korea and U.S. cost half as Japan. Second, nuclear technology is one of the highest technology now, and Japan has it. It's reasonable opinion that nuclear energy is dangerous, but it's not a smart way that stop and throw the nuclear energy. I think, Japan has to two things. First, developing good renewable energy cost reasonable price lower than thermal power plant. Second, developing safe nuclear energy."
5321,"I don't think so. First, we can't build many geothermal energy plant in Japan because most of places where can build geothermal energy plant are in national parks. Second, nuclear technology is very valuable and stopping development costs high."
5322,"I think your opinion doesn't reasonable. We can't stop spreading nuclear energy in the world. The number of Nuclear energy plants will increase 50% compare than 2011 (from IEA, 2012). Many of new plants will place in developing country. They really want to low cost energy resource and nuclear energy is almost only way to fill their demand. It's not a smart way that doing campaign to stop building nuclear energy. We have to develop safe nuclear energy as far as possible and build it on developing countries, first. And, at a time, we develop energy resources cost lower and lower. We have to do both of them."
5323,"I think it very good idea, but I feel something strange. If we respect all kind of gender and people, heterosexual people has to respected. Changing all traffic lights is too much."
5324,"There are so many U.S. bases in Okinawa. It's big problem, but they are really important for Japanese security. Umm. I think, biggest problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government as a Okinawa outlays. The amount of that money is amazingly 2.7 billion dollars(33 billion yen)in each year. Okinawa economics depend on this money. It's not good for Okinawa in long term, I mean Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong."
5325,"The active situation of art market is welcome news because the entire growth of art auction market is good for artists. For new comer artists, the valuation at auction has huge importance. It shows how they judged."
5326,"I think that Japanese people should think about a military base. This spring vacation, I visited Okinawa. Then I looked American base near the American village. I looked an airplane took off from the base. The airplane was very fast, so I think that it is very dangerous. Around the American base was very noisy. Therefore I think that the base gives harm to neighboring inhabitants. There are various opinions about the armed forces. However many people think that we have nothing to do with this problem. All in all, I strongly believe that all Japanese people should think about American bases in Okinawa."
5327,"I am opposed Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reinterpreting the pacifist constitution. However I agree to revise the constitution. It is necessary for two points of view, I think. First, if we leave the Constitution of Japan as it is, Article 9 of the Constitution is incompatible with right to collective self-defence. We should revise the Article 9 of the Constitution, and specify the existence and the part of the Self-Defense Force. If we reinterpret the pacifist constitution, it only makes vagueness about the Self-Defense Force. Second, to revise the constitution is not equal to plunging into war, and we have to be able to defend our country against the enemy. A speech full of high-sounding ideas lead to decline the strength of a nation."
5328,"I agree. Indeed autonomous cars are very charming. We can expect them to reduce accidents and the number of people who die in accident. However, there are some problem. For example, if a accident happen, we can't understand who makes mistake. And when we drive them, we can't understand whether we have to have a driver's license. So we should discuss them."
5329,"I think not waging is most important thing for Japan. If war will happen by reinterpreting the pacifist constitution, I opposed the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The war hurt many people not only Japanese troops but also American troops. We have to avoid this situation as far as possible."
5330,"Indeed, US air bases bring great harm to Okinawa and eliminating them may be the best way to remove that pain. However, they are key to Japanese defense capacity. In addition, it needs a enormous costs if we build a new substitute base, so removing the bases from Okinawa is very difficult, I think."
5331,"I disagree with you about how to capture the way of installing new traffic sign. I think we should be more tolerant of homosexuality, but I think it is odd to adopt gay illustration in traffic signs."
5332,"I think this is a difficult problem.If I ware people in Okinawa, I were angry with Abe like people in article. However, there are no place where the American bases is replaced. We should think a new solution to solve this problem."
5333,"I agree with your idea. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't recognized yet, but the gay traffic lights are the first step for tolerance for the same-sex marriage."
5334,"I thought that it is difficult problem when I heard this news. And I thought that people who live in Okinawa should not do only jeering Shinzo Abe, because this action doesn't make better solution. Japanese government should think better solution about this problem and think as people who live in Okinawa . For example, to move the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan."
5335,"As this article says, it is a very uncommon occurrence for a Japanese Prime Minister to be openly heckled by general public. I think it proves that the Okinawans' complaint reaches its peak. I think Abe should care about them more. I can't agree with recent Abe's strong stance on changing Japan's security arrangements. If he keep it, I think the approval rate will continue to fall."
5336,"I think, the reaction is reasonable for people in Okinawa. Okinawa has the terrible history. Many people still suffer from it. Besides, there are many U.S. military base and these are threatening their way of life. So, it is natural that they got angry to Abe's insensitive attitude. Japanese government should concern Okinawan more."
5337,"Okinawa has a lot of U.S. military bases. It's very serious and difficult problem. When I went to the Futenma base of Okinawa last year,I found that the residential area is very near the base.It is natural that people in Okinawa have dissatisfaction in the base and Abe's policy. Government should do their best."
5338,"Today, Okinawa has a lot of bases. It's natural that Okinawans should be angry for this. However, we shouldn't jeer in the reception marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of Okinawa.It is being a glorious. No matter how angry, they shouldn't bring their thinking in it."
5339,"Your are right in point of capturing feelings of Okinawans, but Japanese government has already concerned about Okinawans in a way that giving money. It's just money but 300 billion yen for each year. I think it so large support for them."
5340,"It is a serious problem that we must think about. I take a neutral position. I understand their worry about Abe's policy,while they are not allowed to jeer at Prime minister Shinzo Abe.Unless the two sides understand mutual thought, they will not make concessions."
5341,"Okinawa has the history that Okinawa was occupied by the US military. It is result of Japan's ability lack of defense Okinawa in WW2. After the war, US military thought Okinawa is the best place to display the power of USA in east Asia, so they have kept place their base though Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. Now, Okinawa is the forefront of Japan defense so there is no choice to remove all of the base but I think Japan and USA have to relieve Okinawa's burden. If we won't do so, Okinawa people's anger will be harsher."
5342,"It is very rude to jeer the Prime Minister at the formal ceremony. In Japan freedom of speech is secured in the Constitution of Japan, even the statement that 'Two newspaper in Okinawa should be dissolved.' by one private writer Hyakuta Naoki. But the jeer at the ceremony is blameworthy. It is illogical. No one is allowed to interrupt the ceremony. By the way, we should know that all people in Okinawa disagree with the relocation of a U.S. military base to Henoko. Rather, people in Henoko agree with that relocation. To cope with the threat of China, presence of U.S. military is necessary."
5343,"Reducing American bases significantly would be impossible, but it should reduce at least from current situation. To impose the burden on Okinawa is not good. Terrorism can not be prevented only there is a base. National defense should be reconsidered by a national."
5344,"I agree with you. We have to stop using the nuclear power little by little. In order to that, we should consider about it more carefully."
5345,"Under the present circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. In the Hatoyama administration of the Democratic Party, he said that 'to outside the prefecture at least.' I assumed that his remark made U.S. military base problem complicated. The government lost the trust of people in Okinawa. However, I think not only people in Okinawa but the Japanese should consider Japan's future seriously in the 70th anniversary of the end of the war."
5346,"It is very important and difficult issue. We should think it and we must not wage the war again. The Japan of today, people argue security-related legislation heatedly. I want the politicians to argue this issue carefully."
5347,I agree with you. They should avoid such action at the grave ceremony even though they have bad feeling for PM Abe. I think that there are many different ways that they claim their opinions.
5348,"I think it is not too much saying that the jeering at Abe in inevitable. Now his political policy is not agreed by many people. The lowest rate of the support for his cabinet shows this fact. Of course, battle of Okinawa ceremony is so important and should not be interrupted. But, the residents of Okinawa are the people who know it best. The locals who heckled Abe must also have known that. Maybe, they cannot help hitting dissatisfaction to Abe. They wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice."
5349,"I think jeering Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the ceremony is not good.I guess a complaint of people in Okinawa about noise of American army. And also,I take it granted for they get angry.However,such an action shouldn't be done in the formal ceremony.This news were reported all over the world. Japanese people would be thought as people without common sense."
5350,"The problem of moving US bases in Okinawa is difficult, because everyone don't allow move where they live in. I understand the people in Okinawa angry with Japanese government. That Mr.Abe appeared rattled the beer is good but the government should discuss them about this problem. And all Japanese people should know history of Okinawa and think about the US bases in future."
5351,"Your opinion is very interesting. In Japan, it is rare that people jeer at prime minister rudely at formal ceremony, as the news story said. But, in this case, the local's jeering at Abe is the natural reaction to the policy of present cabinet. And they have a purpose to show their anger to him by daring to heckle rudely him in the ceremony. In formal ceremony, Abe cannot ignore their voices. In addition, I think a little differently to you regarding the presence of U.S. military. Strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. So we must discuss it carefully."
5352,The problem that American bases should be moved to main land is very difficult to solve because Okinawa is imposed on too big burden but Okinawa is very important in view of military geography. Therefore Japanese government must convince the people of Okinawa that American bases are necessary to protect Japan.
5353,"This is very interesting idea showing Vienna's tolerance for gender. I also agreed it. Every time pedestrians walk through the crosswalks and see these new traffic lights, they will remember homosexual lovers. Then, whole society will become considerate. In addition, given that many 'likes' on Facebook, people are satisfied to have taken part in this project by paying taxes. So these should be introduced into other areas."
5354,"I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. If reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution is allowed, Japan would face a crisis of war. Though I have not experienced war, I understand how dreadful war is. Therefore, I never want to experience the war. We have to consider about this issue and try to find out the proper way to avoid the war."
5355,I agree with you. Not waging war is not only important for Japanese people but also people of other countries. We should find out the way of not allowing reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution.
5356,"You have a really good friend ! The other day, same-sex couples were allowed to marry legally in America. This is wonderful news for her ! Although Japan is conservative to this matters, I hope that she will be able to marry in Japan."
5357,"Surely, it is hard job to remove the U.S. bases from Okinawa. However, I strongly believe that we should put away the heavy burden of Okinawa by removing or reducing the bases."
5358,"I can understand Okinawan posture.They suffer many harms from U.S. troops.But I still think Japan need U.S. bases.If we eject them,Japan will be aim by neighbor Asian country,for example,Korea and China.We can get security and relief therefore we are protected by them.Only Japanese Self-Defense Forces can't protect there.So I agree with Abe's policy."
5359,"I disagree with Abe's quest to end Japan's strictly defensive posture recently because there are possibility that we will be involved in the dangerous situation. Even if he says that we won't be involved in the war , the situation of the future can't be known to anyone . Once the war brakes out, the cruelty of the war stays with people in that generation for long time. In addition, we should keep in mind that people in Okinawa have long been asked to carry a big burden for our security ."
5360,"I agree with your idea that Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government and it's not good for there in long term , but I think making new original industry by using given money is important now."
5361,One more thing that risk of self-driving car is hacking. Self-driving car is used huge IT technology and which means there are much more risks that hacking. Many specialists are warning that automotive companies have to take very strong measures for that of risks.
5362,"I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. Okinawa has serious and difficult problems about a lot of U.S. military bases. Under this circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. The people who live in Okinawa wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough."
5363,"I think so ,too.Japanese government is forced to take consideration both of people in Okinawa and American goverment.In this situation,making decision must be difficult.However,if they put off taking measures,the problem won't be solved."
5364,"I agree to your opnion.In fact,the impact of advertising may be big.However,this should not be done with much money.There must be better way."
5365,"I agree with you. We don't know about WWⅡ enough. Besides, understanding of history is different by each countries, that have caused many problems. So, we should learn and discuss our nation's history more deeply and mustn't forget the terrible affair."
5366,"I think so too. If nobody complain to Abe, our democracy break down. We shouldn't forget the main constituent of the politics is Japanese citizen. Not politician. 'Abe cannot ignore them' in your opinion is very important."
5367,"I understand how Okinawans feel, but at the same time I think it is not only Prime Minister Abe's fault. He is doing his best trying to reduce their burden as much as possible as he said in his speech. I hope Okinawans will stop jeering or complaining and instead, we, including Okinawans and others like me should focus on finding out solutions. I would like to think about why the American bases are still in Japan while nobody wants it in his neighborhood. And if we still need bases. where can be used?"
5368,"I was surprised at this news,too.I've been interested in art,so I can't imagine the feeling of the rich spending much money on arts.However,this is the rich that circulate economy."
5369,"This problem is so difficult. I think so, too. I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But, you know, this does not make things better. I think your opinion is not bad. but, where is the big island where people don't live. Every governor don't want to undertake American bases."
5370,"I'm all for your opinipn.Surely,Japan has few resources,so if we can use renewable energy,the problem of electricity will be soluted.And, nuclear power will be abolished completely."
5371,"Your experience in spring vacation is so nice. The laud sound of a military plane is understood by only people in Okinawa. so, your opinion is so persuasive. We Japanese should think this problem. Where is the best place of the base of America? Everyone doesn't know."
5372,"I think renewable energy is very important.It is safety for environment,and natural resources are not used.And also,by using it,nuclear power will be abolished completely. However,using it costs more money than usual.Solving the problem of electricity is not very easy."
5373,"Okinawa's bases are so many. I thought this is natural, but this is troublesome thing for the people in Okinawa. I think your opinion is correct. But, I think jeering isn't bad. I can understand what you think. I think Abe's attempt is bad, so raising an objection is natural."
5374,"I didn't think about that point.Surely,if we left driving to computer,we would not be able to drive by ourselves.Not only in driving but also in anything,we have to do as possible as you can."
5375,"I agree with your opinion. The relationship between Okinawa and the government won't be better. But, I think the relation ship between Okinawa and America is so strong. This isn't weak. So, what I want to say is replacing the bases of America can't be done. You said, 'Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough.' This is the very main opinion. Whether jeering is good or bad is not a problem."
5376,"Your opinions are correct, but my opinion is difficult to yours. I think revising the article 9 of Japanese constitution is needed. Now Japanese Self Defense Forces can't move freely by the constitution. I think this is so bad. revising constitution doesn't equals facing a crisis war."
5377,"I think so too. Many people of Okinawa want to remove the bases, but people in other prefectures also refuse them. However, we cannot easily remove them because the US bases are important to national defense. We should consider this issue by the entire nation."
5378,"I haven't thought about homosexual couples well.These days,these couples have not been discriminated.However,understanding of them is not still enough.We have to know them more."
5379,"I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But,I think this does not make things better. Many people say, 'Replacing the bases of America is needed.!' But, I want to say 'where is such a place?' Every governor don't want to undertake such a military base. Also, I think revising article 9 is needed. I think the country which don't have military and the country which can't have military is different. We Japanese must have responsibility of international society. For example, Japanese Self Defense Forces(JSDF)can move if the transportation is absolutely safe. This is so bad. So, we should revise the constitution."
5380,"I think, people complain of not only noise but also more things. This problem isn't so simple. There are many fears about environment, crime by the US soldier, safety of the Osprey, and so on. We should understand the issue of the US bases in Okinawa more."
5381,"When I read the news, I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly.Of course,I know that people in Okinawa had caught pain and sorrow in WW2.But reproaching to Abe is not produce any good result.And government should be more considerate of people in Okinawa, particularly U.S.military base.People in Okinawa and government should more compromise."
5382,"I'm very surprised at hearing the news. It's generally said that Japanese people don't express our mind clearly,especially in politics.however,in this news,Okinawans express their mind strongly.I think it's great because democracy is protected by positive participation of civilians. But then this means like jeering others is unsuitable.I suggest that civilians participate politics positively and peacefully."
5383,"I felt sad too when I heard about this news.But when it comes to change the constitution, I think people pay attention too much article 9.I think plunged into war is against and agree that Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand, but people should be flexible."
5384,I think Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa too. U.S. military base should move to abroad near by Japan.placing the military base is mistaken utilitarianism for people in Okinawa.
5385,I worry about Okinawa people may think Japanese government is making light of their prefecture . Okinawa people have pride as Okinawan and Japanese. We have to consider the complex feeling of them.
5386,"I want to understand the Okinawans' feelings, but I think those behavior were so rude to the Prime Minister. If they wanted to insist their opinions, they had to have a sense of occasion. Japanese people must not forget the history of the Battle of Okinawa. However, when we talk about it or try to solve problems relative to the Battle of Okinawa, we have to deal calmly with it."
5387,I agree your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong.Okinawa should not rely on U.S. military base forever.
5388,"I agree with a part of your opinion, but I do not think that the Prime Minister was elected by the Japanese. If all or most of the Japanese people hoped that Mr. Abe become a Prime Minister, so many people do not jeer him. His policy is been criticizing by many Japanese from long ago. That is a serious problem. I think it is also a problem that many young people are not interested in the Japanese politics. Therefore, the Prime Minister and the Japanese citizen have to make a better policy for the future in Japan."
5389,The point you focused is interesting. Should a license system be needed for autonomous car? This is a issue we have to think.
5390,I agree with you . But I have some difference opinion from yours. When I read this archive I thought it can be on traffic Jim by self driving . Of course traffic accident decrease .
5391,"The Battle of Okinawa is the big matter which Okinawa people can't forget. That evidences have existed in Okinawa. I think that the most biggest negative legacy is USA camps. these camps are danger of Okinawa and support for Okinawa economy. If Okinawa need USA camps is issue that Okinawa should decide, but I want that Okinawa people live happily and safety. Finally, I think all of Japanese should not forget the Battle of Okinawa and that war."
5392,"I am against an opinion of Abe. I worry about Okinawan, so I empathize Kakazu. He said ' It was innocent civilians who suffered'. I think that is right. In the first place, I dislike Abe's think in recent. I don't want to go war, so we must not do war. Now, we think this issue."
5393,I was surprised to read this article. I have been thinking that Japanese people don't express their feelings strongly in public. I think that means they cant stand it any more.we should reconsider this matter seriously.
5394,I think so. Jeering produce nothing. There are possibility to occur emotional confront between jeering people and jeered people. They should discuss that issue calmly.
5395,"I think U.S.'s Okinawa bases should be moved. Of course, historically,Okinawa was not belong to Japan and Japan conquered Okinawa at war. In the same way, U.S. conquered Okinawa at WWⅡ. Therefore the problem of U.S.bases is partly inevitable. However people in Okinawa is suffered from the problems which U.S. bases cause. The government should consider the people in Okinawa at the best."
5396,I think your opinion is true! This news is very difficult problem. I dislike Abe's opinion. He doesn't make new better solution. His opinion jeer Okinawan. I understand Kakazu's objects.
5397,"I heard this news, I think that it is difficult problem. I think We decrease burden of Okinawan. Replacing the bases of America is needed. This sentence is very good!! Your opinion is very interesting and true! I talk about this problem with you."
5398,"I can understand that people in Okinawa criticize the policy by Prime Minister Abe. This is because the people living in Okinawa have had a very unbearable experience since World War II was finished.But we cannot answer where we should let a US base in Okinawa move. Even if the government moves the base to other areas of Japan, this isn't the truth solution since the local people living there start to criticize the government. I think that I cannot but have people living in Okinawa endure this problem until Japanese Government succeeds in negotiations with the U.S. Government."
5399,"I feel it difficult to move US military facilities from Okinawa at the moment. Indeed they must be moved from Okinawa,but it can't be solved between only the Japanese government and Okinawa Prefecture.Maintaining the good relationship with America is also important.And the Japanese government has not found new places to move them yet. In any case,I think,Abe should restore Okinawans' trust and attempt to repair the relationship with Okinawa Prefecture."
5400,"I think that criticism for government should be done in appropriate way. Even if the insistence is right, they should not say in formal ceremony, because it is annoyance for many people who want to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of the battle of Okinawa."
5401,"When I read this article first, I that the Okinawans are imposed on a big burden. At the same time I thought that this problem was a difficult problem to be concerned with both diplomatic problem with the United States and problems of the domestic administration called the correspondence to the objection of citizens of Okinawa and inhabitants of other base laying proposed sites."
5402,I also think it is very difficult issue. It's time for us to reconsider it seriously.
5403,"Your opinion is definitely sure. But I think people in Okinawa make a profit too. When I tripped to Okinawa, I was taught by local people that many people work at the store near American bases, and if they were reduced,their jobs were reduced too."
5404,"I think so, . Nothing is settled only by jeering and thinks that the situation does not advance at all. I think that the people in Okinawa should take a little more political method."
5405,"Your opinion is definitely sure. But think the right of collective self-defense should be permitted because it is permitted in public international law. Quite a lot of countries have the right now, but almost of them do not go to war. I think Japan will not go to war either as soon as it is permitted."
5406,I agree with you. Japanese people should think about gay culture. Japanese people have prejudice idea about gay culture. Marriage of LGBT officially allowed in all states in the US. I believe that it should be allowed in Japan.
5407,"I agree with you. As a same-sex marriage was permitted in U.S.,the kind of tolerance should be permitted all over the world."
5408,"I agree with you. I cannot understand why people want Picasso's picture to pay so much, too. However rich people is enviable."
5409,"I agree with you. I was very surprised when I read this article. I think that rich people should use their money for other way. For example, to save the people of developing countries. We should think about usage of the money."
5410,Your opinion is very interesting. We should think about driving license. I think we should think about drink-driving. I hope that traffic accidents decrease.
5411,"I am against war. I am from Hiroshima. So, I learned about terror of war when I was an elementary student. Not only people in Hiroshima but also people in Okinawa Learned it. Therefore, people in Okinawa don't want there to be another war. If Abe pushes ahead with plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution by all means, he must explain the safety of it to the Japanese people."
5412,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. Indeed people in Okinawa are very angry about government action. But they have to be more serene."
5413,"I agree with you. I really looked the US base in Okinawa, I think that it heavy burden for people who live in Okinawa. However US bases are important for diplomatic relationship. We should think about this problem carefully."
5414,"I think so. This is difficult problem, so we should consider new solutions to solve this problem."
5415,"Thank you. I can't say that the best place because I don't know about this problem. I think that other people don't think about this problem, too. Therefore Japanese government should make opportunities to think."
5416,I agree with you. This is very difficult problem. However we should think about this problem. I really looked US base in Okinawa and I feel that it was very dangerous. I think that Japanese people should go to Okinawa and look US bases really.
5417,"It is ceremony to give a silent prayer to a person killed in battle of Okinawa. They shouldn't have taken a subject of the timely politics and discussed about it, much less jeer.I think that the citizens of Okinawa should have shown memorial will to a person killed in the war. The problem of the base transference establishes the place elsewhere and should be argued ."
5418,I agree with your opinion. I think they should have acted after having considered how their actions are considered according to others. They might be better if they were calmer.
5419,"It is true that Okinawa has burden and must be relived. However, jeering is not smart. They should talk more carefully."
5420,I partly agree with you. But Mr.Abe don't think about only Americans. He must think about Japanese too.
5421,I agree with you. Keeping peace is very important. And we must discuss how peace is kept and we should do.
5422,I think so. Japanese government must consider both of people in Okinawa and the USA. This problem is not only about people in Okinawa but also for all Japanese people.
5423,I agree with you. The problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government. And I don't how much money they are given. I know just now! thank you!
5424,"Your experience is so persuasive! If my house were near the base, I might feel fear. We must think about the current Okinawa people's feeling,"
5426,I agree with you. They must have responsibility people who own much property.
5430,"I think that it's a very difficult problems,too. I oppose Abe's policy. Why does he do such a. thing! And American military affairs should not only the problem of Okinawa."
5431,"I think this problem is very difficult. To solve this problem, it is necessary to agree by most of Japanese. We have to think what to do for this problem."
5432,I think Okinawans' replay is very good. Because they can speak freely to politician. This country is liberal.
5433,I think Abe's policy is selfish. Abe must think Okinawan people and environment.
5434,"I think Japanese people who do not criticise people in public got angry and,jeered meant misery of people in Okinawa."
5436,"I was very interested when I first read this news. Recently, allowance of homosexual has became the major topic in the world including America and Japan. Shibuya recently allowed homosexual marriage in the prefecture law. In addition, I found the way they connected road lights and homosexual problem very innovative. I think it is the first attempt to do it. I hope this will success to increase the awareness about both homosexual and road safety."
5440,"I don't think that the government needs to advance the legislation toward the spread of self-driving cars. However, there are things to be done before those cars spread. First, security of them should be enhanced more. Then, the government has to make a law to clarify where responsibility lies when traffic accidents occur due to an error of self-driving cars. If these conditions are satisfied, I think the government don't need to legislate the spread of them."
5441,"I felt it was so difficult to solve the problem of the U.S. army in Okinawa after all. The problem has been discussed for a long time, but still now, Japanese people and the government push the problem onto only Okinawa. Therefore, we have to know about the present situation there and insist our opinions strongly. For example, with SNS, we can criticize and argue with people all over the world about the problem. Many criticisms can move Japanese government and also American one, I hope."
5442,"Shinzo Abe is in a very difficult position now. Japanese usually don't do the jeering like this so Okinawans have a great frustration, I think. This problem is treated as a problem of Okinawa and our government but this is a problem of all of Japanese people. This recognition is important."
5443,"I agree with you. Most Japanese tend to think it is a problem of Okinawa, but they should think it is a problem of whole Japan."
5448,"I agree with you. Now, it may be necessary for us to use nuclear power, but we should think about the way that we don't have to use it."
5449,"I agree with you. I think so, too. Indeed, There will be a lot of arguments about safety problem self-driving cars have, but they will be came true someday."
5452,"I agree with you. I were also angry with Prime Minister Abe's idea, if I lived in Okinawa. However, if we think of nothing but our own interests, we can't decide how to do from now on. So this is a really difficult problem."
5453,I agree with your opinion. Asking the public opinion is very important if we make a big decision such as this case.
5454,"I think so, too. Tax should be used more useful for people who live in the country."
5455,"This problem will take along time to solve, but I think New Zealanders shouldn't be hurry. Country flag is a symbol of the country and changing it is so big problem that they should think carefully and discuss deeply."
5456,"I think so, too. Japan should change its too exclusive attitude."
5459,"You are right. Knowledge makes understanding,and understanding makes tolerance."
5460,"Yes,we should think about the problem more."
5461,"I don't think so.There is no right needed to have more money than others do,and no way to spend money is morally better than other ways are."
5462,I see your point.I also think the current situation where only rich people can fully enjoy this kind of art is not desirable.Who can buy art?Who can own?
5463,"So,what is the trouble?Will perfect autonomous vehicles need license?I cannot see what you mean."
5464,I totally agree with you.Several pieces of legislation should precede turning self-driving to practical use.What an important point!I couldn't realize such a thing...
5465,"I partially agree with you. Strictly speaking, jeering about political issue is not suitable at the solemn memorial service. So people might have to mind their languages. However I can understand their feelings. They may be too dissatisfied about the American military bases in Okinawa to behave in a disciplined manner. Even if the way was wrong, their strong feelings must have reached Abe. I think it was valuable thing."
5466,"Your argument is clear,and writing is persuasive.I didn't think of the possibility of self-driving cars reducing or solving a problem like traffic jam.This is very interesting point."
5467,"Your point is partly unclear to me.Why will children with no driving skills getting to be interested in operating be viewed as a problem?Of course, self-driving cars may not be perfect in avoiding accidents.But how can children make serious social issue?"
5468,"I was also very surprised to read this news article. Some people who buy the work of arts for such a too expensive price regard the work as the way of investment, I think."
5471,"I also think they appealed their argument in an improper way,and they should have taken other one,if they really want their opinion appreciated and supported by the general public.They should take into account the fact that every opinion is evaluated with images they make when they represent it. Anyway,we Japanese did elected Mr.Abe indirectly,and we have responsibility to continue criticizing what he does.And I think he manages relatively well in many fields so far except for the present constitutional question,considering the fact that no politician could make all the current Japanese political problems solved completely."
5472,This problem is so difficult for America and Japan. The best way I think is American's Army leave Okinawa to remove Okinawa's dissatisfaction. However it is hard to realize this idea because of America's pressure. I think any prime minister maybe can't find perfect answer.
5473,"I agree with you.We have to know the president, Okinawa's and japan's situation for the future."
5474,"I think Shinzo Abe should think more deeply about the problem of Okinawa and America. To reduce a big burden for people of Okinawa, he and us have to think about the solution. I think to solve the problem completely is very difficult, but we should do in the position of people of Okinawa. So we do, Okinawan people's frustration and anger will be reduced a little bit about the problem."
5477,Yes! This event is very interested news! Japan should suggest many idea for gay or LGBT or etc... However people recognized a gay in Shibuya! This event support by Shinzo Abe's wife! The day when a gay is recognized in Japan is not far.
5479,"These days, more and more Japanese people especially young people lost interest toward politics. According to this article, prime minister Abe isn't respected. I guess we should be interested in politics and our prime minister's action, then will find new ideas how to deal with this matter."
5480,"I think the fact that billionaires buy and own valuable pictures is not blameworthy thing in itself. Because there is no rule to prohibit from doing so. However I can't understand their senses of values to pay millions dollars for a painting. I think there is another better way to use them. In addition, even if the billionaires buy famous paintings, I want the billionaires to provide the general with public periodic opportunities to put the masterpieces on view."
5481,"I think the fact that billionaires buy and own valuable pictures is not blameworthy thing in itself. Because there is no rule to prohibit from doing so. However I can't understand their senses of values to pay millions of dollars for a painting. I think there is another better way to use them. In addition, I want them to provide the general with public opportunities to display the masterpieces."
5482,"This problem is very difficult but all Japanese people have to think about this as a Japanese people. I think the problem happened from the history state will not solve completely. Many people have various thinking about. Abe should think more carefully about this problem. Now, the relation between America and Japan is good and they should help each other for the future. Also, we should think about Okinawa people mainly. Their pain may have continued long time."
5486,"The population of the truck driver decreases year by year, and the aging advances, too. The times when self-driving cars is necessary may be going to come…"
5487,"I think so, too. We cannot but cover electricity with nuclear power generation until a convincing alternative energy to turn into nuclear is developed."
5488,"I was surprised, too! If there is the money for it, do you want to spend it for other things? However, the life to bet all on for art may not be bad…"
5489,"It is a good idea! However, the interest in LGBT of people may fade when signals of LGBT increase and come common. I think that an idea with any other topicality of the signal is necessary."
5490,"I think so, too. In rivalry with each other, the discussion with cursing and jeering cannot produce good conclusions. I want them to perform a calm and careful discussion."
5492,"As for the homosexuality, there are still a lot of people that the 'abnormality' 'perversion' word 'to be metamorphic' appears on the head. In addition, there is really the person pouring such words for a homosexual. However, in the first place a human being is not a simple animal that an object to turn love to is limited to the opposite sex. I think that neighboring people should understand such a thing."
5493,"I think this problem is difficult.But I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. I think that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa."
5494,It is difficult to solve the problem.But Prime minister Shinzo Abe didn't enough explain.the point is so bad and he should more effort to be understanding the problem .
5495,"I think that it is complicated problem. As you know, we don't want to be included in a war, but Japan has to solve another problem, American military base in Okinawa. Mr. Abe said that we should reduce the difficulty of American base by changing our constitution. I suppose that it is the last way we decide. It is risky to change the constitution. To sum up, we had better not change the constitution. Saved by The USA is the best way."
5496,"I agree with you. Certainly, we have not to blame heavy burden on only Okinawa but there is very important place for Japan's defense strategically. In the future, China's act of aggression will more harsher than now I think. We can't defense our nation only self-defense forces so we have to cooperation with US military and they need to place the base in Okinawa. We must discuss about this problem carefully."
5497,"I see. It is question for us why Australian people can accept these strange traffic light. In Japan, it is unbelief to use these light and accept our society but we have to change these strange sense of value to make our society various."
5499,"I also think that this problem is difficult. I think we should take away heavy burden of Okinawa, but US troops are necessary for Japan. If we move this into Honshu, the people in the land will disapprove. We should think about this problem carefully."
5500,I agree with your idea. This age is not same as that of old days. We should follow any situation as time passed. There are a lot of people who don't have the same idea as we about sex. We ought to receive them for their comfortable life.
5501,"I agree with you. There are many elderly people who can work even if they are over 60 years old. If government allow them to work for a long period, dept in Japan will be decreased even a little. Japanese government should think about this problem for our future."
5503,"I also think much money has other ways to be used for. However,though I don't know the worth of arts, they may have something which fascinates people."
5505,"I think the problem about US troops in Okinawa is very difficult issue. Prime minister Abe's determination is not in accordance with Okinawa residents' views, so it was natural that Abe was jeered by people in public. they have rights to insist their opinions to him. But the top man in Japan should not be like this situation people have big discontent of dissatisfaction. Japanese people have to think more about the Okinawa problem"
5506,I agree with your opinion. Japanese young people should have more interests toward Japanese politics and have more knowledge and opinion to politics. Young people can active to insist their opinion with more liveliness than older people. Young people's activity can change Japanese politics.
5508,"I agree with you. I also cannot judge whether it is reasonable of too expensive because I have poor knowledge about the painting. And as you wrote, I think many people should see these paintings freely."
5520,"I mostly agree with your opinion, but all nuclear power shouldn't be shut at the same time. To be sure, it's possible to stop the some of all. In my opinion, we are good enough developing stable and ecological power when some of all plants is shut."
5521,I agree with your opinion. We can not discuss social problem without gay problem. Japanese people do not know a lot about gay people and have a prejudice. So these traffic lights might be really good opportunity to think about gay people.
5523,"I agree with you. This movement is efficient because almost everyone looks signals every day. But, I worry that some look the lights curiously and just for fun. I hope same -sex marriage is allowed in Japan."
5524,"I partially agree with you. I sympathize with people in Okinawa. However,they should not shout 'Go home!' in such a formal ceremony. I think the discussion with jeering get serious the relationship between Okinawa and the government."
5525,"I felt sad when I read this article, because I think there are some another ways to convey thoughts. We Japanese should not jeer him. I think that problem is so difficult, so Japan should consult carefully."
5526,"I agree with you. This problem is so difficult, so Abe should think more deeply and carefully about it too. And we must be interested in that problem and think deeply too."
5527,"I think so. This technology surprised us. Especially I sympathized the point you think this topic is interesting; autonomous cars must be safety drive more than people. You think if autonomous cars become the reality, we can drink alcohol when we ride it. Maybe it is true. But if these cars incorporate hand-powered driving system, I fear the people drinking alcohol convert driving system with drunk thinking."
5529,I agree with you. I could not notice what employment opportunities will be decreased. I think self-driving has both merit and demerit.
5530,I agree with you. Japan rely the nuclear power and it is rational. But Japanese government should check nuclear power plant more severe because it convinces Japanese citizens of importance of nuclear power. And I sometimes think Japan relied it too much in the past.
5531,I agree with you. I think increase of earthquakes make returning nuclear power more risky and make Japanese anxious too. Not only developer or government also we think about renewable energy.
5533,"I agree. Nuclear power risks too much for us. Through Fukushima disaster, we grasped the fact that nuclear power generate might cause very dangerous accident. Japanese people have no reasons to persist only nuclear."
5534,Your idea is interesting for me. But I think we should not too trust self-driving car. We cannot say machine trouble is never happened. We have to pay attention to situation of driving at least a little.
5536,"Your opinion interested for me. As you say, in this news, Japanese people who usually can't express their mind express their feeling clearly for Abe. I think it is not a little the number of Japanese people who have a strong mind or thinking for a political problem."
5539,"I agree with your opinion. People in Okinawa have suffered from American troops. But Japanese people who do not understand the feeling and the suffering. I have not been there. I can not feel their burden. Your story about the people of Okinawa is real voice. I think their burden is much more big than we expect. So we are same the Japanese, we also think about solution to reduce their burden."
5540,"I agree with your opinion. It is so useful a way to express my opinion by using SNS such as LINE and Twitter since people all over the world utilize it. But if you comment on the web,you should be careful not to criticise the Japanese government for the USA military base in Okinawa recklessly. I can understand a little that Japanese government has made a effort to remove Okinawa's burden by continuing to negotiate with the USA. It is certain that the negotiation between Japan and USA hasn't improved for about 60 years and people in Okinawa are frustrated for a long time.But,I think that we should expect the Abe Administration make more effort to solve the problem.What we can do to support the Japanese government is not only criticize Abe's policy but also believe.However,we need to watch whether the Japanese prime minister pursues proper diplomatic policies."
5541,I agree. I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly.
5542,I think they have to be more serene.they shouldn't jeer unduly.
5543,I agree with you.Homosexuals are now discriminated in Japanese society. People should accept that difference of preference.
5544,"I don't know that there are some kinds of traffic rights that give people messages to think about homosexual until finish reading this article. I think these kinds of traffic rights are interesting and enable people to think about diversity of sexual reference.People often despise homosexual people. That may be a infringement of human rights.Thereffore,people should accept homosexuality."
5545,I gave way to my anger to Abe's attitude to Okinawans when I finished reading this article.Japanese government should make a consultations on the matter of American military bases.Japanese government sticks to their beliefs.That isn't good attitude to another government.I think what is important is not how make Americans satisfied but Japanese satisfied.
5547,"I understand your opinion and I don't want to experience the war,too. But,for example,the collective right to self-defense which Abe is going ahead with is important diplomatic card. Approving it could deterrent for other countries. Accordingly,we cannot necessarily say revising the pacifist constitution is wrong."
5548,"Realizing what Google was inventing autonomous cars, I surprised that the cars are developed to such a step. But I think autonomous cars are two-edged swords.Certainly, if all cars become automatic operating, car accidents which are caused by human's carelessness will decline dramatically. However I'm afraid of this future because people in case of system failure, they'll not able to avoid accidents by their own ability."
5549,"I agree with your opinion. If buyers are really like want paintings,it is no problem. But that may increases the likelihood that we cannot appreciate them. If possible,I want paintings owned by public museums"
5550,"I think it could be the good opportunity that we accept LGBT,too. I want this trial introduced in Japan.Unique ideas like this are easy to be paid attention."
5551,"Increasing people not having the license may certainly be going to be the big problem. When automobile car is out of order, they can't do nothing. If it is emergency or being delayed, we will regret for not having the license."
5552,"I agree with you. Even if the nuclear power plant supply electricity cheaply,we shouldn't use it because we cannot quite control it with current technology.As you say,the price people in Fukushima paid in Fukushima disaster was too big. Japan should change the way to generate electricity for environment and ourselves."
5554,"I am impressed with your opinion and agree with you. Until I read it, I didn't understand this picture's value. Because I didn't think this picture's side as history. I think we should spread cultures and what they tells. The riches shouldn't keep it to themselves."
5558,I think people around the world pays attention to this topic because U.S. Supreme Court judged same-sex marriage is reasonable right in the Constitution. I think the world is in the stream judging homosexual love. But some people opposes it because of religion and etc. Maybe it will be a long time to judge homosexual around the world. Love doesn't relate to sex.
5560,"I disagree with your opinion for some reasons. It is true that some people say that strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. However, China is going into the South China Sea and conflicting with the Philippines. And I think that China is unworthy of discussing. In fact, The Chinese Communist Party is infringing on rights of people in Tibet and Uighur. Therefore China is untrustworthy."
5562,"I agree with you. I'm interested in pictures such as Picasso, too. I hope billionaires and private investors should understand the real worth of art instead of the worth for investment."
5563,"I agree with you. Japan mustn't break the relation to America by any means. But Japanese government mustn't ignore Okinawan opinion because Japanese government adopt parliamentary system of government. I think Japanese opinion isn't definite, so American government doubt Japanese attitude. My opinion is Japan shouldn't lose bases from Japan."
5565,"Your opinion made me think about this news more deeply! Indeed they may induce accidents. But I don't agree with your thought that they are not related to promotion of equality. By the mass media or SNS, these unique traffic rights will become a topic of conversation. This is great step."
5566,"I also think that autonomous cars can be effective resolution of two sides; reducing traffic accidents and traffic jams. The former includes fatalities, the latter consumption of the gasoline, as you said. So these cars are good for people and environment."
5567,"I think we shouldn't happen war and know about W.W.Ⅱ, too. But this problem isn't easy to solve. If neighbor countries attack Japan, we only fight to defend Japan. All the country don't have principle of peace. So Japan must deploy army."
5568,"I agree with you. I think we must keep to remember WWⅡ, too. And we should study the war in detail and tell future generations. About the problem of US based in Okinawa, we must think it steady rather than other people's affairs."
5575,"I think so, too. Japan should change the way to generate electricity because we don't have enough technology to use safely nuclear power at present. I hope our life that don't count on atomic power comes true some day!"
5582,"Kanji is Japanese traditional culture. I started to learn Kanji when I was elementary school student and now I sometimes study it for Kanji Kentei. However when I study Kanji, I feel that I cannot write Kanji compared with the past. In Japanese, a cellular phone is commonplace. Therefore people don't write letter and use the e-mail service. When we use the cellular phone, we don't write Kanji, so we cannot write Kanji. However Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we have to protect this culture. I think the one of sentences using a kanji is easy to understand meaning of the sentences. Furthermore, Kanji is used everyplace in Japan, so we are inconvenience if we can't use kanji. Therefore we must study Kanji."
5583,"I agree with you. I think Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should protect it. Increasing the opportunity to write Kanji is nice idea. We have to use Kanji more positive. It isn't better to depend on a PC and smart phone. We should write Kanji with own hands. If we use Kanji, we can understand the meaning of the word easily. I think that Kanji is wonderful. I decide to study Kanji more."
5587,"I also think so. It is true that Self driving car is very convenient and help many people who can't drive but If it happens accident,it's responsibility is whose? Until this problem is resolved,Self driving car should be not introduced"
5588,"I think your idea is best way.We must renounce nuclear power in accountance for Fukushima tragedy. But Now,Nuclear power accounts for 20% in Japanese electricity and Japan can't renounce nuclear power if future is like now. Therefore japan must invent new energy."
5589,"Before I read this comment,I thought Japan should promote renewable power but I didn't think about How to promote renewable power. Therefore Your comment show me how to promote renewable power."
5591,I agree you. Japanese people don't have opportunities that they think about gay and gay is not accepted. Therefore we should introduce this gay and traffic light and attract attention.
5592,"When I knew this news, I am high school student. Many Korean high school students were died by this accident. So I am shocked. I think captain should have helped to passenger. But he was escaped from Sewol. I was disappointed of it."
5594,"I agree with you. I often use internet for watching movie on YouTube and listening music. However I don't know it is an illegal act. A lot of people use internet for watching movies and listening music like me. Almost people does not download movies and music. It's difficult to understand a law for the general people, so I think it's better to increase more chances to learn a law."
5595,"I think so too. If I start work very hard now, I can not pay for this picture. So I can not believe this picture's value."
5598,"Certainly, we have freedom of speech in Japan, but jeering at the Prime Minister at the official ceremony should be forbidden. We have rights to elect our representative. If we think Abe is not right, we can remove him for the Prime Minister. If our freedom of speech were not guaranteed such as China, we could jeer at, strike, and kick the Prime Minister."
5599,"Certainly, using SNS and discussing the issue with people worldwide is very important and worthy of promoting. However, at the same time, we must improve our media literacy. On Twitter we can often see people who are deceived by information. We have to know that some powerful people can benefit if we are deceived by information on the Internet."
5600,"To begin with, people in Okinawa (who have Japanese nationality) are Japanese. You distinguish Japanese people from people in Okinawa. It is very wrong. Japanese people and people in Okinawa have the same rights as Japanese nationality. We Japanese should cooperate together to cope with the changing situation in East Asia."
5601,"I agree that it is a difficult issue to be discussed when considering of both Japanese people and relationship with the United States. I think it is natural for Japanese people to pay a lot of attention for the Article 9 because nobody want our country to be involved in a war. However, I understand it is not right to make Okinawa taking all the burdens. People should think from wider perspectives."
5603,"I agree with your opinion about last sentences especially. Today, the public opinion in Japan is still strict for homosexual. Although I don't know this ideology is right, this ideology is received acceptance for the world more."
5612,"I agree with your opinion.You gave a good example.I think Noise problem is important point, too. There is the fact that people which live in Okinawa can't live comfortably because of noise by American based. So, Japanese government should solve it."
5616,Our generations are being forgotten the memory of World War Ⅱ . We must not forget it. We have a duty which tell future generations because it will teach important of peace to us. We must discuss we should do to protect peace.
5617,"When our position changes, our feelings and opinions will also change. As Japanese nationality, I support the construction of a new U.S. base. Today the world is changing. China is threatening the neighbor's countries such as Japan. Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity."
5618,"You were so splendid to go to Futenma base. As the residential area is near the base, the danger of accidents is left. To remove the danger, the construction of a new U.S. base to Henoko should be advanced."
5619,"I agree with your opinion. I think to spend money to buy expensive arts is not necessary, too. Like you said, the money should be used by other aspects.I think billionaires should donate money to developing countries."
5622,I think that the Japanese should give an opposite opinion to the Government aloud. And to express an opposite will into the world helps to change the present conditions . But I also think that jeering in the ceremony is not good.
5623,No one wants to allow the U.S. bases in the place where they lives.So the problem of moving U.S. bases is difficult. People of Okinawa may feel that they have no friend in Japan.We should make maximum efforts to reduce a burden of Okinawa as a same Japanese.
5624,"I agree with your opinion. It is important to discuss the problem,thereby it will resolve."
5625,"I imagined the world that autonomous cars are spread. When an accident happened, who takes responsibility for the accident? There is a problem in such an area as well as safety.If the problems can be settled, we should make it widely available."
5626,"I agree with you up to a point, but I think how to use money is the right for each person. So rich persons needn't use their money for charitable work,but their money shouldn't be used contrary to the public profit like the study of Picasso's painting in this case. They need think carefully about the effect of using their money by situation."
5628,"However I had known the fact that there are a lot of American bases in Okinawa, I was surprised at what no less than 70% of those are. I think Japanese government force Okinawa to bear burdens which is too heavy. Of course, I know that there are no room to set bases in other prefectures, too, though I believe the government must improve this state."
5629,"I think so too. If autonomous cars infiltrate our life, we will be able to live comfortably. However, It makes new risks."
5630,"I agree with your opinion. In this aging society, the accidents caused by elderly people will increase. But most elderly person can use only easy sytem.The companies should make easy and safety system. To help the people with a disability is wonderful!"
5631,"I agree with your opinion.Since China develops recently, it is no use insisting that it is necessary to allow US troops to stay in Okinawa. However,it is important to reduce heavy burden. We must think about it seriously."
5632,"I don't think so. After Fukushima disaster, We can live without nuclear power. In Germany, 25% of all electricity is generated by renewable energy. After Fukushima disaster, German Government stopped about half of nuclear power station. And succeed in a revolution of generation. Japan should reform it now, too."
5633,"I quite agree with you. Feeling sleepy or tired lead to a number of traffic accidents. In my family, who can drive car is only my father, so he always says 'I'm tired, and I wish this car was a autonomous driving car for only a short time.'when he is driving. So I'm glad to hear of this news and it is also good for the people who haven't driven car for a long time so called 'paper driver' like my mother."
5634,"I partly agree with your opinion.Indeed, nuclear power is terrible energy but if nuclear power generation is abolished, are there enough alternative energies. Unless alternative energies are invented, we cannot help but rely on nuclear power."
5635,"I think we have to have an interest in the art. I agree with your opinion.In a leisure time,I want to go to the museum."
5636,"I agree with your opinion. People who have much money should help poor people first. But, as we spend our money as we want , we can not decide how other people spend money."
5637,"I agree with your opinion. I have not been to go to Okinawa, so I have not know how Okinawa's dairy life. Reading your comment, I would like to think this problem again."
5638,"I agree with you. I think we don't need to think how to write kanji, too. Because we use e-mail and so on, the time when we write sentence with pen decrease. Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should be able to write and read many kanji."
5639,"I was surprised at the price of paintings. I cannot understand their purchasing will.The boom is transient. It does not last for a long time. I think it is no use investing paintings, but the boom may support economy."
5640,"I disagree with you, because I think that we don't have right to interfere in other people's hobby."
5641,"When I heard his re-election, I'm very good feelings.It is true that his deeds are not always good. However I think he is one of the best presidents."
5642,"What you say is the right thing, but there are no other place which is willing to accept the burden in Japan. I also think that forcing a disadvantage is not a good thing and sharing it is good thing, but no one want to have it. This is very difficult problem."
5643,"I think so too because gay culture do not spread in Japan. However,recently I often see such people in TV etc. So the example like article should be accepted in Japan."
5644,I think so too. I can't speculate what their plot to do next too. So we should think about them carefully. We must not look at this problem as bystanders.
5645,"I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems."
5646,I think so too. I don't know the painting's value. I think there are other ways to use a lot of money like donation.
5647,"I agree with you and have the same opponent. Such idea is good in reducing the sexual discrimination and attracting passenger's attention. Last month, I heard a piece of news about same-sex marriage is admitted in America. I want this movement to spread around the world."
5648,"I was amazing at this technology too. However, I was fear that driver is replaced by autonomous driver. Now, I go to school to get the driving license. I feel I can't rely on self driving cars."
5649,"Today, Japanese electrical companies are faced with many dangerous problems. First, South-Korea and China is increasing their share of electrical productions. And today, Japan can't go ahead. Second, Japan don't have a large amount of labor power.This is because Japan is decreasing birth rate and aging population, so to resolve many problems, Japan has to solve decreasing birth rate and aging population."
5651,"I agree to almost all of your opinion, but I can guess why billionaires spend a lot of money on these pictures. Perhaps, they want to add to their fortune, so they want to invest in something. However, because of the recession, if they invest in, they may not be able to make a profit. That's why they buy those picture for high price and they'll keep those till pictures' values become higher."
5652,"I do not know that kind of movements are taken place. In Japan, there are few people who care about that kind of problem. We have to know that kind of people are worry about their treatment. We have to acknowledge and recognize these problems."
5653,I agree with you. washoku is important to live long. This is why Japanese people live long. We have to save Washoku!
5654,"Like you said, I also think the government draw up some new laws about automatic driving. If these cars are developed and people come to need not to drive by oneself, who has the responsible? We? The company which produce one's car? The other people? There have been a lot of problems yet."
5655,"I felt the same feelings of you. I don't have a strong will, so I try to take in Nelson Mandela's will. And also I will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system."
5656,I was so happy about the fact that his anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. And I think it is great that someone tells you that you are the greatest son in the nation after the one is dead. I think we should pray for him too.
5657,I think that you are saying the right thing. We should obviously have washoku if you want to be in good shape. It is so good for health and it also makes you in good shape too! Why would you want to have fast food when you can get Washoku!
5660,I agree with your opinion very strong. People in Japan have to be dealt equally. So the government and some administration will not help your plan.
5662,I agree with you.
5663,I agree with your opinion. Indeed nuclear power plant is very efficient to produce energy. It does not emit co2 so the plant is very environmental friendly. But we have to think about the dangerous. So I think the nuclear power plant have to be decreased.
5665,"I agree with you. I think so ,too."
5667,I was very surprised with your opinion. I can not think that way and that aspect. New employment have to be given to the people.
5669,"I agree with your opinion very strong. Indeed the noise of the plain is very loud.And The plain flies around the city, there are many schools, companies,people, this situation is very dangerous. But American troops are very important for Japanese international situation."
5670,"It is very difficult to know the value. If I had much money, I would not buy such a thing."
5674,"I disagree with your idea because I believe the 'perfect' self-driving system cannot exist.However great the system is, every system has the possibility of making errors. In addition, the biggest problem is the absence of a person in charge of safety. Therefore, I believe human beings should drive our cars on our own and drivers must be responsible for the safety of other traffic."
5675,I agree with you. I cannot understand why some people buy this for such a expensive price.
5677,"I generally agree with your idea. however, my opinion includes a different point. In representative democracy, The Prime Minister isn't elected directly by the Japanese nation.The election of The Prime Minister don't always reflect the voice of the nation at that time exactly.Therefore,I believe it is necessary that people insist on our minds in politics strongly like Okinawans."
5679,I think this problem is difficult too. people in Okinawa want the American bases to leave Okinawa but people in other prefecture will not welcome them.
5680,I don't think so. I think driving by human is much more dangerous than by machine.
5681,I think we should think the way to produce enough power.However I think solar power is so weak that it cant make up with the nuclear power.
5682,"The problem of U.S. military base in Okinawa has been one of the most serious problem in Japan for a long time after World War 2. People in Okinawa have been suffered from noise that makes during training and some members of military committed a crime before. It may be true that U.S. military base is needed to continue friendly diplomacy with United states, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe need to not only pay attention to international relationship but also listen to Japanese people's voices."
5683,"I agree with this idea. Great art works should be kept in suitable conditions like equipped museums.Moreover, they should be inherited to the next generation. For the purpose, I strongly think that we try to avoid investing in great art works in order to keep them good conditions in the future."
5684,"I agree with your opinion. I am also worried if the self driving car can predict and prevent some risks. Indeed,it is very convenient that we don't have a driver's license, but I think quick decision and prediction of danger are human's peculiar techniques, so I'm scared that people completely rely on these artificial intelligence."
5685,I think so too. we Japanese are a little too indifferent this issue.
5686,"I cannot agree with your opinion. To be sure, Fukushima disaster was so terrible, but considering the fact that the population of Japan is very large but we have few resources, using nuclear power for electricity cannot be avoid. However, it is a different story that we have the nuclear weapons. To begin with, japan promised on the constitution to use nuclear power peacefully, in other word, japan must not use this power as weapon. For this reason, I cannot agree with your opinion entirely."
5687,"I'm for your opinion. I believe it is essential for us to spread renewable energy instead of nuclear energy. Also, the Japanese government must try to popularize renewable energy. the Japanese government has to set up infrastructure in order to use renewable energy in reasonable price for the next generation."
5689,"We usually don't think the right of gays, so it is revolutionary idea that they use traffic lights that all people see everyday for campaign. Actually, in these days, it seems that the campaign of the right of homosexuality is stimulating. For instance, same-sex marriage has just accepted in all states in America."
5691,"I agree with your opinion. 'straight' people sometimes have bias against 'gay' people. However, through like this campaign, it can make people pay attention to gay and deepen people's understanding to gay, and people won't criticize them unreasonably."
5693,"I agree with your opinion that changing constitution is very risky, but is it best way that we are saved by America? The cost of U.S. military base occupies much of the budget of Japan and people in Okinawa have suffered from noise. Like these. there are many problems related U.S. military, so I don't think saved by America is best way. We have to considerate and search the another way of saving our Japan."
5704,"This idea has 2 sides, pro and con. It can be seen as a discrimination since we separate lights from the normal ones. It also shows that we have understanding about particular sexual propensity. It may work well in Austria, but if it were installed into Japan, I don't think so, being that some of us still think that the LGBTs are not in our company."
5705,"I agree with your opinion. However, it is true that there are people of LGBT in the world since it is proved biologically that 10% of human are to be born as LGBT, so we will have to consider about this issue in some time."
5707,"the battle in Okinawa was the one of the most cruel battles in WWII. I watched lots of documentaries on TV about this battle and many innocent citizens are murdered. We shouldn't put the American military base in Okinawa since they are some traumas or to say we put them as victim instead of the mainland. Thus it is not abnormal that people in Okinawa protest against Mr,Abe."
5708,"We should show the world that we are not monkeys who only consult someone, but we also can't deny that we are being consulted by someone to be built many basements in Okinawa."
5713,"I think so. Autonomous car driving still has many problems. If autonomous driving cars were sold, society not absolutely prevents many problems of autonomous driving system like a drone."
5717,This's because of its historical value that the price is so expensive. We have to preserve arts from decay and it is not easy to do for ordinary people. Then museums try to save it or some rich do that. They also do it maybe for their contentment.
5718,"I think this news shocked many Japanese people.That is because until I listened to the news for the first time,I expected that there weren't the problems about the immigrant in Japan. The Japanese government should make the law system for immigrant to live as comfortable as Japanese.One of this problem is that few Japanese people know and are interested in this accident of immigrant.The most Japanese are shamed as Japanese for listening to this news, the better the environment which immigrant live is."
5719,"Like your opinion, I was surprised at this news and autonomous cars have excellent potential to reduce the consumption of the energy for driving cars and decrease the number of traffic accidents and get rid of the traffic jam.But I'm worried that the only computer without us drive. When autonomous cars run on an expressway, if the computer is out of order, there is a possibility to cause a miserable traffic accident. I think that we should drive cars by ourselves until we will be able to put absolute confidence in autonomous cars."
5720,"I agree your opinion. I also think that in case autonomous cars bring about traffic accidents,there aren't law to judge who have the responsibility in Japan.So I think we cannot see autonomous cars running on the roads in Japan unless we make enough preparation such as the law system and the confidence in autonomous cars."
5722,"I felt this article's idea is nice idea for something. For example ,for traffic jam and traffic accident. But of course it's not completely/ it's have to be careful for cyber terrorism."
5723,"I agree that this kind of idea is not familiar for Japanese people, but I think most people will not be opposed to this if this happens in Japan. It is because I remembered the news that people make their profile pictures rainbow on Facebook after gay marriage becomes completely legal in the United States. I see a lot of my Japanese friends did it."
5725,"I was surprised to hear that.',His big concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together when Mandela was finally released 27 years later.'This is very positive.And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission .He is fabulous."
5726,I'm in favor of your idea. I think the USA basses are important for Japanese defenses too. because Japan can not attack for constitution. so we need country which protect us. But of course Okinawa people's life is first of thinking.
5727,"I agree with you. this is a difficult problem. We should think a new solution to solve this problem. I am of the opinion that we should change bases place. However,here are no place where the American bases is replaced."
5728,"When I read this article I thought the USA bases have to be remove from Okinawa. But when I thought deeply , I felt the bases are important for Japanese defenses and Okinawa's economy. Because Japan can't attack to other country, so we need country which protect us. And the USA's soldier help for Okinawa economy."
5729,I agree with you. I saw current rate of Abe. That is less than 50%. I am of the opinion that he should change the stance to the Okinawa's people.
5730,I've got different point of view on this your opinion.I don't think gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. I have a friend who were gay. but he accept all people who are around him. we have to make opportunity which is gay such as him become famous. Even if it is change traffic right.
5731,I agree with you. Your idea of moving the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan is very good. This can solve a lot of problems we suffer.
5732,"I think this problem is very important for us. Japan have no army, so the link is necessary between Japan and U.S. But I cannot agree with Abe's idea. Japan lost WW2. And this cause Japan to walk to peace."
5734,"I want to get on this car. However, If this car can't control by our own hands, when this car's service is broken, we are likely to die of traffic accidents. So, we try to do more things."
5735,"I think so too. Renewable power is good for the earth, but it cost a lot of money to make many power bases. But we have responsibility that we have to save other animal, because we have broken the earth already. So it have to become truth immediately. I know it not easy."
5737,"I don't think so. This is because people have rights to do so. If I think the Gauguin's pictures valuable and buy this one , this things is economic freedom."
5738,"I think Mr. Abe try to compromise with Okinawa citizens. this is because when citizen are angry with their master, the master also can't do politics , well. So it is necessary for Mr.Abe to change his thoughts."
5739,"I agree with your opinion. If I was rich man, I didn't buy any expensive picture. because it just picture. But I know people who are rich have a right can buy expensive picture."
5740,I partly agree with you. We should remove the bases in order to keep Okinawa safe. I hear that the percentage of dependent rate which Okinawa economy occupy is about 10%. I think this is very small. We need not have American bases.
5742,"I agree with your idea. In the U.S , the same sex couples were allowed to marry with. This trend is important and we should spread this trend all over the world."
5743,"Thank you for your comment. I didn't think that the traffic lights will promoted by SNS. I rethink that it is useful to promote equality,but I also think that the traffic lights may be made a fool of on SNS."
5744,I think your opinion is nice one. but it is difficult to remove gun from society. Because gun has not only but point. For example gun help defense by my self.
5745,I see your point. But I am of the opinion that the master can do local politics. He should more think about the feeling of people of Okinawa and the merit of country.
5746,"When I finished reading the topic, I deeply sympathized with her. I cannot stand to see grisly depictions even in the fiction or dramas, so I was sure that I also might get big damage if I had been put in her situation. I think people in the court should have consider psychological burdens as very sensitive and important matters, and understand deeply that their casual action would change other's life to worth one than expected. I am surprised as reading this story. Especially, Aoki Hifumi suffered from"
5747,"I also don't know that the Prime Minister Abe was openly heckled by people lived in Okinawa.It is certain that many media such as NHK didn't report enough for us to understand the truth anger of people lived in Okinawa. To think of the problem about Okinawa, we should be able to have the information."
5748,"The consciousness reform about a woman must be needed in Japan. Although the Abe Administration and the Liberal Democratic Party are assisting female activity by means of only words, there is little actual action. This case clarified that sex discrimination was very strong, although democratization spread in Japan. Probably, not only the Japanese but overseas' people make disappointed. In the present social system women will be unable to engage to work. The Japanese male should get to know a woman's difficulty, and should change recognition."
5750,"When I read this article, I was surprised so much. Politics and money problem are often reported recently. In this situation, It is a very sad thing that a case like this time happened. According to this article, it is said that Miyazawa oneself does not go to the sadomasochistic bar. However, the problem is not whether Miyazawa went to the club but whether the money of politics was spent. By this case, Miyazawa resigned. Nevertheless, Ms.Obuchi resigned by the issue of political fund this time. The politics of Japan always betrays us. I want a politician to be aware that themselves support politics of Japan more."
5751,I think so too. Kanji is one of the most important culture.We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently.So we have to give Kanji's good point to other country.
5752,I think that Japan should take this plan because sexual problems are happening now . It allows us to recognize particular sexual propensity.
5753,I was surprised to hear this news. How childish they are. We must not discrimination because of men or women. We should respect each other.
5754,"Gay marriage should be accept in Japan. There is no problem about it, but maybe not easy to change some low. Because there is few people who against same-sex couple."
5755,"I don't want this self driving car . Because if we too rely on this car we can not concentrate while driving. This is too dangerous. So, we are more likely to happen traffic accident."
5756,This problem applies to me. I don't usually write kanji. I often use my cellphone. Kanji is our important tradition. We must pass our next generation Kanji.
5757,I think that Japanese people are liberal. We can shout out the prime minister to his face .This is very good .But i want the government to carry on what they said.
5758,Development of autonomous cars will make our life more comfortable. But I'm not going to take these car .
5759,Renewable energy will be more demanded in the future. This is because it is more safety for environment and nature.
5762,"I think this article is good and very useful, too. The article say present of renewable energy and future of. It have classification of power generation methods. Based on this article, the dispute about unclear power will become revitalize and easy to understand."
5763,"Your opinion is very interesting . But I don't think so. It is true that many driver will be not able to get a job, but they can get other jobs like a job to assemble a car ."
5765,"I completely oppose plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution. Although unfortunately, I have to accept the size of the US presence on Okinawa for to save the current pacifist constitution. We have found that the base won't be moved off the island now. It is is not realistic to materially reduce the US presence."
5766,I partly agree with you. Abe's policy looks radical. But it is also the fact that the current of this world is changing rapidly. The most important thing is we citizen learn what is happening now I think.
5767,"I think the activities of President Obama should be evaluated. Some people support same-sex marriage, some people oppose gay it. So, opposition to same-sex marriage is it that there is no way. However, if anyone does not act just because there is a dissenting opinion, the situation does not change anything. I think attitude to address actively the issue of same-sex marriage of President Obama is marvelous."
5768,"I regard him as his being a hero. He did the treason act of leaking U.S. information but I think that international society also needs those who can do action.It may be caught by the United States, so I want him to escape from the United States."
5770,"I agree with. I am not interested in arts, too. However there are more better how one parts with their money and they should change it. I think donate and thanks to special person for them is good how one parts with their money."
5771,"I partly agree with your opinion . Though it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous , the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So , I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered."
5772,"I totally agree with your opinion. In the current Japan, understanding of same-sex couples have been gradually spread, I feel. The same-sex couples will be able to get married, but there will be a variety of disorders, such as legislation and institutional reform. However, I think that same-sex couples will be able in the future to be sure to get married."
5773,"I think this event was wonderful. Japan has positively progressed the problem of LGBT, but It's still lag. We should get the understanding of LGBT and prepare new system for them after deep deliberation."
5774,I agree with your opinion. I also think that I should make use for next-generation activity by sharing a valuable thing among many people.
5775,"I thought the same thing. To make the system that nobody can take responsibility is irresponsible. I heard Tokyo University is inventing the road assisting cars to flow efficiently on main streets. In this case, government take the responsibility."
5776,"His achievement was fabulous. I cannot have thought that such an old person could conquer a mountain. If accidents occur, he never gave up. It is admirable. In addition, Miura and three other Japanese climbers must be good friends as the competition because they spur each other. I guess that their friendship is beautiful."
5777,"I did not know the autonomous cars began to become popular, and they must be safety drive more than people. I think it is helpful for people with a handicap to drive by themselves. If that is realized in the future, many people can try to drive safely. So, I think that it is an epoch-making idea."
5778,I think Abe's project ignores one's opinion who lives in Okinawa. That kind of war should never be happened.
5779,"I agree with your opinion. when he govern a country, it is necessary to persuade people carefully."
5780,"I think so. Certainly, this idea is very unique and good idea. Though the idea is effective Austria because Austria is tolerance for guy couple. It is not effective much in Japan which is not tolerance for guy couple."
5781,"I think achievements of Mr. Miura should be evaluated more. This is because it has been animated Japan that he reached the summit of Everest. In addition, his achievement has given a good image of Japan's elderly to people overseas. I want Mr.Miura to challenge various difficulties and invigorate people in Japan."
5782,"I somewhat disagree with your idea. It is sure this kind of art is difficult to understand, but it is bad to criticize them."
5783,"I don't know for sure if your idea is correct, but it is true only geothermal power doesn't meet electronic needs."
5784,"I think so too. Improving green energy is becoming important for Japan, because we knew the risk of the nuclear power by the Fukushima's accident and we were realized again the finitude of natural resources. We have to find other safer and more stable ways of electricity supply for the environment in the future."
5785,"I agree with your idea. More and more useful things are prevailed in our society , it is good of course, but sometimes it hurts many people."
5786,"I partly agree with your opinion. Though it is true that Abe's policy is selfish, the basic problem solves nothing only by other proposed sites being given if a base is moved from Okinawa . So , Abe should solve a diplomatic problem with the United States."
5787,"I agree with you in some parts. Self-driving car was a total fantasy that I never thought that it will come true. Just like our grandparents never thought smartphones will be part of our real world. science has provided us dreams and convenience that no other studies have provided to the human society. It became a fact that science has the power to improve our life. However, as famous quote states that 'absolute power, corrupt absolutely', which means that not only powerful figure will be corrupted and give bad influence to the world but powerful technology can be a trigger to a corrupted world. That is why we have to be very careful about new technology."
5788,"Marrying same sex people may be strange. I don't understand this feeling, but I can accept it willingly, because there are many people all over the world."
5789,I think this Abe's policy make a emotional dependence on nuclear energy. Japan has experienced many troubles related nuclear energy. This is the time to part from this dangerous thing like Germany.
5790,"If the American presence leave Okinawa, Japanese Self Defense Force will be stationed in Okinawa. Since Okinawa is located very strategic place. It is only changing from American presence to JSDF for people in Okinawa."
5791,"Now we use smartphone everyday, everywhere. When we explore some Japanese words, they are quickly changed to Kanji. It prevents us learn Kanji carefully."
5792,"I think so , too. I think it is an important thing in the coming world to recognize homosexuality all over the world."
5793,"When self-driving cars are populated, there will be a marked problem that it is going to face such as the safety. Safety problem will be the biggest and the never-ending problem for self-driving cars. self-driving cars will never be common unless it has overcome the problem of safety and gain the trust from majority."
5795,"Nowadays, one of the biggest if not the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing is global warming. Therefore, Japan, third biggest country in terms of economy, have to be a leader solving this problem."
5796,I agree with your opinion.Paying money to expensive art is waste of it.We should use money for other activities such as volunteer activities.
5797,"I agree to autonomous driving cars being sold in the market in future, too. Using self-driving system, we will decrease a lot of fatal accidents and prevent traffic jam. Although this system is still future system. It is necessary for us to add improvement to the system."
5799,"It is no doubt that the Fukushima nuclear disaster is one of the most disastrous incident which ever happened in Japan. I felt the feeling of both sadness and anger at the same time. I felt the anger towards the powerlessness of the government and myself. I is important to take actions, not become a bystander."
5802,"The nuclear problem is one of the biggest problem we, the human beings, are right now facing. The dilemma between high energy efficiency and safety risk which make us puzzle about what should we do. It is very difficult to select one in this case. More debate and discussion are needed in the future."
5804,"I got your point and agree with your opinion to use those money for other things such as donation. But, at the same time, I think somebody must keep valuable paintings for the next generation. According to the article,billionaires seem to be the best buyers. Thus, maybe they can cooperate with museums to make public people enjoyable."
5805,The biggest problem of nuclear energy is it's safety risks. Nuclear energy has not yet proven it's safety to people. This is why there are counter force which has grown and became a big group right now in Japan and all around the world. How to overcome the risks of safety is never-ending assignment for nuclear energy.
5806,"Japan, third biggest country in economic way, has a responsibility of solving the world's common problem. Nowadays, one of the most biggest problem in the world is environmental problem. Global warming has been spotlight for many years now in 21st century. Some countries came up with a idea of using nuclear energy which produces little amount of pollution with high energy efficiency. However, things always contains both positive and negative sides."
5807,"People discuss about running unclear power generation but there is more important thing. It is to use renewable energy effectively. Renewable energy is good for environment and has possible. So, Japan should focus on renewable energy."
5808,This news was shocking to me because Japan is believed to be a one of the best country with the technology of renewable energy.
5809,I understand how you feel! Enjoying daily conversation in transportation system is important in our lives when you think about losing the opportunity. I do want drivers who love their vehicle to stay there and give children hope and dreams.
5812,I strongly oppose Mr.Abe's policy. He does not think of Japanese people. The government should think Okinawa's people. They're very suffered from the American 's army. And we should appeal that American's army base is to violate our constitution.
5813,"I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I think Abe and Okinawa's people need more discussion. Because, now, both of them saying selfish claim."
5814,"As a country which experienced disastrous nuclear plant accident, Japan should use this experience to make a wise decision. I cannot say whether banning nuclear plant is good or bad for Japan right now but I can say that this decision should be made carefully. Moreover, Japan will change drastically when the decision is made."
5815,"I think so, too. Japan has constitution article 9. It is our constitution 's core. We should maintain this article."
5816,Reading this article in this timing is kind of interesting because same-sex marriage has been finally legalized in the United States recently. I do not understand why there are opposing people though after reading this article and comment of a former governor. I think the law will just give people more choices or options and so I do not think other people cannot take their rights away.
5817,"I always wonder why nuclear plants are so huge in the size. I am sure that when the size has increased, the safety risk will increase too. Therefore, sizing down the nuclear plants can increase the safety of it's self. If it is possible to down size the nuclear plants, at lease some of the anti-nuclear groups will admit to compromise."
5818,"Letting heritages showed to people has good effect and cause bad effect. 'People' contains many kinds of human. If who shows those great works can not protect them from some shameless persons like thieves, they should be kept in rich men's storeroom."
5819,I agree with you! I think there are many people who want to see an art and look forward to see it. So billionaires should not monopolize.Poverty should be saved!
5821,"To be honest, I am not a paint lover. So I don't go to museum very often. However, how much a simple paint can cost is just stunning. I know the name 'Picasso' but I don't find any attraction in his works. I doubt when people claim that his painting is awesome. I believe that the high price of famous painting is the result of a money game by billionaires who try to show off their wealth."
5822,"When I first saw this news, of course I was surprised by the crazy price of a one single piece of painting. I was also surprised by the power of brand. I am very sure that if this painting was sold without the name of 'Picasso' it won't worth more than $50. The power of brand made this unbelievable price which also give people a dream."
5826,"When I read this article, I think it is true that nuclear power generation is very dangerous, but the nuclear energy accounts for a lot of energy of Japan. So, I think that I cannot but depend on nuclear energy until renewable energy to turn into nuclear energy is discovered."
5828,"He is great man!! Probably, I cannot climb Everest. Despite I am 18 years old. But he is 80 years old!! I hope I will achieve something, when I am 80 years old."
5830,"It is very happy thing to be celebrated my country's cuisine. I have eaten Japanese dishes for about 20 years, and know the good and healthy taste of that. So I wish this will have more long history."
5831,I agree with your opinion. There are a lot of benefits. For example to help many people who can't drive because of physical. So this invention will may help mainly the people who can't drive because of physical. And we should think a preparation of new laws.
5834,"I think Mr.Abe manages not so bad in the problem of Okinawa,considering no politician could solve it with no Okinawans and Americans that is supposed to protect Japan discontent.And I also think these Okinawans should hake taken different way from jeering to represent their opinion."
5835,"I knew Nelson Mandela as a historical figure. So when I heard this news, I was surprised to know him as a man of today. I thought I should be curious about what is going in this world now."
5836,I agree with your opinion.Law expert's voice is absolutely correct.Public's opinion may be made by emotion not logic.
5837,"I was very surprised to read this news. The reason is that I had expressed great interest in the Nelson Mandela of thinking and behavior. That his death is very sorry for me, but I'm anxious that the people who inherit of his will and ideas appear."
5838,"I think so too. Before, I didn't know about the gay culture. But recently, I found there are many people who is gay on TV. So we may should import this traffic signals."
5839,"My grandfather is 81 years old now . But he cannot walk anymore. So I think that Mr.Miura is wonderful . And we can do at any age, until we have a dream."
5840,I think so too. It is very difficult problem. People who live in Okinawa want to remove the U.S. bases. So Japanese government should think about this problem carefully and try to get understanding from people in Okinawa.
5841,"I think this problem must be urgently resolved. That more immigrants die by such accident would adversely affect both Europe and Africa. And, I think this problem is that both Europe and Africa must be efforts to solve the problem. By doing so, countries in the region will also be on to cooperate. By doing so, countries in the region will also be on to cooperate."
5842,"I'm opposed to your opinion. I think there are more people who do not perform the murder for fear of the death penalty than people who carry out the murder in order to wish the death penalty. So, if the death penalty were abolished, more murders would happen than now."
5843,"There are a few thing which I think when I see this article. I don't know Chinese grammars, but we can explain words by using 'kana'. So, I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. However, Reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing now, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again."
5845,"I agree with you. Japan is far behind other developed country such as US in the understanding of the LGBT. Recently, states are considering legalizing same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, The Shibuya ward has become the first place in Japan to recognize same-sex partnerships. Although, we also acknowledge the developing."
5848,"Certainly what you said is the right thing, but I think Japan cannot produce a lot of energy without nuclear power. I believe the cause of the nuclear accident is lack of preparations for big earthquakes and tsunami. The nuclear power generation is still necessary for Japan. I think Japanese government should make the best to find a solution."
5849,"Your opinion very is interesting for me. Certainly Kyozo Isohi has to apologize to the families of the victims and be compensated for his sins. I think also that he should do so. However, I wonder families of the victims of this incident think that want Kyozo Isohi to make amends for sins and apologize to them. If my children are killed, I want to put the criminal that killed them to death. Criminal of such violent crime should be the death penalty, or, he or she should atone for sin over a lifetime, it is very difficult for me to determine which is more correct."
5850,I agree with your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong. Japan has to be independent.
5853,"I think so , too. Japan also tackle homosexuals problems."
5854,"I think so, too. Those who have great talent have to be saved by states, and we look up on them."
5855,"I think nuclear power is very attractive for Japan, too. We have to find alternative energy power."
5857,"I was also surprised and excited when I first met this amazing news. Theses days, not only automatically cars but also a lot of items which have been appeared only in SF world are invented. As you say, teleportation machines may be exist in a real world in future. Everyone may own robots like Doraemon someday. I want to see such a world till I died."
5858,"I think this problem is very difficult. Now, not all people accept this, same-sex couple marriage. So even if the government allows this, those who are around them may speak ill of them or avoid them as so on. So, many people should know more about them."
5859,I agree with you. Japan should not do war
5860,"I agree with you. The manual license has been replaced driver license limited to automatic transmission cars now. In the future, no license will become usual."
5861,"I think so ,too. And this problem is more difficult than we think. It is most important thing to know more about this problem. So what now Japanese society will become acceptance or not, we must be careful."
5862,"This is very difficult problem, I think. Actually, the opinions of all people do not become one, so we have to search the best way that all people become satisfied. It is not easy, but without it, Japan can not become better."
5863,"I'm very sad to hear this news. Prime Minister is the leader of this country and he should be doing what everyone wants to do.But The reality is so different, he got jeered in important anniversary day in Okinawa. I don't think we should be changing the Pacific Stance and constitution. He should be doing what we all can be happy."
5865,"I think that the nuclear energy has merits and demerits. The quantity of its producing energy is large, but if it goes wrong , it will become a menace to Japan. In these days, potatoes can be the energy like electricity, so it is good way to search for another technique of generating energy."
5866,"By using this meeting , we need to discuss the problem about US military camp."
5867,"By using this technology, we can make this world more useful.But, it has also demerits,I think. Too relying on this technology tend to cause car accidents.So we should use it in right place."
5868,I think that nuclear energy is essential for Japan. Because we don't have the source of energy . We doesn't live without nuclear energy.
5870,"The argument of whether the death penalty should be continued or not has been spotlighted for long time. Some people who are against death penalty claiming that it is too cruel to kill anybody. However, in my opinion, keep living in the jail until you die is much more cruel comparing to just end your life. There will be no motivation to live if you are decided to live until you die in the jail. Spending your life in the jail forever is much more cruel than just kill yourself in my opinion."
5871,I THINK SO TOO. WE ARE SAID TO BE SAFE FOR A LONG TIME. BUT IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ENERGY WAS DANGER. IT WAS REALLY SHOCKING TO ME.
5873,I agree with your opinion.Showing own identity is important.
5874,I agree with you in terms of the trouble of not only storage but also sending data files.
5878,I understand your opinion. We must get out of a paradox situation where people are dependent on nuclear power while nobody wants it in your neighborhood. But I wonder if it is possible because we do not know who and how it will be done. Japanese people have to think about this issue more.
5879,I agree with your thinking.We should consider that there are many people who is labored in cheap salary when we buy cheap clothes which made in Southeast Asia.
5880,"I think so too. In Japan, homosexual is not accepted. We should make comfortable society for homosexual."
5884,I THINK THIS PROBLEMS TO DIFFICULT TO SOLVE. WE COULDN'T SOLVE THIS COMPLETELY SOON. SO WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH TIME.
5885,WE SHOULD T THINK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND OTHER COUPLES . BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT THINK THIS DEEPLY.
5886,"Surely, your opinion is right. However, in order to protect our nation, it doesn't needed leave the bases on Okinawa. The claim by Okinawans is about bases in Okinawa, not in Japan. It's natural that Mr.Abe is jeered about this problem."
5887,"I think Japanese government is responsible for this accident. We should make some laws to protect refugees.Globalization goes on promoting.many refugees will come to Japan,whose society is safety."
5888,"I think so, too. I think people in Okinawa are forced to take an important role for the friendship with America. When I went there, I had not heard the sound of Osprey, so I was surprised at your episode. I hope that Abe will try to decrease the sufferings of Okinawa's people, too."
5892,"I think so too.If autonomous cars will be realized, although,in fact, autonomous cars are more safe than cars which human drive, I would feel autonomous cars more dangerous and cars which human drive comfortable. However, absolutely autonomous cars is profitable for human."
5893,I agree with your idea. Japan should solve this problem not only because nuclear power is dangerous and connote high risk but because Japan as developed country should be reader for environmental problem because of Fukushima accident. I think that government should show the world environment-friendly japan.
5894,"I agree with your opinion.I think that little Japanese people have the understandings for same-sax couple because they don't have the chance. Therefore, like Vienna,Japanese government should do the similar trial and gradually gain the consensus."
5895,"I partly agree with your idea. Historically there are what the country conquered and what was conquered and what was conquered has burden like Okinawa bases. However, Japanese government sacrifice only Okinawa instead of mainland. we should tackle this problem together seriously."
5896,"I agree with your idea. There is reason that billionaires should provide the paintings. They can buy and sell freely. However, these paintings is valuable thing for human. i think that billionaires should care about this thing."
5897,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at the picture of signal. I have not seen the signals like this picture in japan. These days, the problem of homosexual is increasing. I think it is important for us to think about this problem."
5898,"I agree your opinion. As you know, It is obvious that Japanese don't know the same-sex couples . I think we should learn the problem of homosexual more and look at the positive side of the problem. Of course, I also want to know the problem taking this as an opportunity."
5899,"I don't think so. The self-driving car is safer than existing car, I think. As you say, the self-driving car is not perfect. But, Google tries to make it nearly perfect. So, I believe this cars."
5900,"Japanese government should work on the problem of U.S. military bases in order to reduce them gradually, for I think that U.S. military bases remind people of fear in wartime. Also loud sounds and large land for bases confuse people in Okinawa. It is difficult thing, but government should get on well about this problem for good relationship between Japan and U.S.A."
5901,I also think it is important to consider not only the convenience of autonomous cars but also the safety of them.
5902,I think so too. This movement will be make Japan an equal society if Japan accepts this system.
5903,I was also surprised and I agree with you. There was another way to use the money.
5904,I agree with you. I think Japan should depend on natural powers more.
5905,I was also scared to see the accident on TV and I agree with you. Japan should not generate electricity by nuclear power.
5906,I was surprised and sad when I read this article. I can't believe the prime minister who is the top of this country was heckled in public.
5907,I agree with you. I think also that American military bases are reminders of fear in wartime.
5908,Your idea is very interesting. This technology will reduce the number of traffic accident. But I think the drivers don't have to get driving licenses because they won't drive by themselves.
5909,I think also the development of autonomous cars will be our lives more comfortable. But why aren't you going to take these cars?
5910,I was surprised when I read this article for the first time. But the movement is extremely nice because the rights of both normal couples and gay couples are equal.
5911,I agree with you. I think also Japan should accept same-sex marriage system.
5912,"I think so, too. I'm never familiar with art, so I can't understand the value of the works."
5913,I disagree with you because the nuclear power is too risky.
5914,"I think also that the nuclear power has merits and demerits, however I think the power has more demerits than merits. Japan should not have the nuclear power."
5915,"I think so, too. This problem should be discussed more carefully."
5916,"Your opinion has a main problem in real. As you say, Japanese government has not found new places to move US military facilities. I also think the good relationship with America is very very important. We have to help each other in the future, but this problem is big."
5917,"I also think people around the world pas attention to this topic!! When I heard the news of the legalization of the same-sex marriage in all state of America, I remembered this topic. Many Japanese people don't think this topic deeply. I also was. I'm glad to have a chance to think about this."
5918,It seems that Prime Minister Abe will be heckled in terms of his way of government. He tries to do what his grand father could not. It has passed many years since his grandfather's age.
5919,"I didn't surprised at his news, but I was very sad. Prime Minister Abe is too active for this Okinawa problem. His achievements and speech reminds me of the right wing. I hope that he don't be more aggressive."
5920,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe is blind to our own opinion and hope. But, American's army are important for Japan, so we cannot be too aggressive or too submissive."
5921,"In those days, the bill that the same-sex marriage is allowed in all the continent was passed in America. I think that this is very important thing for the world view of gay or lesbian. But, I also worry that people's view for them is more severe."
5922,"I wondered what made this accident's culprit write such a foolish doodling. He might have been very angry and reasonless in that time, and I understand that art is not valuable for some people, but it was not allowed to deface this product. So I think that the culprit cannot be allowed, and I hope the Tate museum will be more carefully."
5926,I agree with you. It is interesting if it comes true that perfect self-driving system is in use everywhere.
5927,"I think so, too. We should overcome this weak points. In these days , potatoes can be the resource of the energy like electricity."
5928,"I think so, too. We Japanese had better learn from failures we made in the past. I don't want to be included dangerous wars."
5929,I think so too. Too many elderly people can be problem. It affects young people. I suppose that the increasing of young people is related to economy growing.
5930,I think so too. We have to live with nuclear energy. We should learn the useful and safety way of using nuclear power.
5931,"I agree with you. I am not interested in art, so I do not understand why people want to buy Picasso paintings by paying so much money, but I think it activate the economy."
5932,I think so. Prime minister should hear what people are saying. I think that it is bad ideas to be included to the war.
5934,I tend to agree with your statement . I was very sad when I heard this issue.
5935,I agree with your opinion. I think Japanese young people have to supporting the economy.
5936,It is my first time for hearing nation changes its national flag. I am very surprised. I think it is natural to eliminate the other nation's symbol or image from own national flag when the country independent. I understand New Zealand people want to change the flag.
5937,I also think changing national flag is big problem. New Zealanders should think about their flag deeply and decide. It might take long time but this is great important for New Zealanders and the image of them from other countries.
5938,"I tend to disagree with your opinion. Because nuclear power is so dangerous. So people living where near the atomic power planet ,they were under threatened."
5939,"I agree with your opinion. In Okinawa, there are a lot of people who are suffered from US troops. But it is obviously, Okinawa is very important place strategically. So we have to think about this problem more seriously. As long as we can, we have to think this in terms of people of Okinawa."
5940,I tend to agree with your opinion. Because this issue is very difficult problem. There are big conflict between the pride of independent and the international relationship. And I don't want to change the flag of Japan.
5941,I agree with the way of installing new traffic signs. This problem has not been aware of recently. It is time that we should be more tolerant of homosexuality. We can't laugh at people who are not straight.
5942,"It seems that there are particular about the paintings. Since I'm not good at paintings(I actually terrible at paintings), I don't know why people want Picasso's painting even though they pay a lot. But It's because I don't have any knowledge of how Picasso is great."
5943,"I am one of the person who is suffer from nuclear radiation. In fact, people don't worry about it so much. Children play around outside. They have time limits though just in case. I want people who are from Futaba, Soma, and so on, go back their home, but Japan has to increase our economic development first."
5944,I agree with you about installing new traffic sign. I think discrimination consciousness to same sex should be lost.
5945,I have read the article which the crime rate of Okinawa had raised since US bases appeared. Not all crime are caused by American.But I think they should be in the island to protect Japan. I am interested in the interest to the moral of a U.S. army.
5947,I agree with your opinion. It is important for Japan to allow the army to stay in Okinawa.
5949,Kanji is the most important culture. Recently we use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us.We should use Kanji more and more.
5950,I tend to agree with your comments. The Japanese energy problem are serious. We should find the big energy which turns early in a nuclear power.
5951,I think same sex marriage should be legal. And I should admit this issue. Same sex to give up get marry because it was illegal. But I think this idea is so bud. Couple is couple. I should be allied with love person.I think that it is include in a right of the freedom to recognize this.
5952,"I agree with you. These days, I hear the news about same sax marriage on TV or newspaper so often. I hope all the people live together even if they are same sex couple or not."
5953,"I agree with you. The Fukushima disaster made us good opportunity to think carefully about the energy and our safety. As you mentioned above, there is limit of natural resources, so we had better to use green energy."
5956,"I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields."
5958,"I agree with you. As you mentioned above, if the self-driving cars become popular, almost all of the traffic accidents would disappear. I also think it is important to make safe self-driving cars."
5962,I think unclear power is terrible. But people who lived there really is difficult life . Unclear power has a bad influence. Japan should not use it.
5963,"I was imagining the car which is autonomous too. Today, from now on we will be in new trouble ."
5968,"I can see what you are saying. We tend to be interested in new technologies and we tend to think we have to use them. But It's not true. As you say, we can use public transportation to reduce traffic accident instead of using cars."
5981,"I think so, too. I hope to take the American bases away from Okinawa as early as possible."
5982,I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe should more think and try to negotiate to Us
5983,I agree with your opinion. We should think these people. I want us to have more widely view of the problem.
5984,I agree with your opinion. I surprise to read the article.
5985,I understand your opinion.I think so too your opinion and nuclear power is decreased slowly.
5986,I agree with your opinion. The technology should be developed carefully
5987,I think so too. I can't understand what wealth people think.
5988,I think so serious the situation. Our social member decrease so our burden is more.The problem is so hard. We should solve the problem.
6013,"I think the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. People's lives are equal,so we can not decide it. China's Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. I think its reason was lack of persuasiveness. However,if we fall into such an situation,we should choose anyone. The best way is saving all of them,so we have to think this way every time."
6015,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised. This question is too ridiculous because we must have a complete grasp of the surrounding situation when we face such a situation. In my opinion, I choice the person who can't escape on his own. So I think it shouldn't appear in the exam because it is difficult to give the correct answer or solution to the problem. What is more, I can't understand why the person who doesn't help mother amounts to a criminal failure to act. As someone says in the article, people's lives are equal, and they should be treated equally by the law. I also can't understand why no-one on the Chinese Internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. I feel women's status in China maybe weak. This is a pity, so I want China to change such a world little by little."
6016,I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. Our choice should depend on not blood relationship but the situation in which we are placed. So I think it is unusual that country is concerned with self-decision in that situation.
6024,"The question means 'rank the values of people's lives'. I think the way of thinking itself is fundamentally wrong. The question was made on the assumption that people's lives are not equal. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. If I were a one of the examinee, I might choose my mother too because of a feeling of gratitude for her raising me. However, I don't think it is a correct answer. To begin with, the question doesn't make sense. So in my opinion, it is not appropriate for the official judicial examination."
6026,"I was very surprised to read that the question, 'Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire', appeared in the National Judicial Exam. And I was also astonished to read that a son is legally to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think the question is ridiculous. There are two reasons. First, all people must be treated equally, so we should not think which person we should help on priorities first. Second, if we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be easily upset, and we will not be able to tell which is better. Therefore, it is no use to think about this question."
6029,"I considered about whom I will choose in such situation, but I couldn't make up my mind. I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. I can't understand why the choice of girlfriend will be a crime and the choice of mother is correct. It is not ethical. The people who make the National Judicial Exam should think about this question again."
6030,"I agree with you. The question does not have the answer. Although the Ministry of Justice said that saving parents over other people was the right answer, other people also have the life, so there is no reason to give up them. This question shouldn't have been on the exam."
6031,"I was so surprised and couldn't believe when I read this article for the first time. I think the question like 'whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire' in a compulsory test is ridiculous, because people's lives should be treated equally. However, there is a sentence like 'I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own'. I think there is some truth in what one man said. When looking for the effective breakthrough, it might be the best way to help both mother and girlfriend. But I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it."
6032,"I think the ideal for this situation is leaving one's own thought, not decided by the law. However, we cannot act freely without the regulation by the law. In this case, we cannot criticized by the law if we save mother while dismiss a girlfriend. Of course, The people who related to a girlfriend in this situation will criticize to us. It's hard for us to choose which is justice, observing the law honesty or handling with our opinion and situation. By the way, in the first place, I doubt the thought that question is suitable for the national exam. Certainly, It's justice because this sentence is exist as the law. I think this theory is good, but they should've think it thoroughly in the process of making the questions. Also, to begin with, this question express the posture of China that they only think about man, I think they are still childish by the view of a one of the Japanese people."
6033,"Before mentioning the subject, I'm concern about that multiple choice test can decide who is proper to be a legal professor. Also, the subject whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime isn't the problem which is decided with such choices. I think that the question can be changed by time and each person has each own answer. Nobody don't have authority to settle the so difficult question, I feel because according to some famous persons such as Jefferson, Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr., all people are equal. I now maybe save my father because my parents are the most precious persons for me. If the question are answered by not only trainee lawyers in China, but also people all over the world, regardless of sex, it become more important opportunity that everyone deeply think about human's value and sexual problems, which people cannot have solved."
6034,"When I first read this article, I was very confused and I couldn't make up my mind for the National Judicial Exam's Question. This question is that whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not. In this case, he saved his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, so his action amounted to a criminal failure. To be sure, we only have one mother and father, so parents are precious for us. So if I come across these helpless situation, I probably help my parents. However, girlfriend or boyfriend is also precious figure for us. In addition, people's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. From these reasons, I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. We should take good care of our parents and also treat friendship as an important matter. If we would fall with these helpless situation, we ought to make a good choice appropriately for the each occasion with the sense of ourselves. This is a debatable problem because we can think it from various point of views such as law and sexism. I also thought there are some difficult problem which we can't answer clearly and briefly."
6035,"I can not agree with this Nobel Peace Prize. I didn't know this news well,so I checked other article. As the article says, actual lives are terrible in Tunisia. Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. In other words, reality is far from democracy's success. I think it is strange that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens, so I disagree this Nobel Peace Prize."
6036,"Who would decide what life is more important than another? Nobody can rank people's lives,as we all know.I was so surprised to see the question asking such a thing that I could hardly believe it was from the National Judicial Exam. It is definitely ridiculous situation where a question like that has a certain answer officially,I think (as a Japanese) . But I must say China has traditional Confucian values,which has a doctrine ranking seniority above the youth. I think this cultural background is worth considering ,when we discuss the problem. You cannot deny the fact that cultural (or historical) context differs from country to country,and that makes their own law systems effectively work. So ,after all, what is needed now is Chinese's interest in the problem and their deliberation over it. Only Chinese could fundamentally settle the question that China faces."
6037,"I was surprised at this news. This question has serious problem. Ethical issues should be treated with caution. That they rescue girlfriend or mother shouldn't make to correct. Such as this question, I think we should not compare the human life. Creatures of life is something important equally."
6038,"It is very difficult question that 'Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire'. It ask that 'what value do you put on?' In the world, generally, it is said Europeans and North Americans put value on his girlfriend, but Asian put it on his mother. It comes from difference of culture. European and North Americans think 'my mother enjoyed her life enough and now it is my turn so I have to get happiness with my girlfriend'. The other hand, Asian accepted influence of Confucianism tightly and it teaches 'Be good for older' so Asian may think 'why I leave my mother?'. However, thought difference of difference, it is same heart that we don't want to meet these situation I think."
6039,"I was surprised at this news.The bar examination is a national examination.You must not make questions for the problem that you cannot judge the right or wrong in a national examination. Since China has a large population, it is unavoidable to make questions for a tough questions.However, it is unfair to make questions for a vague question.Since it is the examination that the results are decided on with one, there must not be such a situation.I think that they should increase the number of people who make questions for the bar examination ,thereby they can make questions carefully."
6040,"I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen.If the situation happened and they didn't think about that,they couldn't cope with that correctly.So,I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. For sure,the test is good for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession.But,I don't want to imagine that situation like choosing to save my mother or my girlfriend.I imagine that situation,but I can't make an answer.The best thing is that it won't happen.I only pray that it won't happen."
6041,"I was surprised at this news because I didn't think that such situation is defined by the law. this question is ridiculous. This should not be defined by a law. It's an ethical problem. A person will became desperate only for saving a life in such situation. At first we should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. If I face the situation, it is very difficult choice. I think that I will help my mother. However, actually, I don't know what I would do unless I really face the scene. Reading this news, I came to think that I should be filial to my parents."
6042,"I disagree that the Ministry of Justice said the correct answer is a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. To begin with, I don't agree that the lives of parents are more valuable than the lives of girlfriend only because of blood relative. I strongly believe that we should treat the lives equally. In addition, it is strange that this question has a correct answer. Also, it is stranger that the question is presented as a national examination. Finally, we should not depend on one idea. If the national exam ask me an answer, I would answer that there are plural answers about this question depending on various factors such as closeness, love and situation. All in all, I strongly believe that we should make decision according to the situation."
6043,"This is a difficult problem. Whether law should contain ethics or not is controversial. Certainly, ethics are important, but law should not necessarily be influenced by them. Law should be a pure rule. If law completely contained ethical points, it would not be a rule. I think law paradigm should not contain ethical elements completely. However, law is made by people, it would be influenced by ethics to some degree. In this incident, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems. First of all, there is an ethical problem that I used to refer to. Second, this exam is sexily unfair. Third, China is usually irresponsible and cannot be relied on, so the exam would be groundless. Therefore, to look at this news from a lot of points of view, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems."
6044,"Certainly, I think the Nobel Peace Prize is becoming the thing only for the name when I finished reading this article. Only the efforts in moving the North African country towards democracy cannot solve the all problems. But, it is difficult to solve all of them. Then how much contribution will deserve receiving a prize? We have to decide the range of it, and raise the standard up. If we can do it, the Nobel Peace Prize will become the thing which Alfred Nobel wished."
6045,"I think that the people who make this question do not have the heart which man has. I do not know his feeling, and I do not want to know it,too. I study subjects of Judicial Exam because I guess that I want to be the prosecutor. I have the purpose of being the prosecutor. Two years ago, my grandfather is dead. The people who break the law of traffic run over my grandfather . I can't forgive him. I guess that I want to judge bad mans. Because of this incident, my thought for Judicial Exam is very strong. And, I think that people who have this thought are not a few people. If each people had different thoughts, people who study subjects of Judicial Exam would have very strong thoughts. However, this question makes fun of people who have it. Everyone can't compared their mother with their girlfriend. I think that my mother and my girlfriend are very very important people for me. I want to rescue both of them. this problem is not a judicial problem and is the different problem. I hope that the people who make this question want to make judicial exam with the heart which man have."
6046,"The question whether they save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is discrimination for girls. This means China is not interested in care about discrimination of sex. I think that this must be corrected. For example, if I were in the same circumstance, I could not choose ."
6047,"When I read this article, I was very confused. The story that a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother is a criminal is so difficult for me to consider. If i were in such situation, I cannot chose one of them. As the article says, I also think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally b law. And, there is a problem in the question. The problem is that the test clearly assumes the test-takers are male. I think the test should be reformed for both men and women."
6048,"I think so, too. The problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. When I fall into such a situation, I cannot choose one of them. I also think the best way is to save all of them. I want to consider the topic more deeply."
6049,"I think that the Nobel Peace Prize are becoming a mere name. At first, some current winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are not suitable. For example, some winners assisted the war, some winners received the prize before realizing the peace. In addition, some winners seems unstable by other reason. For instance, like Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, did not accomplish the peace movement. This winning seems the committee of Nobel Prize regards process as important than result. I doubt this way of thinking because the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with accomplished peace. All in all, I strongly believe that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace. Also, I hope that the Nobel Peace Prize bring us the peace."
6050,"When I read this article, I really interested in the relationship between the society and sexism. The question focuses on the emergency situation for male, not female. First, I think it is natural because most examination candidates in this exam are male, probably. However, if I was an examination candidate, I would confused when I encounter this question. I am not familiar with law so I don't know the right answer for the question but no one cannot find it, I think. The right choice changes depending on the background of the family, couple, and the condition of their health. By the way, thinking about this problem is so interesting. I felt that compare the one answer to the another answer is meaningful. Last class I heard some opinions about this question, every one has different thinking. I didn't achieve the right one answer, want to continue to thinking."
6051,"I was surprised the contents of the National Judicial Exam in China. This question which whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is difficult for students. I wonder this question has right answer? The thinking which each peoples have are different. If I were a student who takes this test, I will answer this way. 'I will save my father. Because, my father is only one and he are older than my boyfriend. My boyfriend has more physical strength than my father. So I think there is a possibility of my boyfriend living. 'This is my thought. According to this article, some people think 'Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum.' And some people think 'People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law.' I think so too. I can't decide one answer. But, I think this question is very interesting. I want everyone to answer it. Some days ago, my friend told me a funny story. She has a boyfriend. She asked him 'which will you save me or your mother from a deadly fire?' And he answered ' My mother.' She was shocked this answer. I thought it is poor thing when I heard this story. People's lives are very important. This question was too difficult for me to answer."
6052,"I was very shocked to read the news. So far, I've believed without doubt that all people who be awarded the Nobel peace prize should be respected. However, after reading this article, my thought changed. If the fact which it says is true, I think needless to say the prize makes no sense. A part of successive Nobel peace prize winners' actions are inconsistent with contributions to world peace which originally should be praised by awarding the prize. I can't understand why such people win the prize who were concerned in a war, dispute or military action. How are recipients of the Nobel peace prize selected? I think the selection criterion is not appropriate. It is better to make that stricter. I don't want such people, for example, Obama, Kissinger and Hitler, to be winners of the award from now on."
6054,"I was surprised to find that Hitler and Stalin had been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Until reading this news, I thought that the Nobel Peace Prize was always awarded to people who were respected by all the people and had been peaceful active to the end of their lives. However, my idea about it was wrong. I think that Barack Obama is not proper for Nobel Peace Prize, because he only gave peaceful speech, but he don't do active for peace. On the contrary, he is ultimately responsible for the recent US bombing in Afghanistan. His praise is just so much talk. I want the selective Noble committee to award the prize to those who are really active for keeping peace."
6055,"I think the raw system in China is sometimes unreasonable. For example, only a child policy is very exorbitant. Whether we have a child or not and how many children we would have must be depend on us. However, Chinese government decided and direct its people. In this article, the question is really unreasonable. They asked us whether we help our mother or our girlfriend. Who can make up our minds? It is the kind of question that we cannot answer. Therefore it is ridiculous to ask such a question. I think there are a lot of other question which must be asked. Nobody can answer this question because both mother and girlfriend are important and every human lives have to be treated equally."
6056,"At first, I was surprised how active and brave the Tunisian quartet were! In Tunisia, a lot of acts of terrorism have occurred and there are some radical Islamism people, so I had thought that Tunisians had difficulty in wishing for peace. However, I knew that the Nobel Peace Prize, which praised the person who was the closest to peace in the world, was base, so I thought who could decide what was peaceful in the earth? Also, I had felt that Obama had worked hard for peace, but it is not completely, I think. How can we have peace in our hand?"
6057,"I think that Novel peace prize is not fair and correct in every time. As this article, people who could win the prize moved for peace, but some of them did things which can destroy the peace. Further more, we have to remember that Novel prize is made and operated by human. In short words, they includes individual thoughts. Actually, people who chosen by Novel prize committee is famous for their action, but also they were chosen by individual vision. I think that the prize for Obama represents these problems of Novel prize."
6061,"I think the Nobel committee should think more about the situation when they give Nobel peace prize to someone or groups. In this case, the incident that Tunisia became a 'pluralistic democracy' was great in the whole history, but the reality in the country is far from success. They should not have given Nobel peace prize to Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet considering entire affairs in the country. Furthermore, in the case of Hitler and Stalin, they did cruel thing toward the civilian, so there was no reason that they should be nominated because of their activity. The Nobel committee have to think about not only the activity but also surroundings when they nominate or give some groups or someone prize."
6062,I agree with you. Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded when genuine peace can be seen not only by Nobel committee but also by those who live in the country. I also hope that true peace will come by the existence of Nobel Peace Prize.
6063,"Influenced by this article, after today's class, I searched Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, and then, I found an event- Jasmine Revolution. The revolution was named after the representative flower of the country. At that time, Tunisia's unemployment problem was so serious, and many young Tunisians were not satisfied with the state. These situations caused the revolution of Tunisians. Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, which worked for peace, was a very brave group, I felt. Also, the group influenced other countries. In particular, in Arab countries, some people raised revolutions against their countries' governments. The Tunisian Quartet achieved great activity for world peace, I conceived."
6065,"I have already known that people who was awarded Novel peace prize breaks world's peace. Therefore I was not surprised at this.I saw other people's comment and I noticed many people was surprised at this and says that Novel peace prize should be abolished. It is true the fact the people who breaks peace are awarded should not be allowed. But Where are people who don't do bad thing? There are no such people in the world. Therefore,the system Novel peace prize is awarded to people is bad. Novel peace prize should be awarded to the action of committing to world's peace."
6066,"I saw this news and thought China reminds Confucian view. 'Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire' Chinese think that they should save their mother because children must service for their parents in terms of Confucianism.But logically thinking,girlfriend and mother are equal. Chinese thinking is old,therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date."
6067,"When I first read this article, I was surprised and I thought that this is a worldwide difficult problem because the Novel peace prize is a global valuable award, so it is difficult to withdraw prior award or change the conclusion. So, in this case, I think the Novel committee should think seriously about not only their active's results but also the social situation in Tunisia. The quartet made a peaceful dialogue and helped to find consensus-based solutions to a wide range of challenges which get over political and religious divides, so certainly, their working is superb, but it is said that their action is not worthy of Novel peace prize. In additional, Hitler and Stalin were nominated before, but I think they were unworthy of the Novel peace prize. To begin with, we should reconsider what is the Novel peace prize and its standards for judging. Also, we should have a correct appreciation its actual value."
6069,"The Novel prize was started from 1901. It has six parts. Chemistry, literature, peace, physics, physiology, and medicine. It follows the Alfred Bernhard Nobel's last will and testament. He is from Sweden and is well known as a scientist who invented dynamite. Thanks to dynamite, he accumulate an extraordinary fortune. However, as you may know, dynamite is used as a weapon, so he became very sad and started to seek the peace. Therefore he decided to write will which asks building the Novel Prize by using his almost all inheritance. After his death, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist found that prize. It is beginning of The Novel Prize. As I wrote, originally this prize is started to keep peace, then those who receive it must be pacifists. Also, I think that the award ceremony have to be done peacefully."
6070,I completely agree with you. People who receive the Novel Prize must think deeply about these problem because this prize is regarded as the most famous and important and honorable prize.
6072,"I agree that the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet were award the 96th Nobel Peace Prize.2011, the Arab Spring occurred, and a despotic sate broken. The Islam party and the worldly party stood in opposition. Then, the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet mediate between these party and established a new constitution. And it democratize their country. I think it's great. But, I cannot agree that Barack Obama was award the Nobel Peace Prize. Because, he just adopted that total abolition of nuclear weapons. And he did not carry out. I wonder why he was award the Nobel Peace Prize? I think there are person who are more suitable for the Nobel Peace Prize than Barack Obama. I think the reason why the Nobel committee gave it for him is he is famous and has influence. The committee did not think the contents. But I think it is the Nobel committee's fault. The committee should think over that who give it for before decide."
6073,"Before I read this article, honestly, I am not interested in Nobel Peace Prize so much. Every year, I saw the result and know the prize names and thought that they are great. That's my relation to Novel Prize, so I didn't research about them. However, I noticed that my habit was seriously wrong. This prize is so important for politics, history, and our studies. To know why they were awarded, how they were making efforts for peace are very interesting. In this article, it is said that not all Nobel winners are recognised a good prize example now, but the time when they were nominated Nobel prize, the situation and the social voice were different. We cannot say anything without to know about the sequence of events. Now, I interested in the relationship between the Nobel peace prize and the world affairs."
6074,"To tell the truth, I didn't know this article. And, I didn't have a lot of information about Nobel Peace Prize. Read the article, I think I cannot agree this winning a Nobel award of the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet. As Heffermehl says, I also think the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet do not fit the model of 'a great visionary idea of peace'. I hope the Nobel Peace Prize become noble, no matter who looks."
6075,"I agree with what you say. To be sure, The Nobel committee have to consider who or which groups are worth being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
6076,"The attack to The Medecins Sans Frontieres is unbelievable since some innocent people who made lots of efforts to save many lives are now lost. They had realised that they are working for a danger place, so they had informed of their location to the U.S. army. Even though, the army bombed wrong place. They have to be sorry now, and regret for their whole life, this is that heavy. Human making mistakes is comprehensive, but they had already done the same things many times. About the awkward peace prize winner, I think they are deserve it since almost no one who exhale the word 'peace', does nothing at all to keep or create peace even just around him. Compared to these coward, the winners deserve it."
6077,"Simply, if it were me, I choose my girlfriend. If saying the justice, they should save both, that is a hero, but mostly people can't afford it. As Chinese law says, mother and father are who raised us from our birth to this world. There are no doubt some parents who would long us to help them first, but taking future into consideration, we should first save our lover first. This problem doesn't only exist in China, but also all over the world. What should be most asked is not their choice of saving which life, but it is their courage. In a quite dangerous situation, whether they can think of someone's life first is significant."
6078,"Your point of view is very exact. People say it is objective, but as all the words and ideas are thought and reified through our brain, it is perhaps never objective. However, to solve this problem, there must be much people to elect the winner. If we collect many opinions, we can make it closer to objectivity. In that case, There comes another problem that if one of them have more power than others, it can be like autocratic."
6081,"I was surprised at the question. I think that the worth of all life is equal. So, that helping his girlfriend is crime is unequal. Besides, the expression of girlfriend or mother means that the hosts of The National Judicial Exam suppose that the examinees are male. I think this is female discrimination."
6082,"I thought that this question whether they save their mother or girl friend from death is terrible and sad, because it means to judge which value of the life is better. It is unbelievable question, I think. We should have recognition that all the life are equal all over the world."
6083,"I think the same opinion with this article, especially, the win of Barack Obama is unjustified. At first, the existence of peace prize is hard to choose because it is absolutely thing. As for Obama's example, he is not achieved anything, his evaluate reason is his posture trying to keep peace. As a result, he hasn't achieved to clear the nuclear power from all over the world yet. And then, like a Stalin, the person who contribute to peaceful activity while doing evil about to award some times. Of course, it's not hard to check all about one, but the committee should do the best to investigate. At any rate, Nobel Peace Prize lose substance, the committee may be troubled to choice person or groups, I thought. However, there is a fact that 'Not applicable' is not accepted by many people. They expect new hero every year. So the rule I thought is 'don't give prize to people who haven't do something concretely yet.' If so, the criticize will reduce and we can keep dignity of Nobel Prize. Is the peace only expressed by this form, Nobel Peace Prize? I think the peace is not think by comparison with force. The peace is condition which we don't need to think 'peace' again."
6084,"It's difficult problem whether you should choose your mother or girlfriend. On the one hand your mother is the only one. You were born by your mother. And you were brought up with your mother when you were a child and young. Whenever you feel sad, lonely or sore, your mother supported you certainly. On the other hand of course your girlfriend is important for you. Your girlfriend is your partner. If you marry your girlfriend, you will spend a lot of time with your girlfriend. So generally you can't choose whether your mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an answer."
6086,"I think that the selection of Nobel Peace prize is difficult. It is a hairsbreadth distinction between peace and war. We cannot say the person who ended war is the symbol of peace. He may be opposed to military power by it and might bring peace. Even if he did not use military power, there is that some race became persecuted because of the person who prayed for peace. I think that it was right that Obama refused the Nobel Peace Prize. How many people would die cause of Obama's orders? We should not only respect the winners of Nobel Peace prize and also pay attention to the occurrence in the background of the receiving it and the later incident. And we must think about the meaning of the receiving it. I think Nobel Peace prize can realize an existing original purpose by it."
6087,"I think Chinese people usually help their father or mother because of Confucianism,and I expect that students who took law tests are tried whether they had esteem to their parents or not.Added to this ,in those days Chinese people have the general idea that are the same as European people ,so some of those people who are tested may choose to help their girlfriend ,I think. And ,a strange point of this test is what do people who made this law tests need to answer . At the same time,I thought this problem is not relevant to laws.I could not understand the intention of this problem"
6088,"I agree with your idea. The problem ,which person should help , contains ethics.I studied the difference between laws and ethics in jurispurudence.Infact, ethics are contained with how to think that has diversity. So ethics changes according to people ,that is,every one has their original opinions. On the other hand,laws are the rules that are minimum.The laws are the minimum rules,so that people who break laws can be punished. For the ideas stated above,this tests contained ethics and laws ,and laws and ethics should not be mixed."
6089,"By reading this article, I suggest one idea that Novel Peace Prize Committee need not to give Nobel Peace Prize every year.Even if the committee give it to groups which far from pacifism and the wish of Nobel Peace Prize founder,the groups can move boldly and their ideas are in danger of being treated as pacifism by using the tittle of NovelPeacePrize.So I think this prize should be awarded when something relevant to unchanging peaceful things (for example ,saving degrees or giving best to lose discrimination.)happens ."
6090,"I think that the Nobel Peace Prize is unreliable. This prize can be politically used, and have been so for many times. Certainly the wishes of the Alfred Nobel is wonderful, but this prize is getting corrupted. The example that the attack which Barack Obama, a Noble winner in 2009, was responsible led to the deaths of 22 people at the hospital run by MSF which was the winner in 1999 is so ironic. By the way, the international organization is usually unreliable. UNESCO registered 'Documents of Nanjing Massacre' as the documentary heritage. I think that UNESCO will not be politically used and secure fairness and transparency. Like this, UNESCO cannot be relied on. The United Nations which has UNESCO, etc. is also unreliable. To consider carefully, the United Nations originally consisted of the countries which was hostile to Japan in 1945. After all, they will not protect benefits of Japan. Therefore, the international organization is unreliable."
6091,"I agree with your idea.Groups and thinking that are at first looked peaceful may be changed by the international situation,so I think it is difficult to judge what is peace .By considering this facts ,we should discuss what is peace .I think peace can also indicate the situation that there is no war."
6094,"I was surprised and shocked when I read this article for the first time. Before reading this article, I thought that the Nobel Peace Prize winners should always be respected, but by reading this, I changed my thought. I think that they are not always respected because some of the winners of Nobel Peace Prize advanced not the peace but the war. For example, Alfred Nobel who is the founder of the peace prize owned a company, which made a 40mm cannon, and the aircraft was almost certainly using it. In other words, Alfred Nobel killed a large amount of innocent people. That true is unbelievable. I want Nobel committee to have a discussion carefully about a candidate is really should be awarded the prize or not. I pray that by awarding the prize to those who contributed the world peace, there will no war in the world."
6096,"I agree with you. Your investigation is great. I think Tunisia should diminish the gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens. Additionally, we should reconsider the awarding system of Nobel Prize."
6097,"I agree with your opinion. Needless to say, human lives are equal. So, I strongly believe that the correct answer by National Judicial Exam of China is not correct. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically."
6098,"I don't agree with your idea, but the way of your thinking is quite interesting to me. There are a lot of ways of thinking whom to be saved. Thus, the National Judicial Exam of China should not seek only one answer. Additionally, this exam should attach greater importance to the process of thinking rather than to seek only one answer."
6099,"I think that it's difficult for us to judge whether the Novel Peace Prize winners are suitable or not.For people who support them, they respect the winners that they do actions for their peace. However, others are criticize the winners for they do actions that are not suitable for the peace. I would like the member of staff to see not only the result but also the background and effect."
6100,"I think that your idea is quite unique. I checked the awarding record of Nobel Peace Prize to find that this prize has been awarded every year after 1973. According to this record, at the beginning, the prize reflected the wishes of Nobel, however, these years the prize is against the wishes of Nobel, and I doubt the purpose of awarding the prize has been used politically. I hope the prize should be awarded to the suitable person."
6101,"I was surprised at this news. I think it is natural that people who won the Nobel Peace Prize are praised.It is a fact that war did not die out after having been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.However, they rendered remarkable services to the cause of world peace.Their actions are worthy of praise.It is impossible to completely get rid of war.There are various races, religion, culture in the world.Owing to different thought, war happens.The war will not happen if all of us respect thought each other.However, the war is not avoided because each person has strong faith.The war is miserable and cruel.Since it is impossible to completely get rid of war, we should work hard to reduce war.We should praise them who contributed to peace movements.I am proud of them."
6102,"I agree with you. Whether the winners are suitable or not, depends on the world affair and the generation. So it is difficult to say the old former winners were wrong prizes. After 20 years from now, the result of 2015 might be said that it was wrong. I think that winners were certainly did a great job when they nominated, so every winner doesn't have to return their prize."
6104,"It's difficult problem whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I can't answer easily. First of all, I think this question is discrimination. If girls answer this question, it will have to boyfriend instead of girlfriend. So, this question shouldn't be on the exam. But, I think it is interesting! I want to consider it. If I answer it, I will give I save mother as an answer. This is because my mother raised me, often listens to my problems, takes care of me when I have a cold ,teaches thing to survive like the way of making dinner, laundry, using money. I need to repay an obligation for my mother. so, I help my mother."
6105,"I think there is no right answer for the question. Thus, I do not understand why National Judicial Exam can decide whether people who chose their girlfriend is wrong. I would argue against if I were the one who answered girlfriend. It is because I think it means my thoughts are denied by an authority without justice. On the other hand, this article says it is interesting that nobody points out the sexual nature of the question as it assumes only male test-takers. However, I do not think it is such a big issue. Men are usually considered stronger than women. It is not that stressful or difficult for women to think about this situation on the assumption that I were a man."
6106,"I think we do not have to take away any Nobel Peace Prize from anyone. I would take President Obama as an example. Independent on Sunday columnist Cole Moreton criticizes Obama with the recent US bombing in Afghanistan as it causes 22 people to die. However, I think Obama made his decision to destroy the world peace. Although their death is sad, he always tries his best to maintain peace. I believe it is wrong to take the Prize away with one mistake. I hope people can respect Nobel Peace Prize more and actually before that, we must be more interested in. To be honest, I did not know a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia won this award this year."
6107,"I wonder is Nobel peace prize really has something meaning for humans? Nobel peace prize is very easily influenced by the age, politics, sense of value...etc so it is used easily by politics insistence. For example, Aung San Suu Kyi who is Burmese treated political prisoner in Myanmar. When she got the Nobel peace prize, Myanmar government opposite hardly. Another example, Barack Obama who prized approaching working for non-nuclear world but he decide to reinforce corps to Afghanistan and it is criticized that the flames of war was expanded. What do I want to say, the Nobel peace prize is only honor and not or more. There is no actual profit, and people don't move without actual profit so I think there is no meaning for Nobel peace prize for humans. It is only used politics influenced."
6108,"I think your opinion is really sharp with a great reason, but I do not want to believe international organizations are unreliable. I think there might be some ways to fix those corruption. We should find solutions instead of complaining about it because there are people who need international organizations to help. How can we make organizations or governments to be for people? If you have any good ideas, I would like to hear."
6109,"I was so surprised to hear this news in many points. First, it is inappropriate to make questions for a legal examination. this is a too ethical question, so I think more legal questions should have been on the exam. Second, it is a bad question in terms of its ethical and sexual lukewarmness. Our lives should be treated equally and questions of this test should not be made for man. When I read this news, I do not think it is rude so much. If I was a girl, however, I thought there is a feeling of wrongness in the question."
6110,"Firstly, I think that I can not understand the people who came up with the question. Think normally, this question does not have an answer. At the same time,people who aim to lawyers must choose. To sum up, they are forced to ultimate choice to choose either like this question. I aim at the lawyer, too. If I become a lawyer, not only lawyer but also people who became the legal profession, not uncommonly they are pressed for ultimate choice. Therefore, as I stated it first that I can not understand this question! But now, I think whether this question expresses the essence of the occupation called the judicial officer."
6111,"I am surprised to hear hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China have been asked C in a compulsory test. I am of the opinion that this question does not have absolute solution. I guess that both girlfriend and mother are special for us ,and we do not have alternatives. This is why this question does not have the right solution. However, we have to understand Chinese culture. In China its philosophy or thought is called thought of Ju-ka(thought of Confucius).In the thought of Confucius, they have to cherish our parents, because they have a debt of gratitude to grow up. Based on this thought, China makes up history. This is why we do not need to decide whether we would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. However, we have to understand their culture of to think a great deal of their father and mother."
6112,"I think the word 'awkward' is proper for this situation that people who appealed or relate to military force win a Nobel Peace Prize. But I also think this have a reason to be. To make a peace is to stop or finish any kinds of fights.Fight doesn't stop without someone who to finish it. If the one never appeared,the tragedy continues forever. Whether it is by military power or power of words,the finish of fight or truce should be admired to some extent. Ironically,Nobel Peace Prize just have fame to do so and very useful.So the prize will be used for various political reasons from now on too.This is one example of this 'awkward' situation. The theme brought up in this article is based on many difficult reasons we cannot explain easily."
6113,"I think that this question is unsuitable for two reason. First, the answer doesn't have correct answer. Test-takers spend in different home environment, so the way of thinking is different too. Second, law should be a logic that convince all people. Law forces all citizens to obey, so it mustn't contain morals. I think it is good that the question sparked on the Internet. Now is the time to discuss this problem."
6114,"I can not believe that such a question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think no one could say which is correct. If I am asked this question, I will not be able to answer. Our lives are equal, so we should not compare the worth of lives. And however there were female, this question assumed that examinees are male. I think this question is not appropriate for the National Judicial Exam."
6115,"I think so, too. Indeed, many people may think that Obama destroys the world peace. However, Obama must have believed that the world become the wonderful world someday, and Obama always did actions for the world peace. I know that man often remembers people's bad action, but man forgets people's good action."
6116,"I think the Nobel peace prize winners should be people who are worth to be respected by many people in the world. However, some of the Novel peace prize winners are unaccepted their award. I think we have to know their efforts and activities before people criticize them, because many people who suffered from any cause might be helped by their activities. If people still have critical opinions after they consider that facts, they should raise their voice in public."
6117,"I agree with your opinion partly. This situation may come true someday and we must select which life we should save, so it is a good idea to think about it. However, I think the question is too inappropriate to be on this important exam in terms of its sexism and unmorality."
6118,"Oh my god! In the second line, I wrote 'this', but I should write 'This' because it is the first ward of that sentence. Sorry."
6120,"I think when Nobel Peace Prize winners are selected, the members of it's selection committee need to ponder to find the most appropriate person for it. For example, they should invest not only a candidate's achievement and popularity but also faults or risks for the achievement. Certainly, to carry out it, it takes more times and it may cause the risk of making the selection difficult, I hope the most appropriate person is selected."
6121,"It is obviously difficult to decide who is worth the Nobel Peace Prize,I think.One's action for realizing peace may not necessarily be the one that can work in the way intended for someone,because nobody can completely anticipate what would happen by his action beforehand.So now I think how we should decide the winner can only be discussed,not be clearly answered."
6122,"The problem is difficult and I think the problem is nonsense,because this situation cannot be occured.Confucianism in China may answer that should be helped mother.But both girlfriend and mother are special for us and this situation are not thought various family environmental,for example be abused... Some of those people may choose to help their girlfriend but I think this answer is not mistake. I think this question should not set a student for the National Judicial Exam."
6123,"I think that it's difficult for us to judge whether the Novel Peace Prize winners are valuable or not.However I agree this news title 'awkward' about Nobel peace prize.In fact,war, dispute and civil war occur in the world.People think the Novel Peace Prize is promoting peace.But,Barack Obama received this prize in spite of occurred US bombing in Afghanistan. I have some doubts about the Novel Peace Prize significant.I seem to be inconsistency."
6124,"When I read this article for the first time,I doubted the truthfulness of the article,and it was so surprising for me. I think 'joke candidates are bad for democracy because I can't feel their sincerity from their attitudes. Candidates can be national leaders whose role is to reflect public opinion in policy decisions. Certainly, what you wear is freedom and a form of self-expression. However it is natural for members of society to wear clothes appropriate to the occasion. In addition, they should watch their words and actions, especially the person who wants to be representative. As the above account suggests, I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives. However, in the class, a student said ' Democracy is free not only for us but also for candidates ,so it doesn't matter'. This didn't exist in my opinion , so it was interesting for me to come into contact with a different thought. I feel the importance of studying all together in the class again."
6125,"I heard this news on TV at first. At that time, this story was reported as a joking matter. I did not take it seriously, but I became to think that we have to give this problem more carefully consideration after I read this article. We should not confuse democracy with joke candidates, such as Ukraine's Internet Party represented by the Sith Lord. It is certainly that democracy is fair and equal treatment of everyone in organization, and respects their right to take part in making decisions. However, we must not have the wrong idea of liberty. We should be discreet in liberty that is given in democracy, I think. At least, a candidate who is identified Star wars character should not be elected to the city council. Therefore, I think that 'joke' candidates are not good for democracy. And then we have to make wholesome democracy."
6126,"This is difficult problem whether we should choose our mother or girlfriend. On the one hand, our mother is the only one. We were born by our mother. And, we were brought up with our mother when we were a child. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our mother supported us certainly. Mother is an essential person for her child. On the other hand, of course our girlfriend is important for us. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our girlfriend supports us certainly, too. If we marry our girlfriend, we will spend more time with our girlfriend than our mother. So girlfriend is an essential for her partner. From the reason above, we can't choose whether our mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an unapparent answer."
6128,"I agree with your idea. A few days ago, China decided to abolish the system of a one-child policy. These days, the economic situation in China is declining, so I think China ought to reconsider their own nation systems. In addition, I also think it is impossible to answer this ridiculous question whether you help your mother or your girlfriend . We human lives should be treated equal."
6129,"I think your idea is very right. Hitler and Stalin's achievement were not worth getting the prize because they discounted human rights and the importance of life. If they got the prize, it means their achievement was right. I don't think so. Of course, Novel committee ought to think the standards of this prize and its value, but also we should be more interested in and reconsider."
6130,"I feel a very strong anger on this issue. First of all, I think problems that correct answer is entrusted largely to the values of the individual should not be appeared in the National Judicial Exam. Then, I think it's also problem for China that the law which it is necessary to judge which her and mother is better is not yet abolished. The legislator in China should do away with the outdated laws. I can not make out why they don't do it yet. I hope law students who had worked on this problem will solve this issue very much."
6131,I saw this news on TV at first. At that time I can't understand what happened because I only saw Chewbacca arrested by police and I thought people was arrested for only disguising costume of Chewbacca because Ukraine police is spoilt. But I knew the truth is different from my conjecture when I read this news. Truly A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning. Candidates should reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy. But 'Chewbacca' 's action is contrary to democracy. He insults many Ukrainians who hopes true democracy. I want him punished severely and I hope such people never appear.
6132,"I agree with your idea. If I were in such a situation, I could not choose whether I would save my mother or boyfriend. And I also think that the best way is to help both of them. Of course people's lives should be treated equally. So this question that demands that they decide to help only one is inappropriate, I think."
6133,"I think so, too. After reading this news, I looked into what criteria the selective Noble committee uses in deciding whether a person should be selected. Then I learned that a criterion is unclear about a connection with actual services to the cause of peace. If the selective Noble committee had considered actual services to the cause of world peace, why Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi did not selected the Noble Peace Prize? I am inclined to doubt that notional interests and a social standing of a prize winner have an effect the criterion. The selective Noble committee should choose a prize winner more clearly."
6134,"I agree with your opinion. Initially I only paid attention to the costume of the joke candidate because Chewbacca had a lot of visual impact for me. However you focused on his actions from beginning to end from the viewpoint of democracy which he should not break legislation, and it was so great. I also thought I want such people not to appear. I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives."
6135,"I agree with your opinion that a candidate who is identified Star Wars character should not be elected to the city council. When I read your opinion, I deepened my understanding about democracy because I couldn't reach the discussion which made reference to liberty. It is difficult to debate liberty, but I think this candidate has the wrong idea of liberty clearly. Therefore I respected you for being able to reach such a thought!!!"
6136,"I think the accident in Ukraine have a big problem over our thought. First, they take part in political activities as the character of 'Star Wars'. They should enjoy with these at the party, shouldn't do in public space which decide the posture of government and nations. Second, the name recognition of these character is much bigger than any other participants, it cause a big effect to politics. It's a level that some people can let any person win the election. Actually, 'Palpatine' have won the election. And also, in the accident of Chewbacca, It's funny that he reject a duty he must pay fine. To begin with, this accident prove that they are not suit to work in the political world. The Ukraine government should make an effort to protect their fairness and exclude this group. I hope these group don't appeared in our country."
6137,"At first, I can't understand this news clearly. I've never seen 'Star Wars', so those names mentioned in the article were strange to me, except for Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another bigger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are dressed in character costumes and it is allowed. I think, in Japan, there is a tacit understanding that such a joke is not suitable for political situations. I've took it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which the article says. However, I don't think their style is wrong. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Recently, democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to 'joke' candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a 'joke' candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. 'Chewbacca' is a good example. In conclusion, freedom should be allowed in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances."
6138,"I was surprised at this news. I wonder why Chewbacca who is Star Wars character was arrested. It is not prohibit that Chewbacca is engaged in political activity. However, he has a problem in the attitude toward political activity.'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet' When I read this sentence, I could hardly believe.Though he was fined $8 for breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, he made a lame excuse.Moreover, he did not take off his costume though he was in the court. Such a person should not do a political campaign.A faithful person should go into politics.Even if he is elected, he will not be able to perform the proper political activity.We got the opportunity to think about politics through this artcle.We should have more interest in them."
6139,"When I read this article first, I couldn't understand in detail, because I don't know Star Wars character very much. But I know Chewbacca is a hairy creature in that picture, so I wonder why Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine. I think 'joke' candidates such as a man dressed as Chewbacca are not good for democracy. Certainly, I think candidates can wear some clothes which they like, it's free for everyone. But they should wear proper clothes for occasion. In addition, the candidates have responsibility to campaign for the election, so 'joke' candidates should work seriously. I want all 'joke' candidates will be punished and I hope all candidates will campaign for the election seriously and such a 'joke' man will never appeared."
6140,"At first, it was difficult for me to understand the whole story of this article because I have never watched the Star Wars and these names are unfamiliar to me. After I read this article, I felt that they should be sincere in voting the election. We should not act costume play like Halloween party at election. But, I have another idea that people would be interested in election because of their strange costume play. However, I disagree with such a costume play at election. Additionally, it may be free for all people to dress any style (I suppose it is not illegal to wear any costume), but people who dress such a costume should not cause trouble and commit law. I hope everyone should obey law and be sincere in voting the election."
6141,"I laughed when I read the news and arrested man said 'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' I can't understanding why he completely became Chewbacca and said these excuse. Also I was surprised at Darth Vader announced his candidacy for the mayor in Odessa. Democracy is in close connection with liberal and so, they have the right to put himself forward as a candidate for mayor as a Darth Vader(if the law permit) but I think if they have common practice, they didn't think up these foolish action. In the Democracy, we elect the leader by the elections and candidate's talent is very important for the mass people so if the candidate is fool, it is very dangerous situation for administration. I think we have to educate more politics thing especially in Japan."
6142,"As I have never seen 'Star Wars', this news was a little difficult for me. In this article, the story seems to be joking such as Chewbacca was arrested...,Darth Vader,etc.,but this situation is actually serious. Ukraine is a chaotic situation today. Last year, Russia took over the Crimean region which has belonged to Ukraine and the eastern parts of Ukraine have seen fighting between locals and Russian-supporting rebels. America and European Union did not cope with this situation properly. Russia is clearly dangerous, but no countries cannot impose heavy sanctions on Russia. In my opinion, the situation that Russia is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council is ridiculous. If Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council, unless Russia lose their status, the situation will not change. Certainly, talking each other is important, but America and EU should give heavier sanctions on Russia."
6143,"When I looked at this photo for the first time , I was very surprised at the photo . And, I can not help thinking about what was happening in Russia. After reading this news, I could not understand all information of this news, because I do not know characters of Star Wars at all. So I thought about this news from the point of election. It is true that by using the well known character, the candidate who uses it may be enough famous and he may be elected. It is a merit. But, it is also true that people who choose the candidate may not see his pledge. They may vote him as if they vote Star Wars character. If people vote him only seeing Star Wars character, it has no meanings of election. From the point of election,it should be done fairly,I think using character is not good."
6144,"I don't know 'STAR WARS'. So, I cannot imagine the incident of this news, but there is what I want to tell you. I think that you must not hurt others for your hobby, and must not hurt public welfare for the hobby. Indeed, you may want to be immersed in a hobby. I have the same feeling. The time immersed in hobby is happiest, and a person is enriched. But even if there is such reason, you aren't supposed to hurt public welfare. When your hobby hurt public welfare, the conduct changes to a crime. you should not consider this fact easily. I think that it is after there is happiness of a person around, that a person can enjoy a hobby."
6145,"My father has liked 'Star Wars' since before I was born, so after I read this article, I told this news to him. Then he laughed, and I felt that the movie was really loved by people around the world. The excuse of this criminal was very humor but too contrive, so I think that his own excuse led himself to arrest. Also, remaking national statue into a Star Wars' character and identifying with the movie character was probably people's longing for the new world, I think. Without traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals, this world might have already changed."
6146,"I saw this news at first,I don't understand and I think this is a Star wars Parade. But,this is important .this case shouldn't be joke.I think these' joke' candidate shouldn't be elected,because I don't feel these Star wars candidate think for democracy seriously. Of course,candidate is guaranteed of a set right for example wearing and speech.But we shouldn't have a mistaken idea of freedom.They are mistaken,and break a rule,so they are arrested. They have a possibility of disturbing a fair election. I don't want to come into existence these misunderstanding group in Japan. And Japan should teach importance of fairness of democracy and election."
6147,"I never think of that idea.For sure,our parents is the ones who have raised us,and we should appreciate them.That is hard true.But,our girlfriends is also important person who may be a partner in the future.So,when we think of future,the choice we save our girlfriends may be better/"
6148,"I have thought that the Novel Piece Prize is given to the one who contribute to the world piece.For example,Martin Luther King Jr.,Mother Teresa,and many grate persons are awarded. However,according to this news,there are some people who don't deserve it.When I read that,I think that is true.Barack Obama occurred the bombing in Afghanistan,but he reserved the Novel Piece Prize.This is awful.And also,in the past,Hitler and Stalin was nominated.I can't believe that. In my opinion,the system the awarded persons will be canceled when they act unsuitable action should be introduced to get back it's prestige."
6149,"I agree with Nobel Peace Prize. According to this sentence, the problem that some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize do or did not contribute to peace essentially exists certainly. However, it is also true that the Nobel Peace Prize has been a symbol of peace. Do you know Malala Yousafzai, 17, is the youngest winner of a Nobel Prize in any category? In 2012, she was shot in the head by members of the Taliban in retaliation for her work to guarantee the right of girls to education. In 2014, she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to protect children's rights. Then, she said, 'This award is not just for me. It is for those forgotten children who want education.' Now, she has struggled for girls to have the right to education. And her courage has attracted global attention. Thus, some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize contribute to peace honorably. When you discuss the rights and wrongs of the Nobel Peace Prize, you must consider the behavior of more Nobel Peace Prize winners."
6150,"At first, I did not know what is Chewbacca, so I could not understand the topic and the picture of the article when I saw them. After I understood Chewbacca, I was confused even more. I think the tendency which people love the animation and movies such as Darth Vader is good. But according to this news, it advances in the bad direction. His excuse, 'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' , is definitely no joking matter. We must not excuse by using the characters. Its act would become the insult about them. It is not true love. If we want to love them, we respect the character and should behave definitely."
6151,"I was very surprised when I first read this article because I cannot imagine someone doing the same thing in Japan. I have never watched Star Wars before, but I know the name 'Darth Vader', and the fact that this character is a very famous villain, so I could not stop laughing at the man. However, as I read this article a couple of times, I thought that this incident might not be something to make fun off. This incident was taken place in the Election Day. The Election Day is a date to decide which person to entrust the country. Therefore, nobody should cause such an incident that might seem foolish. It is not clear how this incident would affect the result of the election, but it is very extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. To sum up, I was very surprised that there are people around the world who does things that I can't even think of, but it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is."
6152,"I thought that the author of this article had a very extreme idea when I read it for the first time. However, as I read several times, I began to think it gradually that there's reason in what he or she said in it. If a Nobel Peace Prize winner does an act against peace, he or she will be deprived of his or her Nobel Peace Prize. And, he or she will not do the awkward facts'."
6154,"I didn't know about Chewbacca,and was very confused when I read the headline.Such joke candidates as Darth Vader cannot be democratic representative ,I think.Nobody with common sense would agree that they can satisfy popular demand,or manage complicated political problems.Now we should think about what the democracy has to be,and how we can realise it.And we must say,at least, candidates from Star Wars is not the answer."
6156,"I read this article, then I feel so bad. Because I do not like china. I guessed that it is china issue again. However, I feel that the most bad thing is equal rights for men and women. Naturally, low students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is very bad issue. But, in the first place, why they chose girl friend? Why is it not boyfriend? It is assumption that it is object of man, not woman. At this time it is not equal rights of men and women. About the other, which people did you chose girlfriend or mother? They said, it is that all people are equal. But I think we are always partial in the world. It is properly. I help an acquaintance whether we help acquaintance whichever with a person not to know at all. Will there be the person who is not so? I think that no people who think help not know people. People always discriminate. So, they persecute or despise other people. It is not only Chinese issue, but Japanese issue. Of course I discriminate against such me. This is because it thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family. (206 wards)"
6157,"The existence of official candidates uniquely dressed could be permissible because they are a kind of performer especially when they appear in front of us. To stand out by any means and attract people's interests is necessary to some extent. But in a word,this case is bad. To use STAR WARS character is apparently improper for such place. Reading with Japanese sense of moral,this article is very surprising and strange. But I also think such candidates may be one of the symbols the confused situation Ukrainian is facing now."
6158,"I was very surprised when I read this article. The reason is because Chewbacca was arrested. According to this article, he was arrested because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. However, I think that his arrest is attracted worldwide attention and it has become a very effective political activity. I appreciate the importance of propaganda in politics deeply. 'Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter. ' So, I have to pay attention to what Chewbacca do the next in order to save the life of the Ukrainian people."
6159,"Thank you very much for your comment to my opinion. And I feel honored to be said that you respect me for being able to reach such a thought. However, I think that I have to understand about democracy and liberty more deeply. It is really difficult to debate on political issue like democracy or liberty, even if we talk in Japanese, I think. So, we should study not only English, but also social problems."
6160,"Every point criticizing the current capitalism referred in the article deeply impressed me.In reality,in Japan,the poor are now getting poorer,and the rich are now getting richer,say,we all know Japan is in a serious 'depression',which generally makes income gap wider.Though we can see slight inflation nowadays,the situation is still far from good.And,what is more,when it comes to discussing Japanese future generation,we can hardly be optimistic, considering the fact that Japan has a great national debt.Putting the environmental problem aside,we have to think about Japanese economy first.We cannot manage any environmental problem without money."
6161,"After I read your comment, I agree with your comment. As I also have never seen 'Star Wars' and I knew nothing but Darth Vader, at first, I wondered who was Chewbacca. In addition, it was hard for me to understand the situation that party candidates were dressed in character costumes and Star wars characters were elected to the city council. I do not think that such a situation is allowed in Japan, either. If anything, Japanese people will not pay any attention to a joke candidate like the Internet Party. I also think that freedom should be allowed in democracy, and we have to discriminate between liberty and freedom. And parties such as Internet Party should take action, using moderation."
6162,"After I read this article, there are two points that I thought. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market. In such a strained situation, almost all innovators or energy buyers can't afford to switch a new energy source just for the climate problem. Secondly, I thought about Japan. I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. So the poor can be the rich, depending on how much effort you make. However, I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, because the population of Japan is expected to be smaller and we have the problem with immigration. Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. We should be faced with such an issue."
6163,"I agree the statement from survey that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. I think today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds. Mostly, people with an advanced academic backgrounds get good jobs, so people study hard. However, there are the places where you can receive good education if you pay much money, for example, private colleges, cram schools and so on. Therefore the rich can put their wealth to get good education, and the poor can't. Of course, if you don't have much money to use for education, you have another way to get good jobs. This is only one of many examples. However there is a fact that children who were born in poor family have to work for their family and give up to continue to study. The government must deal with this matter we should not let pass."
6164,"I was surprised at this news. I have not heard such a news in Japan, so when I first knew it, I could not understand what had happened. In my opinion, everyone who wants to participate in politics should obey the legislation, so his action is unforgivable. No one want to follow him even if he is elected. Perhaps some people become interested in him because of his costume, but it will not make true democracy. I think the man should have considered about his action more and more."
6165,"I agree with you. I had thought that his action was bad for the country because of violation of legislation, but it is true that this incident attracted worldwide attention. I also want to watch carefully what Chewbacca will do next for the Ukrainian people."
6166,"When I first read the headline, I was surprised and couldn't understand the meaning because 'Chewbacca' isn't a human but a character of 'Star wars.' At first, I read this story and thought it is a funny story because movie character was arrested and when he had to pay a small fine equivalent for $8 for the disturbance, he said he couldn't pay 'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' However, after I read this article many times, I think this is a serious problem. I think he would like to appeal to public for something, so he dressed as Chewbacca and took action like this. This incident also reflect the social problem in the world. As for his action, I think it is not good because people wouldn't like to vote these character. It sounds like joke. The election should be fair and serious. After the election, someone who elected ought to have a responsibility and lead people. So I think 'joke' candidate is not good for democracy. I would like to focus on his future action."
6167,"I think your idea is right. His action sounds like joke even if he had rationale opinion. From these story, we can reconsider the social problem, so I would like to focus on this future story."
6168,"After I reread this article in today's class, I thought about whether 'joke' candidates are good or bad for election. I had first thought that such a candidate was not serious about election. However, one of such candidates Vitali Klitschko, who identified as one of Star Wars characters, was elected mayor by majority. Now election all over the world has difficulty in attracting civil attention, in particular, young people's ones. That's why I think that the pleasant campaigning of election is effective in people who are not interested in election coming to it. Election should become more appealing for all people, I think."
6169,"I agree with your opinion. I think that the funny campaigning of election is very effective in attracting civil attention. Now, in particular, young people are not interested in election. That is very serious problem, so the form of the campaigning should be changed to solve it, I think. In addition, I also learned that propaganda was very important for candidates. For many Ukrainians, the incident is no joking matter, so I expect what he will act to save the life of the Ukrainian people next, too."
6170,"At the beginning, I could not understand what the title means. However, reading the content of the article, I was able to know it and had mixed feelings. This time, a man became Chewbacca which is the character on Election Day. This is very interesting, but not correct as to the election. The man should have thought his own behavior more, I think. This is because ordinary people do not follow such a stupid man. I suppose the election is strict, so I want candidates to do right conduct."
6171,"When I was a junior high and high school student, I learned about the limit of fossil fuels in this world. I had expected that governments all over the world would solve this problem someday in my heart, but this time, I knew that there were not alternatives to fossil fuels after all. That's why I rethink that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, I imaged that China only pollute the air with CO2. However that was wrong, and China use resources effectively such as solar energy. Also, Germany and the UK act to reduce greenhouse emissions, so I thought the Japanese should know the fact and start work for reducing CO2 as a member of society on the earth."
6172,"At first,I can't understand what the article said,because I don't know Star Wars.However, I think that joke candidates like him are not suitable for elections and we should consider the selection when we join it. We can vote next year,so we must judge whether the person I elect is suitable or not and have responsibility for the election. As do so,democracy is stranded up."
6173,"When I read this news story for the first time, I couldn't understand the meaning. And I confused. Because, I did not know that 'Chewbacca' is real or a character. After I understood this meaning, I thought this story is very funny. Because, The Wookiee, the man dressed as Chewbacca, is very crazy. I winder why he did these crazy things. And I think it is funny that the artist turned the statue of Lenin into Darth Vader. I wonder why Internet Party which has candidates who dressed as movie character exist. And I thought it is very funny that 'the Wookiee told local reporters he could not pay as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet' And I was surprised that the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko was re-elected mayor with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Aleksander Borovik. In Japan, some famous people and sport player became a member of the Diet. For example, Inoki who was a professional wrestler is one of a member of the Diet. In this news story, 'Borovik reported on Facebook…' is written. I was surprised those people use SNS to insist their opinion."
6174,"I agree with your opinion that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. If the deterioration of the environment goes on, it influences the lives of next generations, in other words, our descendants. I can't stand the situation that my children or grandchild suffer from environmental issues. Therefore we should discuss a lack of awareness on the part of the persons concerned about environmental issues. I think everyone can do something for reducing CO2 emissions with a conscious effort."
6175,"I was surprised that this question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think the question doesn't have the correct answer. As equality is guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan, every life is equally important, of course. If I am asked the question in the test, I cannot choose whether saving our girl friend or mother from a deadly fire. I don't know system of Chinese law in detail. But, the lawyer needs some knowledge of seeing an issue from various perspectives and thinking equally. This is perfectly reasonable for lawyers in every country. So, it is unsuitable for entering the judiciary and legal profession must pass."
6176,"I don't agree with Bill Gates's point of view. Indeed, as he says, the private sector may be reluctant to produce effective energy alternatives and doesn't contribute to that. However, I don't think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. Of course, the more CO2 a country emits, the more seriously responsible the country is. The way of thinking is natural. Rich countries have to make an effort to reduce that. Yet, the definition of rich countries is not clear. For example, are rising nations included in them? Although they are not called as rich countries, there will be room for reduction in their CO2 emissions. The climate problem has a big impact on the whole world. So I think all countries, not only rich countries, should cooperative to solve the problem. Then, I think the strongest argument against capitalism is that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. It is difficult to receive an enough education and get a job for the poor. Moreover, income redistribution is necessary, but at the same time, economic growth is important for a country. I think the disparity between the rich and the poor will go on widening in the world."
6177,"According to Bill Gates and latest statistics, it is said to be not prevent our earth from global warming under the situation today. In the system of capitalism, the role of companies is to integrate each company's force to pursue their own benefits. Therefore, they don't regard improvement for environment as important thing without the judgement. They only think their self-defense. Certainly, this theory is justice, but even China which was installed capitalism as a fragment of social system is changing their energy system to natural energy. It is too late for the advanced nation like the U.S to change their own thought. They should think 'dismiss the today's benefit, think the future's it'. I hope the change will achieve in the system of capitalism."
6178,"In my opinion, all country should share information about pollution. I didn't know that China has surged ahead of the United States of America and European countries in green investment in spite of being polluting country in terms if fossil fuels. China also puts emphasize in solar energy and the decrease of CO2 emissions. The country's action for global warming has worked well. In addition to China, Germany and the United Kingdom has made great success in decreasing greenhouse emissions. I think all country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and imitate action what those countries has been doing. I agree with the idea of Bill Gates that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, so the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. If such countries decide to work for solving the problem, the entire world will change and get better."
6179,"I agree with you. After reading the article, I was surprised to know that China has been using resources effectively and other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan is relatively rich country, so the country should begin doing action for the decrease of CO2 emissions as a member of the world community. I hope the condition of the earth to get better as soon as possible."
6181,"These days, the gap between the rich and the poor has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Even in Japan, Economic inequality certainly exists. For example, more and more people lose their jobs because of the depression and they have no choice to be on social security for living. Also, it is said that the pension system in Japan seems to collapse in the near future because of aging society. It will be big damage for elderly people. Furthermore, a lot of people who rent student loans when they were university students cannot earn enough money to pay back them. It is because Japanese employment situation is terrible even for those who graduated from four-year universities properly. Moreover, the consumption tax is going to be raised to ten percent from current eight percent. It can be a hard blow to people who are not so rich. In my opinion, Capitalism is an economic system which can make the gap between the rich and the poor larger. As Bill Gates states, the private sector is always thinking their profits, not poor people or the environment in this planet, I think. Also, what is remarkable is that when people in many countries asked if they think the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last, people in Western such as Great Britain, United States of America, and Germany tend to disagree. However, to my surprised, more than half of the people in Asian countries such as India and Thailand answered they agree with this statement. What made them answer so? I guess that almost all the countries in Asia are developing countries. Hence they are able to have a hope toward next generation. Yet, European counties and America are developed countries and probably people living there spend comparatively comfortable lives. However, generally speaking, the world in those days is not good times in good times on a whole. In Japan, after the collapse of overheated stock and real estate markets, the recession has been continued for more than twenty years. Things has become worse and worse. Therefore people in developed countries cannot have a hope to the future. Also there is one more serious problem which must be solved under the corporation of all the human in this world. It is the environmental problem. Since the industry revolution has happened, it goes without saying that the development of the industry can hurt the environment. Because of the dirty air from factories, the cities has been polluted. I must admit that it is essential to make efforts for the development of industry in order to make us richer, but it must not be bad for environment. Too much pollution can kill this planet. As a conclusion, I think it is important to making a lot of products because we can earn money by doing so. But it should be the way where both of poor people and the environment in the Earth aren't be damaged. That's all of my opinion."
6182,"I agree with your opinion. I think that in Japan, the rich can become richer and the poor doesn't even have an opportunity to get rich. Similarly, it is difficult that people who have no opportunity to have a good education get rich now. That's why I also think that such a negative circulation would be repeated many times at this rate. Therefore Japanese government should revise its education system. For example, in Finland, there is no gap, so every child can take the same education. The reason is that the Finnish pay high tax on its education. Moreover, children who have a difficulty in studying can receive cares with special education programs. In addition, teachers there don't have to work for a long time compared with Japan, so the teachers can spare their time for preparing to give good lessons. In conclusion, I think that Japanese government should spend its money not on having achievement tests but on students and teachers."
6183,"This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. The summary that this article wants to tell is, in short, capitalism as an economic system is bad in a sense. According to this article, capitalism brings the poor which lives in developing countries more poverty. I disagree with this opinion. In my opinion, capitalism brings the poor more fortune. For example, Japanese corporations founded factories in China because they could employ Chinese people in low wages. However, the more Chinese people work in Japanese factories, the richer they become. Eventually, Japanese corporations would pay high wages for Chinese people and leave China. Next, they would found new factories in another developing countries. But another developing countries also will become rich. In this sense, capitalism is not eternal. This article and my opinion have this point in common."
6184,"I also think 'the poor get poorer and the rich get richer'. Because, people who have many money can live comfortably, but people who don't have money cannot live comfortably. Because, people who don't have money cannot make their children go to school. In Japan, many children cannot go to a kindergarten. This is big social problem. The government should solve this problem. And I agree with Bill Gates opinion. I think the rich countries - China, America, and Europe and so on-should solve CO2 emissions. Of course Japan too. But this is very difficult problem. Because it costs very much to decrease CO2. And it will take so much time. According to a news on the Internet, Bill Gates plans to make a nuclear reactor. When I read this article, I thought he contradict himself. He said that the countries should decrease CO2, but he is about to make a things which makes the environment dirty and world dangerous. I cannot believe and understand him. Japanese people knew a danger of a nuclear reactor from Tohoku earthquake. We do not want to have a nightmare."
6185,"I agree with your opinion. I learned that 'all people are equal' in my class. We are all equal, so we cannot decide which live is important or precious. I was surprised this question. If I was the person who take a test, I could not answer this. Does this question has right answer? It is very difficult."
6186,"Me too. I also could not understand the meaning, when I first read this headline. Because I was confused that 'Chewbacca' is real or movie character. I think your opinion - he would like to appeal to public for something - is interesting. After I read your comment, I think so too. If this opinion is right, he is not nice. The election should be serious. Because the election is the thing that decide this county's future. If he wants to appeal his policy, he play fair without dressing movie character."
6187,"I agree with your opinion strongly.Because Nobel Peace Prize winners have broken many peace, Someone will say that they are not suitable for Nobel Peace Prize. However are there the people who don't make mistakes? The answer of this question is NO. Therefore I think also Nobel Peace Prize should be given to not people who committed to peace but to the action of protecting peace."
6188,I agree with you. the National Judicial Exam's Question is the question' whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not'. His action of saving girlfriend is amounted to a criminal failure because Confucianism is the religion that children must serve their parents more than other people. However this custom is too bad and too old nowadays because now all people is equal to all people.Therefore the answer of the question 'Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire' should depend on personal value.
6189,"I heard that the origin of Nobel Prize is that when Nobel invented dynamites for creating tunnel easily, people used them to kill people and Nobel made his own prize with money he earned by dynamite to contribute the society. Actually I think President Obama doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. What he said does deserve but what he actually does doesn't deserve it. However, when I recall the origin of Nobel Prize I thought that sometimes what people meant to do is different what other people can see. for the people who is killed by dynamite, Nobel was killer even though it was not he meant to do. I thought perhaps President Obama might be the same. I don't agree what he did and it is true that seeing is believing but we shouldn't forget that sometimes saying is worth believing."
6190,"This article is very difficult for me. When I first read this article, I was surprised to know that China emits CO2 so much and surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. At first, I didn't know Bill Gates. I learned he is an American businessman and found the Microsoft. I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I praised his charity action because he contributes his own money for energy. I agree with his idea that substantial carbon tax is essential for innovators or energy buyers to change energy source. However, economic system is very complexity, so we should think carefully. In the capitalism society, the poor get poor and the rich get richer. I think capitalism is not so good because this system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society, it is very difficult to retrieve his or her former position and return to the community. I think we ought to reconsider about the future energy carefully and suggest the innovatory economic plan in order to succeed in the future. In addition, this problem is an international problem, so people all over the world should consider it carefully and work on together."
6191,"I agree with your idea. The gap between rich people and poor people is not good in Japan. We should reconsider the system of capitalism carefully. In addition, energy problem is serious in the world. This is a worldwide problem, so the rich country lead the world, and not only the rich countries but also the poor country discuss and work on together. International cooperation is also important."
6192,"When I read this news, I was surprised and incomprehensible. I didn't know character of Star Wars so I can't understood Chewbacca. But I read carefully and I understood it. It's that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election."
6193,"I think that Bill's idea is creative and I agree with his thought. Especially, I was impressed by the opinion that rich countries like the US, China and Europe have to solve the climate problem. Most climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan. For these countries, economic development is priority over climate problem. On the contrary, this means climate problem will be solved if these countries make an effort saving CO2. Now, capitalism rethink these problem."
6194,"I knew that two Japanese men were awarded the Nobel Prize this year, but I do not know this quartet of group from Tunisia were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The winners of the Nobel Prize in chemistry and Physics are mostly make a remarkable and clear achievement. But there are sometimes both pros and cons as to the winners of it in Peace. Actually some winners of Nobel Peace prize still do not solve the problems and achieve true peace. In addition, some winners did military attacks. I think it wrong to resort to violence with an excuse to realize peace, and it is not appropriate for the winners of Nobel Peace Prize. I don't want the Nobel Peace Prize to be an award in name only."
6195,"I agree with idea that rich country like China, Europe, America has to solved the environmental problem.But it is not only rich countries problem.Of course,some climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan.However,only rich countries effort are short-handed. All of the world should make an effort to decrease CO2.I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy.People should make an effort to wrestle environmental problem not to say Bill Gates. And the problem that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer is there in Japan too.For example,there are people who haven't problem for entering college and who have problem for entering college in class because there are poverty and wealth in these parents.Possibly compared with worlds poverty and wealth , Japanese poverty and wealth is not particular serious problem.But in fact,a middle-class family became gradually a lower-class family in Japan.Japanese government should take steps to deal with poverty and wealth problem and environmental problem."
6196,"When I read the news that a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine on Sunday after he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, I am very surprised. This is because I do not know there is the legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. I have not watched the movie of Star Wars yet. I wanted to watch this movie to read this news. I am sure that Chewbacca is the very important character in the story. He may save the peace of space."
6197,"I have heard Bill Gates but I didn't know him. I agree his idea that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. In Japan, a sign of the CO2 reduction was put up by the Kyoto Protocol, but we haven't achieved the aim yet.Thermal power generation is still a main generation method. generation using a natural energy is difficult from cost and the problem of the place. However, the improvement of system which a great capitalist like Bill Gates can invest in generation is important one of the solution to this problem."
6198,"I agree with your opinion. In Japan, it is true that the poor gets poorer, and poor families are always in the negative chain, I feel. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who live in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows, and so on."
6199,"I agree with your thoughts. I had not known about the news, too. We in Japan live in peace, but our living is unusual, I realized. Also, I felt that Nobel Peace Prize is not true award for peace, too. In Tunisia and some other countries, much terrorism occurs now, and these countries' economy is bad. I think that to get rid of a gap between citizens and their government would make the bad conditions better. In brief, to meet halfway each other is first step for solving the problem."
6202,"China is a country which is developing now, but therefore China has many problems about environment such as Co2, air pollution, pm2.5. I really agree with Gates's argument. I think the man who has power like him should say his opinion because it will change the individual mind in the world for CO2 problems effectively."
6203,"I agree with your opinion and I think so too. I think it is impossible to judge which value of the life is better, and human beings are correctly equality. So we should share the thinking not to discriminate the human beings by sex all over the world!"
6204,"At first, I was very surprised when I heard this news. Because I thought that Novel peace prize winners should be praised all over the world and they have a stable position. After that I thought it is very difficult for me to judge whether Novel peace prize winners are completely adequately or not, because I can not imagine. We should not pay attention to only Novel peace prize winners' achievements and we should pay attention to those backgrounds too. If we can do that Novel peace prize's value become more superior thing. And Novel peace prize winners will be respected by more people, I think. From now on, I want to think world's peace more, and pay attention to Novel peace prize's news carefully."
6205,"I agree with your opinion, and I think so too. I had not thought about Novel peace prize's worth enough. So I thought that Novel peace prize winners should be respected all over the world and they have a stable position. But I noticed that its thinking is very shallow and not completely. And you said that you want Novel committee to have a discussion carefully about a candidate is really should be awarded the prize or not, its opinion is true I think. After that not only Novel committee but we should pay attention to movement about Novel peace prize winners, I think."
6206,"If I must choose my mother or someone essential for me in emergency, I think the choice is up to the situation. However, to tell the truth, I cannot decide to chose one and leave the other, so I cannot understand the judgement that saving a girlfriend, not mother is a crime. I think that all lives should be treated equally without taking it consider that mother is family and that girlfriend is not. In Japan, this point that a person in emergency decides who he or she should save rarely become a big problem. So what people regard as important is depends on the national characteristics. It seems that people in foreign countries tend to spend much time with their family while Japanese people spend not so much. I think Japanese are too busy for their work or disinterested in their family. Now this is also a serious problem."
6207,"When I read this article,I was very surprised because I have never heard that politician dressed in costume of anime character like Chewbacca.I can't believe the politician behave like that.I think the politician is serious and it's way of thinking is hard.So,I found his action a bit interesting.His action may break the stereotype for politics in Japan.But,in this time, the problem is that his action broke legislation that forbidden on campaigning on Election day.The idea was good,but we should conserve the law.And also,his excuse was terrible.'My funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.'Children can understand it is a lie.Even if we want to do the remarkable action,I think we should obey law as an adult. On the other hand,the image of politics should be improve.In Japan,it has been said that the decline of voting rate becomes the problem.The main reason is that young people aren't interested in politics.I think the unique way of campaign is good as long as it dose not break legislation."
6208,"I think that his attitude toward politics was bad.In addition,his stupid excuse was really unbelievable.He did a thing that he should not do as a politician,as an adult.Even if he want to campaign in unique way,he should've conserve the law.However,this evidence may attract young people who has been interested in politics.When I read this article,I imagine d if the situation happened.Young people in Japan may come to concern about politics,and the low voting rate may be improved."
6212,"I agree with your feeling. I could not also believe this article when I read it for the first time. In addition, I thought that the joke candidates would attract young people at first, but on second thoughts, candidates can become national leaders, so I think the citizens cannot rely on such a candidate. For attracting young people to elections, I think it is wrong to make a joke and get votes. After all, if the joking candidate will be elected, young people would lose interest right away, and other citizens would not go along with him or her easily."
6213,"I agree with your opinion. The question about choosing girlfriend or mother in the case of fire is so difficult, and nobody can find its answer, I thought. Also, in the same as your opinion, everyone on the earth cannot decide the value of others, I think. In addition, I felt the fact that the exam of public asks the question to examinees is specifically wrong. However, in fact, I might be forced to save someone instead of others someday, so I think that I continue to be troubled throughout all my life."
6214,"I don't agree with your opinion that the candidates are fool and it is extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. Just like a party expresses itself for votes by holding up own campaign agenda and making a canvass of a neighborhood freely in democracy, I think a use of character costumes is also one of the way to do so. Although you say it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is, I don't think that existence of such candidates means Ukraine is not peaceful country. However, if the motivation for the joke style is not relevant to the politics, I can't support the party. They should have their own political intentions."
6215,"I disagree with the opinion that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. It is fact that the poor get poor. However it is not impossible for the poor to be rich. There is the way how the poor become rich.For example it is a certified public accountant. You can take a certified public accountant examination anytime. In other words you can take the examination even if you do not graduate from a high school and a university. Generally, if you are rich, you can receive a good education.Regardless of educational background, Anyone can challenge it.To be rich, the poor have to study harder than the rich. If you make efforts and have strong will, you can fulfill your dream.Even if you are poor, there is not dreams that you can not fulfill. The rich tend to waste their money. Since they have much money, they can take a good education.and enter the first-class university. I think that it is important to invest property in their own dreams. It makes no sense if they can not manage money well.In this way,the thought that 'the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies' is wrong. I hope that the poor will spend rich life. In capitalism economy, society should be formed to protect the weak."
6216,"I think this exam is illegal for two points. First, human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. Second, anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind. By the way, I don't have girlfriend for now. Therefore I think this question is an incentive one, too."
6217,"I think that this news is regrettable for three reasons. Firstly, I don't understand why they changed their name only for the election? I think that it is not necessary to change their name related to Star Wars for politics. Second, it is indicated that the confusion of Ukrainian politics. Nothing to say, there are many politic scandals in Japan, but I think that I have never heard that politicians really change their name into character's name. Badly, the name Chewbacca and Darth Vader are too known to all over the world, so this news became the topic. Finally, it is no symptoms to solve this political confusion in Ukraine. To sum up, I hope that this kind of scandals won't happen again."
6218,"I had thought the person who get Novel Prize has to move toward disarmament or try to keep world peace. But after reading this article, I had doubt that thinking. At the end of this article, Henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin are introduced as a person who were nominated Nobel prize.When I was a high school student in historical class, I learned about these people's act. I had a very bad image of these people such like unjust, cruel and evil. Because they killed many people and expand armaments. Hitler had massacre Jews. Stalin killed all the people who defy his order. According to this article, Kissinger actually was 'implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America'. Therefore I thought why they are nominated in the past. i think there are a lot of people who are more suitable nominated Novel Prize than them. I do not really know about the choosing system in Novel prize. But from now on, the system should be reexamined. If people receive Novel prize, they can take a lot of money. Those money should be used to keep our world peace. So the prize winner should be chosen more carefully than before."
6219,"I understand the climate change is a big problem in the world now. My image of Bill Gates is very smart. He says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change because the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. I agree with his opinion. To produce effective energy will need a lot of costs. Now, CO2 emission became a serious problem in the world, also in Japan. Few years ago, the Japan government announced the target figure about CO2 emission but in real, we could not limit the emission. This is difficult to solve. I think also the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. The rich countries such as China and the US and Europe should think about climate change deeply."
6220,"I think a man being a candidate as Darth Vader has a good sense of humour, so the Chewbacca is. It can be possible when the election is in Russia, moreover,outside of Japan seen from the point of view of Japanese citizen.We see the generosity in them, but when it comes to politics, we have to ponder to whom we vote, since it directly relates to our lives. What improves our quality of life is the government but the same as who ruin it. To add, what is funny is that the fine is just $8, and he pursued his characteristics that he's from Star Wars, saying ' his bank has no branches on this planet'."
6221,"I think this problem is related to 'What is peace?'. There are two kinds of peace: that by using armed forces or that by not using it. The former can be expected to be effective immediately, but make a sacrifice without exception. On the other hand, the latter takes a long time, but does not make a sacrifice. No one can say whether is better, so no one can give the right answer about who is worthy to be awarded the Nobel peace prize. It is nothing but a symbol of peaceful thinking, is not involved in the result of the actions."
6222,"I agree with Bill Gates' perception about capitalism and money in the future. Certainly, as we can see, capitalism and countries that introduced capitalism have succeeded to rule the most of the world. They, or to say 'we'?, have exploited the poorer and ignored their condemnation. In the middle-east, The innocent citizens are bombed and killed by many rich countries just because of their selfish will that they need oil power and right to keep their QOL average. They also cause damage and make earth cry so that abnormal climate changes and phenomenon happen recently. We should seriously consider about saving energy and source that scarcely exist on earth. Some associations and NGOs are making efforts but the top of the world doesn't correctly serve its main function. The world is always in someone's hand and under minority's envy. There is a notion so called minimalist, and I strongly believe that we must give a shot on it. We also should invent new technology that saves energy for green environment."
6224,"I agree with Bill Gate's opinion. The climate problem must be solved by the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. They have to take the lead in reducing carbon emissions. And since I had an strong image of China as the polluting country, I was very surprised to know China had surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. And I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. For example, it costs much money to give children a good education. An well educated person could get a better paying job. Moreover when we start a business, we are required a capital. Sadly the rich have more chances to make money than the poor. I can accept the fact that most developed countries were also less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement 'the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last'. But I think there is more room for prospering in developing countries."
6225,"I think so,too. Mother is our only one for everyone. Because she always support us when we feel sad,lonely and happy. She shear our feel at any moment. On the other hand, girlfriend is our only one,too. A girlfriend is a person that you love each other. And you find treasure. So this question is too difficult to answer."
6226,I agree with your opinion that China has many problems. Pm2.5 flows from China to Japan. I think we face a crisis of climate change. So I agree with Gate's ideas. Private sectors are very important for climate.
6227,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. This problem is very difficult. I think this problem has no answer. Because human life is equal. The person who wants to protect mother should protect mother, the person who wants to protect girlfriend should protect girlfriend, The person who is not which should protect the person who was in the place. Now, I don't have girlfriend so my answer is protect my mother. But if I get girlfriend, I may can not answer this problem."
6228,"I was surprised with this news and I just cannot accept such a joking candidate. Even though it seems the candidate attracts attentions from a lot of people, I think they can be generous only because it is other people's affairs. If a candidate in my own city or country begins saying such things, I strongly reject. I do not want him to represent us. If he wins the election and becomes the president, I do not think any other organizations will trust him. I want more people to take this news seriously and report this carefully. When people think this matter more, there will be a lot of different opinions to discuss and in that way, more people will be interested in political matters."
6229,"I think Nobel Peace Prize has two difficult points. First, the criterion of this prize is very vague. In other Nobel Prizes we can understand why the winners get the prize, that is to say, there are clear reasons of the prize. On the other hand, the Peace Prize's standard acquired to be awarded is very vague and sometimes there is not clear reason. Moreover, a number of the winner of this prize is famous people such as Sato Eisaku and Barack Obama. Therefore I consider it is more difficult to win the prize than the other prizes for common people and this prize depend more largely on the sign of world peace than congratulating one person. However I afraid that the criterion becomes vaguer to show us more peaceful acts and make the prize's value abase. Second, as the article, the prize is to go to people working for disarmament and against militarism, but arms are often used to make the aim come true. I think it is anti-logy. Is to bring lasting peace to the world equal to getting rid of weapons from the world? I believe Barack Obama who was the winner of this prize and bombed in Afghanistan is unworthy of the prize. Such a person shouldn't be awarded and if the winner do an act inapt, he should give back the prize. As just described, the Nobel Peace Prize has hard points. I want the prize keep trying."
6230,"I think this tests have two problems. One is that human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. The other is that anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind."
6232,"I understand what Bill Gates was trying to say, but the world is under the system of capitalism for now and we have to seek ways to improve. Nothing will be solved if you criticize. However, it is true that developed countries are not doing enough and I think it is because people do not feel a sense of crisis. In fact, we are not having troubles or difficulties to lead our lives. I agree with the voices of surveys in the article. I also felt that countries with large populations should take the initiative to solve the environmental problem. Now, as discussed in the article, developed countries not only act in a corrupted manner but also help developing countries to become like them. For example, they introduce how to exploit a vast area in developed countries. We should find a way to coexist with nature."
6236,"When I read this article at first, I was very surprised. I think amusements mustn't come into the politics. If the representative of the Ukraine's Internet Party wearing Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine get himself out of the costume, will the citizen agree with and give support to him? Probably, he would be not able to receive attentions because the popularity of him will depends on the looks which is very famous characters' largely. Also, in Japan such a thing appear recently. For example, Higashikokubaru Hideo who was the governor of Miyazaki prefecture and Tani Ryoko who is a member of the Diet. I consider that they won an election thanks to their name recognition, that is to say, if the citizens had not known about them at all and watch them for the first time in the election, they may be not elected to the political job. Therefore, the name recognition is very dangerous in the election. It derange our right thinking. We must pay attention to not its looks but content of the policy. Not only such a thing, candidates should avoid dirty tactics. Nevertheless the resignation of the former president after Euromaidan revolution, close ties with Russia wasn't dissolved in the last election. This means the election didn't reflect popular willingness and there were frauds. I want politicians to be honest and to work hard to make their own countries better. The politics which contradict citizen's assertions don't mean anything. I wish the style of Ukrainian politics is improved without further delay. Politics must be conducted seriously because it decide the future of countries. Of course, the conductor of politics must be elected seriously, too. Thus, using own name value or dirty tactics are politically incorrect and we must take care of them."
6239,"I agree with your idea. Even in Japan, there are still gaps between the rich and the poor, and there are some problems of social security. If we lose our job, it is difficult to back to the previous job. In addition, there are many problems of elderly people such as pension, medical services, nursing services, and also problems of young people such as child-rearing support. For example, the problems of a waiting children on the list, early-education and so on. Moreover, these days, the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Consumption Tax will be raised to 10% in April 2017. Consumption Tax is related to our dairy life, so we cannot be avoided and passed by sidestepped confusion. However, I think the increase of consumption tax is necessary. There are some reasons. First, until now, consumption tax has been covered half of the social security expenses, so if the consumption tax will be increased, the raising income of tax increased will be used for the stabilization of social security. That is to say, the tax increase will make our life better. The second reason is that the raising income of tax increased will make tax revenue become stable, so this will be connected to the Japanese economic growth. Comparing with other country, Japanese consumption tax is not so high. For example, Sweden, Denmark, Norway's consumption tax is 25% and this is the highest rates in the world. In addition, The Korea and China's consumption tax is higher than Japan. From these reasons, I think Japan should raise consumption tax. As this article shows, there are some environment problems such as dirty air and industrial pollution in the world. I also think not only the rich country but also the poor country ought to consider these problems and think the best way for the earth in the future."
6240,"Donald Trump used a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on. When I read this article for the first time, I agree with his opinion because I was afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates, or other immigrants. However, in thinking about his statements, I noticed that he thought about the safety of only his country, but we all should think about all people's safety &amp; happiness. According to Tom Brokaw, who was an anchorman of NBC, it is significant to understand Islamic estates at first. Most of people don't try to understand them, so everyone should do this, I feel. Needless to say, I will also try to do so."
6241,"This news story is related to an argument about running for the mayor under the false name. The advantage of this is that the citizens can feel close to the election. Due to a familiar name, they get interested in the election, and read a manifesto. This will be connected with a lively democracy. In other hand, such an action lacks sincerity. originally, politics should be sacredness because politics affects our way of life. Are you sure that such an action is permitted? I think that it should not be permitted. We vote for the person whom we want to trust, so a candidate must show who himself or herself is openly. Name is important when we evaluate them. Certainly, there are some statesmen who use false name in Japan (for example,Mr. Antonio Inoki). But they acted under the name, and are famous for the name, so their name remind of himself or herself. In this news story, we cannot recognize him in 'Chewbacca', so he should not use the false name."
6242,"I was impressed with your opinion. It is true that we need to prepare money before thinking about what we can do with environmental issues. However, I do not have any ideas to help poor people getting poorer. The system gets so complex and even charity activities are not reliable. People has no or a little interest to each other and you might not notice if your neighbor dies alone. I think we need to fix not only the system but also the way people feel. I think reaching to a world where people can compassionate towards others is the closest way to solve any of worldwide issue."
6243,"I understand what you would like to say. It is really difficult to judge who has done the best to maintain the peace in the world. I know that some of the actions of President Obama leads to deaths of innocent people as written in the article, but he got the Novel Prize in 2009 for what he has done. It was assessed by the world. Probably Obama and all the other winners of Novel Prize are not perfect, but I do not think it is awkward that those people are awarded and nobody has the right to take it away from them."
6244,"I also felt this question and the way examiners treated people who answered girlfriend are just ridiculous. If I were the one who answered girlfriend, I cannot tolerate for losing points with my answer. There are a lot of ways of thinking, and examiners should score with respect. The standard for scoring must be how logical the students support their choices. But before talking about the way they scored, I wonder if this is a suitable question when considering of rights of all the people. On the other hand, I think it is really natural that nobody cares about the sexual problem because the question is just on the assumption."
6247,"I think that his offensive speech is a strategy.When his speech listen people that have complain,they feel that he think us and reject other people and deliver us from hardship.Then,these people support Mr Tramp.I think that these are his aim."
6249,"I think the reason why such as Chewbacca appeared in campaigning on election day, the symbol of peoples anxiety. People of Ukraine have big doubt to their politics. In the last paragraph, in this news, the local elections were written as a unreliable thing because of traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals. It seem difficult for me Ukrainian government to recreate new reliable politics. But they must introduce 'really reliable politics' for people in Ukrainian. They are afraid of their politics. If the government does not try and success to introduce new politics, they cause a revolution again for their dissatisfaction of politics. The government should try to hold fair election and people choose appropriate and reliable man as a mayor who can have a power to change their politics."
6250,"I agree your opinion. As you say, the action of a man dresses as Chewbacca is contrary to democracy. It's important for nations that candidates reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy."
6251,"I was surprised when I heard this news on TV. Now, terrorism is very dangerous problem for all over the world. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. In real some Japanese people were killed and many people were killed by terrorism attack by Islamic estates. The ban of Muslim immigration may be one of the way to defend terrorism but I agree with Hillary Clinton. She said ''Hate is not an American value'' on twitter. I think Donald Trump's plan is not solution for terrorism of Islamic estates. Some people of Islam may sad for terrorism as many people. We should understand the state of Islam. America is the country that many different immigration lives so that it is more important."
6252,"I was surprised at this question. I think the felling that he want to help his girlfriend is as important as want to help his mother. Preciousness of life is not changed for everyone. So, it is natural that this result is controversial. Furthermore, the gender discrimination problem is also serious. Women is not assumed that the answer. If there is a woman that if received the test, she would have thought uncomfortable. Also, in Japan, lawyers and doctors are likely assumed men. We need to go to change the consciousness for the society that women can success more."
6253,"I think so too. If I was faced with the circumstances his mother and lover is dying at the same time , it will can not help calm. So,this question does not have meaning to think. In addition, I think that it is unscrupulous itself that such a question in the national examination. They should reconsider the way of test."
6254,"I think so too. The problem choosing his mother or his girlfriend doesn't have the answer. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to determined. And, we of course want to help both of them. So, we should think how to help all if think."
6255,"I was surprised that such a thing had been happened in reality. When I saw the picture first, I think why the character of Star Wars is there. It's interesting. But, I can't agree with them. It's politically exploit the popularity of Star Wars if it is not a joke. The most problem is that there are many people who had voted for them. However, recently, voter turnout has decreased. So, it might be good to collect the interest. For democracy, it is not allowed to be indifferent. Soon we become to be able to vote from the age of 18 in Japan. We should think the way to vote and politics."
6259,"I cannot agree with the Novel Prize. I read this news, first I thought offensive. I assent to Moreton's opinion. America was attacked by Afghanistan with Obama receive Nobel Prize. But, that was very good news that quartet of groups was receive Nobel Prize. The Financial Times wrote that only success story of the Arab Spring. I sympathized that phrase. It is very good sentence. There is the chosen thing while there is good Nobel Prize though it is a lie. Who choose it? I do not know any details about that. Of course, I do not know how to choose the Nobel Prize. I think that this must not happen. (111words)"
6261,"I think that we must not use fossil fuels. Because, fossil fuels is limit. And if we generate electricity by electricity with fossil fuel, then it exhausts carbon dioxide in large quantities. So, we should use green energy. Green energy has various kinds: solar energy and wind power or etc… But it costs much money to diffuse it. The future biggest problem will be a problem of the money. Therefore, Bill Gates contributed much money is very awesome thinking. I do not contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money. I will spend all money for oneself. However, he gave away all his money to charity. What is he going to do by the charity? I expect that he helps for making new energy. As well as it, he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide. Increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem. Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. We must stop the rise in temperature immediately. To that end, I hope that people thinking about society than oneself increase more. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment. (207 word)"
6262,"I read this news. First I thought that the Ukrainian is very unique country. Recent days, Star Wars is very trendy movie. But I did not watch the Star Wars, so I did not understand all of this news. However, I know Sith and Darth Vader or etc… So I was easy to read. It is news handled as a comedy in the world, but I think that it is serious news. The Ukrainian resists the government. They did repulsion to the living government. But I think that their idea is very interesting. It becomes the news by all means. If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. However, we must not be arrested. As a result, would their action be right? I was not able to win in the election for mayor, may there not be a meaning? I think that it is enough just to have been able to show intention to object to the present government in the world. (166 words)"
6264,"I think that the idea which the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies is right too. That's because I knew that there are children who cannot study enough due to poor in Japan through the TV program. Their family have to use their money for the livelihood, so they cannot use for the education. And, the children probably should work to live instead of studying for examination to enter universities. So, they cannot study enough and get a job with enough money. That is the vicious circle. We should break the circle. Otherwise, the gap between rich and poor become more and more spread. I would like Japanese government to make the useful plan to eliminate the disparities"
6265,"I agree with your opinion. I also learned about the limit of fossil fuels, when I was a junior high and high school student. And the problem about CO2 emission is so serious. If the counties which emit much green gas emissions should not reduce it, the global warming will progress more and more. China and other countries should use resources effectively such as solar energy. And we Japanese also should reduce the CO2 emissions and make efforts to solve the environment problems."
6266,"The first point. I heard this news on TV at first, I cannot believe and was laugh. 'Wow there are a lot of people all over the world, but like this political party may be not bad .'I thought at that time. But,if Japan has such a political party,what do I think? I think that I can't trust such a political party. Why? Because such a political party people do think about our nation?! I think that they think their own way. For example, their entertainment or amusement. Who can depend on our nation such a political party's candidate? I can't depend on them. The second point,He did not pay funds. It's only 8 dollars. He broke legislation that forbids campaign, but even so he refused to pay funds. Though imperfect , he is a nation 's representative , in good faith he should pay. But No! Faith! He broke legislation so he should pay! Nevertheless he did not have money because his bank does not exist on earth. I can't believe!"
6267,"I agree with your opinion in the point that all countries should cooperative to solve the problem about CO2 emissions. When I saw the date about CO2 emissions, the US and China occupy 50% rate of all emissions in the world. However, China is not a developed country, so it is difficult to regulation. Even so, China should make an effort to reduce the CO2 emissions to solve this problem. We have to conceive the way how people of various positions agree with the issue. For that, I'd like to focus on the movement of each country."
6268,"I agree with your opinion. I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy too. In the spring semester, we learned the news about the Picasso's picture. In that, we thought the how the rich should use their money. There are many ways, however, his act is one of the respectful ways. I think, the idea the poor get poor and the rich get richer in the capitalism society is right. So, the rich should have a broad vision, and conceive the poor and the whole society."
6270,"Certainly, Donald J. Trump should be criticized in terms of humanitarianism. But we have to remember that today there is a worldwide fashion for ultra-conservatism or xenophobia. For example, in December the far-right National Front made big gains in the first round of France's regional elections due to the wake of last month's terror attacks in Paris. After all, National Front did not get enough votes to shift the balance of power in the second round of election. Although National Front was defeated in the election, we have to pay attention to people's hate against foreigners. About 80 years ago, ultraconservative leaders came into existence in each country due to the Great Depression. I'm not necessary going to deny all of the leaders' policies, but I think that racism should be blamed. In a sense, People's hate against foreigners promoted the World War II. Therefore Trump's proposal should be blamed. If Trump become the President of USA, not only American but also people worldwide will be unhappy. I want Trump to become a comedian instead of the President."
6271,"When I watched the news on TV for the first time, I was very surprised because I doubted that he went out of his mind. Of course, I am afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. However I think his statement is disqualification as a presidential candidate because perhaps his statement stimulates Islamic estates and lead another terrorism. Terrorism is serious problem all over the world now, and it is difficult to solve this problem. I think his statement is not solution for terrorism. Therefore we should face this problem actively."
6272,"I agree with your opinion. The answer of China's Ministry of Justice depends on personal sense of values. Certainly, we are brought up by mothers and have longer relationship than girlfriends. But, People's lives are equal. Even a girlfriend is the one of important people. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically."
6273,"I did not know this news that some of the Novel Peace Prize winners were unaccepted their award until I read this article. I also think that selecting Novel Peace Prize has some problems. First, the criterion and reason of choosing Novel Peace Prize is very uncertain. We can understand the reason the winners of Novel prize in Physics and Medicine and so on are selected the awards. But, we sometimes do not know why the winners of Novel Peace Prize get the prize. Second, the war gives rise to the winner and the loser. So, I think that person who is related with war and battle must not get the Novel Peace Prize. In other words, we cannot measure the peace. Justice differs from person to person. I suppose I have no choice but to have this problem but I do not want the Novel Peace Prize to be in name only."
6274,"You felt surprised when you read this article. I felt the same as you about that. You wrote that mother and girl friend are even ground. I thought that too!! Mother gave birth to me, so mother is person that it is very important for me. In contrast, girl friend is a favorite person. The nature fades especially in comparison with mother. But, I may become person that it will be important in the future. I do not think that all the people are equal. Some of them are important but others are not. But I am not available in girl friend with mother. China's institution is bad. We demand the change of the Chinese system. In addition, I think that there is a way in itself mistake of the Chinese country. For example, it is Disney, Doraemon, Konan, or etc… It is called by Paprika. China should review all the society. (152 words)"
6275,"I thought that very surprised too. You wrote Novel peace prize winners should be praised all over the world and they have a stable position. I thought that too. I do not know that how to decide the prize winner. I thought that they were chosen fairly and definitely. It could not be said that it was wrong, but it followed that you must doubt it. I can't say that all their opinions are wrong. But A should return the Nobel Prize. And you said that Novel peace prize winners will be respected by more people. It is true. Nobel peace prize winner is respected by all of the people. So I will think that the prize winner of Nobel peace prize has to choose you carefully in future. Who will win it in the next fiscal year? I am really looking forward to that. (145words)"
6276,"I agree with Bill Gates. It is because that the global environment is serious now. How to deal with environmental pollution is a serious matter. You wrote that I had a strong image of China as the polluting country. I thought that too. China's image is very bad. There is very much quantity of China's exhaust gas. If thought of China does not change, the environmental problem is not solved. You think that the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. It is true. But, I think that it is good. Because, the person does not grow up in the society that everybody is equal. If a person changed the social origin into does not appear, the earth will decline. In other words you should make a genius even if there is the difference. Because Nietzsche of a famous philosopher says, I think this to be right. (150 words)"
6277,"I agree with Bill Gates' opinion about capitalism in the future. Now, unusual climate change and global warming and so on are a big problem all over the world. In the past, the U.S., the U.K., Japan and others put national economic growth before the global environment. These countries did not completely take a global view of the environment. In the result, abnormal climate changes are more serious year by year. So, I think the order of priority of this issue is high. Also, when I read this article, I was quite expected that China has surged ahead of the U.S. and Europe in green investment despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. And, I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist economy. This problem may be a natural consequence in capitalism. But, if the government do not stop the vicious downward spiral caused by the gap widening society, the gap between the rich and the poor will widens more and more. I think the education gap is especially very serious matter. Japanese government should cope with these problems to preserve capitalism and global environment."
6279,"When you read this article, you were surprised. When I read this article, I felt surprised and I laughed. I did not know star wars, so I did not know Chewbacca. I was surprised when there was a person dressed in the clothes that it was strange in the world. But, they would want to tell. In fact they attracted attention of the world. Everybody gives an example of the Japanese Government. In this way, they gave the opportunity when we thought about politics. I regret that he was caught by the police. But, I think that they had a big influence on the world. (105words)"
6281,"I did not know the news until I have read the article. Only I knew about the Nobel Prize in 2015 was that Mr.Kajita and Mr.Omura got the prize. I think, the Nobel Prize has some problems. First, we don't understand it enough. For example, the fields are professional and difficult for the public. Consequently, we cannot understand the criteria for selection. So, the committee should explain clarity the reason for the prize. In this case, the matter is opaqueness of the reason for award. It is necessary to ensure transparency and to convince a lot of people. Second, they have to consider from various positions in particular the Peace Prize. If one is honored among the position that is hostile, conflict would become more terrible. Indeed, we have to try to know about the Nobel Prize more. Through it, we should know the news in the world."
6285,"I also disagree with Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigrations. I have three reasons. The first one is that all Muslim immigrants are not awful radicals.We tend to have images that Muslims are scary from terrorism,but Muslim is a religion that followers believes in Allah , angels , worships, and fast so on.So every Muslim followers do not have Islamic fundamentalism.I heard that parts of them hate fundamentalism. The second one is that there are some people who really want to run away from their own countries to USA.If USA decide to ban all Muslim immigration,Muslims who are good-natured will be persecuted,and they will be treated as well as fundamentalists.In addition to these points , they will not be able to live peacefully because of the dangerous same family .So it is important for us to recognize the difference between fundamentalists and the others. The third one is that decision may give possibilities that the other countries refuse to receive immigrations.USA is known as a country that has liberty ideology, receives many immigrants from all over the world .So USA decision to reject immigrants may lead to the situation that countries begin to hesitate to introduce immigrations.I think USA should be the model of liberty and diversity. In Obama's speech ,I heard sentences that in spite of appearances ,hometowns,families and religions ,our liberty relates one another. We do not dislike Muslim because of their own religion ,but think what we should do to prevent terrorism. I give some concrete plans to prevent terrorism.When some big games are held ,many policemen should check people carefully. Watching cameras should be set many places and police keeps on watching."
6286,I think your opinion is very sharp. It is very difficult to define the meaning of peace. I think we should consider about 'What is peace?' seriously. It is problem that the system of choosing Novel Prize is not clear and vague. Some winners resort to military force and still do not resolve the problems. I hope that the Novel Peace Prize will be in name only.
6287,"I agree with you. The system of capitalism that the poor get poorer and rich get richer may be natural result. But, the Japanese government should seek the improvement of the social security system to stop to widen the gap between the richer and poorer. And, the energy problem is serious all over the world. Not only rich countries but poor countries should cooperate in dealing with this issue in the future."
6290,"Before I read this article, I thought the Nobel peace prize is a holy and great prize. But, I changed my thought when I finished reading it. I noticed an inconsistency of the Nobel peace prize. It is the fact that Alfred Nobel himself manufactured dynamite. Dynamite is the weapon of indiscriminate murder. So, I wonder the basis of this prize. By the way, this article focused the fact of the National Dialogue Quartet giving the Nobel peace prize. This commendation might not be the right act. But, I feel pitiful for other people who awarded the prize. If such an incident occurred again, the organization will change their standards of selection. I think that this incident caused decreasing the trust of the committee of Nobel. This article says Obama won the prize in 2009. I feel indignation for it. I want the committee to think seriously. Also, Hitler and Stalin were nominated. I do not know this meaning. I agree to what Moreton said. I think that we should abolish this prize."
6291,"I have the same opinion. The Nobel committee gave the prize to Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, but they did not success. So, they couldn't have been prized. I cannot understand the reason. We say the same things for Hitler and Stalin. I think that the committee should apologize to other great winners."
6292,"I disagree with Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration. At first, his plan is based on racism and inhumane. We should not discriminate people by race, religion and color. In addition, his plan is not rational. Because Muslim is originally far from radical ideas such as acting terrorism. It is strange to think that all Muslims are radical people by seeing few Muslims acting radically. Although his plan is based on racism and inhumane, many people support it. It seems many supports reflect real intention of white Americans. If his plan comes true, another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WWⅡ. Surely, we are afraid of terrorism. But, we should not discriminate people by religion. So that, we should find suitable way to prevent terrorism without racism."
6293,"I agree with your opinion. Recently in Japan, it is true that the poor gets poor and poor families are always in the negative chain. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who live in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows."
6294,"Because I had never watched Star Wards before when I first read this article, I wasn't able to understand what was happening. But, I was interested in Star Wards and watched all series because the new movie was released last month. I thought it was very strange that Chewbacca was allegedly campaigning for Darth Vader and was thrown over a police car and handcuffed after knowing the characters of Star Wards. This news is related with democracy. Freedom of expression and speech is certainly the foundation of democracy. It is free that Ukraine's Internet Party runs for mayor on the topic of Star Wars. However, I think their actions are nothing but a publicity stunt aimed the election. Candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I want person who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics."
6295,I live in Japan all the time. I think that Japan is a very safe country. Therefore I think that there is not a sense of impending crisis for terrorism and the war of other countries too much. I think that all people think that they will not be generated in one's country.The economy is in a terrible condition in war. We who live in Japan cannot do the imagination. I thought that I read this news and must think about war more. I had a sense of impending crisis when I did not know when war happened in Japan.
6296,"When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement."
6297,"The environment problem is very serious in 21 century. Global worming is becoming more and more serious and the air consistence of CO2 is increasing from a long time ago, so we have to stop global worming. To stop global worming, I think it is important to develop clean energy because most of CO2 emissions comes from fossil fuel. We burn it and get gasoline, fuel oil, and also. Also we create energy from thermal power generation using fossil oil it is also discharge CO2. To use clean energy, it means we can stop to discharge these many CO2. This the most important I think. A weak point of clean energy is difficult to control volume of generate of electric but recently storage battery's technology is very progressed so we can solve this problem in near future I think. The cooperation between nations is also important. Last month COP21 was held in Paris and all over the countries made effective agreement about decreasing discharge of CO2 emissions. The point of this agreement, not only advanced countries but also developing countries have duty for decreasing CO2 emissions. From now, how decrease it from developing countries is very important for stop to global warming, also advanced countries support need for developing countries. We have to make efforts to stop global warming."
6299,"I agree with the new survey: the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. In Japan, children in upper income family can go to cram schools, then they can enter high level schools through to university. Finally, they can get jobs in major company such as banks, trading firms and insurance companies. However, children in lower income family are hard to get such opportunities. Thus, this gap is brought by bap in education. Richer people should offer financial aid for lower income families to narrow the gap in education."
6302,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is the Novel committee's fault. The committees should think over that who give it for before decide, I think too. Your opinion is very good."
6303,"When I saw this news on TV, I was glad. I have pride as Japanese. I have known existence of UNESCO heritage status and I had convinced that Japanese traditional cuisine (Washoku) had be going to get UNESCO heritage status. Because I have experience I have been to some other country and have eaten some food each country. All of them are delicious for me. Sense in other country it is first experience to eat food. But I thought maybe get try of eating that if I stay there and eat food every day. Then I was sure rustic flavor of Japan is great. I do not tried of eating even if eat every day. Then I had convinced that Japanese traditional cuisine had be going to get UNESCO heritage status."
6304,"I have recognized that Nobel Peace Prize is presenting for people who work for peace movement. This article says that Tunisia National Dialogue Quartet awarded, and I thought this prize is best. Because they work for peace without weapon but use dialogue. No blood and no sad of people. But I was surprised at this article' s last. From now, Nobel Peace Prize have nominated name of them. For example they are Hitler and Stalin. Hitler is familiar with merciless man. He killed Judea people and designated as war criminals. Stalin is Soviet dictator and he killed politics enemy. I wander that why are they nominated Nobel Peace Prize. My peace in my mind is not their works. So I studied for them works and find that. Hitler not only killed people but he was involved in the construction of the Autobahn. And it makes money for poor people because gave job to them. The view is present that Stalin had saved a lot of people at the expense of minority. So some people said that Stalin is hero. I thought factor which they nominated Nobel Peace Prize is for their good works. Nobel makes dynamite and it kills many people in some war. But he saved many people and has contributed greatly to the society. I think that Nobel Peace Prize include his mind that person to everyone failure."
6305,"When I read this article I surprised that people who work for politics is desperate. This article says the candidate is stabbed while campaigning for politics. When I asked 'please imagine life-threatening work', I imagine firefight, police-officer, security, military personnel and so on. But this time candidate is stabbed. My recognition is mistake. There are a lot of politician who killed somebody. For example Lincoln and Kennedy are. They are assassinated by somebody. It is common that they work for opportunity that life of national can be better than then. Lincoln worked hard for democracy and realized. Kennedy worked for the avoidance of Cuban Missile Crisis and save a lot of life not only American but also Cuban. Henrietta Reker worked for huge influx of asylum seekers from Syria to Germany. But she was stabbed. I know if huge asylum seekers come to in Germany, Germany economic; living environment and social security will be bad. But I know some country or somebody should save their life too. I believe her working is should be respect. It is natural and good to present many different thinking in the country. But it's not to be allowed to absolute that thinking appeal in violence. I respect her and it is reasonable to she is elected mayor."
6306,"This article is shocked for me. Because almost people dead by this accident. However as a further reason is that I am Japanese and experienced crisis from IS about Mr. Kenji Goto. It was so shocked for us. I felt familiar as I am Japanese. We swore in mind that I should not forgive the presence of IS then. But recently we might forget them. Although the Russian government has denied the association of IS, but it is big problem that we have forgotten the tragedy, and there are happen same tragedy somewhere in the world now. It can say the same thing to other things. For example Great East Japan Earthquake is big tragedy that should not be engraved on the heart. If I asked somebody 'Do you carve the scourge of simultaneous in mind?' I can't answer with confidence even though it was actually to experience. There are people who are affected and live difficult life in Tohoku. This article reminds me that. And happen in Paris and IS tragedy never happen again. So we do best for them."
6307,"I disagree with your opinion. Surely, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get better wages than before. However, I think that they cannot become the real 'rich'. Because although employee's wage get better, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Additionally, during those period the rich would get richer. Thus, poor employee cannot catch up with the rich people."
6308,"I think we shouldn't think of this news optimistically. That's because I think an election doesn't need jokes and tricks. In the case of Ukraine, A joke which a candidate in Ukraine Internet Party is Darth Vader might have a harmful influence for voters in Odessa. Why we choose a candidate in election? To realize democracy, peace and an ideal society, we listen to their speech and inquire into their election promises closely and finally are convinced that he (or she) is the best man to realize them. I'm awfully sorry that a superficial judge such as electing the candidate for the interest having nothing to do with an election (it means 'Star Wars' in this news) will affect the political situation and we shouldn't simply laugh it off. In related example, I can image that famous candidates such former athletes and entertainer tend to be elected in an Upper House election in Japan. Although all the famous candidates who are elected don't have politic ability, they are elected for their popularity and carriers. It cannot be said that this tendency of Japan is the same as this news of Ukraine unconditionally. But I want to choose a candidate by knowing their potential. And I think serious choice lead to better politics. Nowadays, Ukraine is one of the countries having political unrest. It is necessary to work hard to establish the political system of Ukraine as early as possible. So they should seriously think about Ukraine ahead of joking. We shouldn't feel that it was no concern of mine. Can we think of our country sincerely? We need to study this news."
6309,"My first impression of reading this article is funny. I like star wars and I love Chewbacca. His cute voice and act makes me laughing. But, this is the first impression. After I read this article, I thought it is not simply and funny problem. The party candidates change into the funny costume. I cannot believe it. The candidates represent his region at the meeting and they should be good models of citizens. We Japanese have nothing to do with this problem in Ukraine. However, I think we need to think it seriously. Maybe this is a big problem for Ukrainian. After a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested, he said, 'as my funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' I think this comment is so funny, but this means he slighted the official election and democracy. So, people in Ukraine should not permit him and dismiss from his job. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This act was contrary to their expectations. Now Ukraine has so many problems, but these people's act makes bad inside the country. I hope the government of Ukraine will manage the committee and the election strictly."
6310,"I agree with your opinion. In this news, I was interested in being relation to democracy. I have wondered what democracy is for many years. That's because I don't think democracy is equal to liberty. And when I read this news, I thought of my opinion again. A candidate dressed the costume 'Chewbacca' was arrested by Ukraine police and the cause of the arrest was that he was campaigning for Darth Vader. We could find Ukraine police judged even if democracy get spread of in the country, it don't mean people can express anything in public situation. Like your opinion, I also think the police's judge was good. In election, candidates should behave suitably to express their true motive without jokes. I think we should reflect on democracy."
6311,"I also have never seen the series of 'Star Wars'. So I didn't understand the relation between Chewbacca and Darth Vader. So when I read the topic sentence at first, this news is funny too. But like your opinion, I think it shouldn't be news handled as a comedy. After we know this news, we have to reflect how we misunderstand about democracy. Anyway, I am interested in your opinion' If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them….' In my opinion, there was not the sympathy about the Ukrainian repulsion to the government. I think their styles of expression are illegal in term of a public election. But after I read your opinion, I reconsidered it a little. Certainly, if they were convinced of a defeat in normal method, I can understand they struggled to won for becoming a mayor in the style. We have to think of this news with taking into consideration of Ukrainian minds not only a law."
6312,"Your opinion is so funny. Why do you watch the Star Wars? I think this is a greatest movie of all movies of science fiction. At first, I felt this article is so interesting, too. But, it is not so simply. People who were related politics should be in earnest. I think people in Ukraine dislike that the candidates make fun of citizens. So, I think your opinion is right. This must not be permitted."
6313,"I agree with your opinion. In other day, I saw the news reporting about Tunisia. When the Tunisian knew that the quartet was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, they seemed to be puzzled about the decision. And I was sorry that the one Tunisian said 'I want to immigrate to Europe but it is difficult to do it. We want not the award but water and food.' I think Tunisian democratization still is growing and never be finished. That is because the democratization makes no sense unless the citizens feel peaceable and comfortable. I think it isn't time enough to give Tunisia the Novel Peace Prize."
6314,"I agree with you. Income sometimes depends on whether we gave an enough education. Ironically, whether we can give an enough education depends on our parents' income. So, income disparity influences next generation. It needs money to give a enough education in order to be rich."
6315,"I also think the standards of the Novel Peace Prize are too abstract to be the award which Novel wished. Certainly, your opinion that we decide the range of deserving to receive the award is good. So I will take an example. I want to introduce 'The nations' approval rating' as one of the standards of the Nobel Peace Prize. After meeting the existing standards of the award, as a final judge, if the person proposed as a prize winner can receive supports of 80% of the nation, then he (she) is selected as the award winner. The reason I take this example is that I was sorry for the Tunisian case. I know when the quartet of groups from Tunisia were awarded, the citizen didn't bubble with joy of the award and think the award should be closely related to the citizen. But there are some problems to realize my example. For example, to investigate the nations' approval ratings we need to take place something such as an election. But an investigation which all the people affect cost vast money. But I think it is good idea since the nation's opinion can reflect a result."
6316,"I agree with your idea.To ban Muslim immigrations equals to racial discrimination. It is TRUE that Islamic fundamentalists happened many terrorism all over the world. Not to ban Muslim immigrations but to ban entering Islamic fundamentalists is needed now. I tried to hitting on ideas to distinguish all Muslim followers from Muslim fundamentalists who especially have dangerous thinkings.However this problem is a case about religion,so that it is hard to do these things ,The best idea that I am able to hit on is to publish certificates which are written his activities of politics. If one person has participated some dangerous political activities, police or administrative system could pay attention to him."
6317,"I think so, too. At first, I also could not understand the whole story of this article because I had never watch the movies. I didn't know Chewbacca and Star Wars characters very much, of course. It is certainly free that candidates is dressed in any clothes. The candidates of Ukraine's Internet Party would be conspicuous. But, I think they should wear proper costume and work a prompt action as representative of citizen. If they want to win the election, they should make an appeal to public sentiment for support in the proper way to express oneself. People who run for election should comply with the low, of course. I want candidates not to cause these trouble!"
6319,"When I watched this news for the first time on TV, I was very surprised.I think that using a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on stimulates their angry. Now, terrorism is very dangerous problem for all over the world. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. Therefore his speech against them is not agreed.However, there is a fact that the approval rate of him is very high.I think that people have the same argument like him.And it is important to understand Islamic estates at first. Most of people don't try to understand them, so we should think it."
6320,"I agree with your idea.It is true that Capitalism has large merits, for example everyone has chances to get money and be richer and people who make effort have high possibility to reward . But I think that this theory has not practiced.In fact, many employers use employees for a long time without break. Employers hire people low money, or do not pay their wages at the appropriate day. I often read these news in news paper . Originally, capitalism is a theory that every one has chances to get richer but in this economy there is no equality that everyone has chances . People who has educated well tend to get money and be richer. So I think we should take another look at this theory."
6322,"I agree with you. Needless to say, it goes without saying that human lives are equal regardless of age or gender. So, this question doesn't have the correct answer in my opinion. And, I take the opportunity of reading this article to want to know Chinese low system compared to Japanese. It is impossible that the government makes such an exam question in Japan because all people are equal under the low. I guess that it is not natural in China that human rights should be respected. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test."
6324,"I think that people of all over the world should think about the meaning of Nobel Prize. I searched about Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet last month. Then I read article about Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet. The contents of the article about the number of the medal. Members of Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet are 4. However Nobel Prize hands only at most 3 medals to 1 group. Therefore Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet want 4 medals to organization of Nobel Prize. When I read this article I felt a doubt. I think that meaning of Nobel Prize is different from correct purpose. I think that Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet' purpose is medals, so I felt very sad. It's opposite to carry on activity for the purpose of Nobel Prize. Nobel Prize should be given to the person who left wonderful achievements. Therefore I think that people of all over the world, especially the person who gives Nobel prize should think about purpose of Nobel Prize."
6325,"I agree with you. I thought that Nobel Prize is great prize before I read this article. However after I read this article, I thought that Nobel Prize have bad face. I want a person of all over the world to notice this fact. People should think about purpose of Nobel Prize and actuality of Nobel Prize. The influence of Nobel Prize is big, so organization of Nobel Prize should think that purpose to give, people to give and reason to give. I hope that I hope that Nobel Prize becomes a valuable prize."
6326,"I understand a little that Donald Trump focuses on America's attention on the need to secure their borders. Certainly in Paris, residents of the city are seized with fear of terrorism and seem to feel horror and anger to Muslims indiscriminately. But all Muslims don't be the radical people. If Trump passes his proposal to block all Muslims from entering the USA, then many people in the world may criticize him for a racial discrimination and I will also be in the position of criticism. Nowadays, it is certain for the mass media all over the world to watch how each country such as Japan, China, and the USA cope with Muslim. If many Muslims immigrate to Japan in the future, what will we think about it? There will be possibility to happen to a terrorism but it isn't necessarily related to religions. So we should not reject immigrants but prepare the stable and safe system of accepting them. Anyway, Trump's statement about Paris resulted in a bad influence about a relation between the USA and Europe. I hope that from experiencing the tragic terrorism in Paris, many countries will cooperate and solve this problem about terrorism."
6329,"I also think that some winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are doubtful, but I would say no to the question whether these winner should give back their prize or not. Restitution should be not allowed because it might show that the prize is not so important. The Nobel Prize, especially Peace prize must be literally 'noble' with great impact and authority. Sometimes, it was wan by person working privately (without governmental support, on the contrary, suppressed by it). It gives not only them social credit, but also the great power; cooperator from all around the world who agreed to his or her activity. For example, Malala Yousafzai. She was given the prize at her age of 17. People around the world focused on her due to the prize. We must pay attention to the meaning of the Nobel Peace Prize. Then, the problem of education for women in Pakistan became famous. On the other hand, we must not simply praise the winners. Of course, they should be looked up because at least they made some great actions which no other one could not have done, such as ended the war. But we must be skeptical to some extent. I think it is important for each ordinary people to think about the problem the winner dealt with, and have their own opinion about that. The power of public opinion is great, but fragile because it tends to influenced by wrong information from the mass media. So each person should make sure that it might not go in the wrong direction."
6331,"I have never heard about this news,so I think that Novel Peace Prize Committee should look for people who is appropriate to this prize. I think there are many people who help poor people from their tenderness,so these people are really apprised to this prize . I have just read a lot articles about Novel Peace Prize. By reading these ones , I knew some facts. The first one is that naturally Novel Peace Prize Committee reward some one who makes the best efforts to promote friendships among countries or to reduce or distinguish nuclear or to hold worldwide meeting for peace with Novel Peace Prize. Especially , only Novel Peace Prize can be given to a party and the same person or group can get this prize many times.On top of that , Novel Peace Prize can be bribed with big money. By being based in these facts , I suggest some ideas to choose Novel Peace Prize winner. The first one is that committee ask people all over the world on the Internet who is appropriate Novel Peace Prize.By using the Internet, almost every one will be able to vote this selection and person who is attending this committee will be able to know persons who has made efforts to make this world more peaceful. The second one is to change the system of this committee.As I have read above , only this committee has comprised of Swedish persons.As a result , this choice tends to be inclined to thinking of European people , so I think that this committee should be comprised of many races.By introducing many races, choice of Novel peace prize will be able to lose prejudices and get equality . As a result, people who is living in small country has chances to get Novel Peace Prize. I wrote these ways with my only opinion,but if I talk about these things with my family or friends or students who are the same ages , we will be able to hit on many better ideas to change this situation and promote this Novel Peace Prize."
6332,"I heard your presentation at my English class . By listening to your presentations , I was able to know the Novel Peace Prize system more closely . This Novel Peace Prize Committee can give medals at most 3 medals . And by understanding Tunisian National Dialogue, I can understand their purpose.I image that their purpose is not to make this world more peaceful but to be famous and to get money and fame.So I also thought that this group is not fitted Novel peace Prize. And I think that this prize should not be given easily ,so I suggest one idea to prevent getting inappropriate person. The one idea is that this prize should not give this prize every year . When appropriate person appear, this committee should search him carefully and decide whether this committee give Novel Peace Prize."
6333,"Winners of Nobel Prize have big responsibilities not only for their past but also for their future. It is the that they have done great things leaderly the world to peace but they do not do great things now. They should be the leaders of peace. For example, Obama may hope peace in his belief. However, he gives privilege to profits of the United States. He performs not as the winner of Nobel Peace Prize but as the president of the United States. I think that winners should know the importance of the role of winner."
6334,"I agree with the fact that capitalism,especially its competition makes benefits, improve our life. However,in the matter of environment, capitalism does not go well. If each country progress,the environment becomes worse. All countries and peoples want to get better life. So, we should think the meaning of 'progress ' and 'development ' again. We should not want materialistic development. We should hope the progress of QOL, peace of mind and environment. Change the direct of target in this capitalistic world."
6336,"Trump said that the government should ban the Muslim immigration to the U.S. entirely.This statement was based on the effect of incident in California, but one of the reason he said was his ideology that most of Muslim have a complex about the U.S. Surely, Iraq War and 9.11 made Muslim anti-America, a lot of people hate them. I consent his idea that banning all Muslim immigration is rational. However, of course, there are minority. Muslim who work in the U.S. ordinary, who like culture of America. We should think about these people. And also, it said in the video which attached on the News based English page, the U.S. was made by immigrants from UK. It called as 'Land of Liberty'. Today, it become a society like salad bowl where the Hispanic, African, and Asian live. In addition, in the statement by trump, the government should regulate Muslim because they commit a terrorism by the reason of holy war. Indeed, extremists do the destruct and suicide bombing by the reason of it. However, it was wrong that all Muslim have the same ideology. The grounds of his idea tend to regard remarkable action as whole action. Regulate all for the perfect peace. Surely, It is more safety by regulate all Muslim immigration. However, we must think maximize benefit of a lot of people including minority."
6338,"As mentioned above, it seems they sometimes give the Nobel Peace Prize to those who do not deserve it, which makes us discuss over the question whether the winners should give theirs back or not, and I think they do not have to. We should not regard the authority of the prize as cheap, petty one, and should respect the winners without discussion. Some people might think it ironical or even wrong, but I must say, if we want to enjoy our daily peaceful lives at ease, such attitude is indispensable to indirectly justify the peace as presented. Now I give further consideration about this point from a different kind of view. Let's start thinking about heroes and our need for them to worship. There is the limited aspect in which they are great, or greatly contributed to realizing peace, and there is the other one in which they are ordinary human beings like the rest of us. No great man lives constantly on the level of his vision, or on what we think he a great man spends his life. Our want for them to look up to however, generally makes us disregard or even deny what is in a man with a great achievement, and that is what I think sometimes make people be disappointed at them. So, somebody may say we should stop respecting such heroes without discussion and depart with dogmatic belief like that. But is it really possible for us to live completely apart from it? Can we remove every dogmatic belief from our lives? Ultimately, as you may think, we simply can't. Under no circumstances will dogmatic belief cease to exist, or, in other words, people will never cease to entertain some opinions on trust and, say, without discussion. Think what would happen if everybody undertook to form all his own opinions and to seek for truth (like investigating the Nobel Prize winner is worth the prize or not) by isolated paths struck out by himself alone. It would follow that no considerable number of men would ever unite in any common belief, which leads to the situation where nobody that greatly contributed to universal aspiration like peace would be publicly praised. Moreover, without such common belief no society or international consent would exist or be formed, say, rather, no general peace would do; for without ideas held in common there is no common action, for instance, deciding like what action is acceptable for peaceful world, and without common action there may still be humans, but there is no social body, which means no policing force exists to maintain public rules. (Let me put aside the world's policeman' here. ) In order that peaceful society should exist and prosper, it is necessary that the minds of all the citizens should be rallied and held together by certain prevalent ideas, and this cannot be the case unless each of them sometimes draws his opinions from the common source already formed and consents to accept certain matters of belief also already existed. In conclusion, from a shortness of your life, you do not have the time, nor, from the limits of your intelligence, the ability, to act in this way, you are reduced to taking on trust a lot of facts and opinions which you have not had either the time or the power to verify for yourself, but which people of great capacity have found out, or which the crowd adopts, and on this foundation you raises for yourself the structure of your own thoughts. And now I have to, or, rather, want to say, no other than this process will finally satisfy the real and vital purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize, and all the prizes already given are given to 'appropriate' people."
6340,"This news was very strange for me. When I read this article for the first time, I could not realize the contents because I did not know about Star Wars so much. I thought what Chewbacca and Wookiee were. The reason why he did not pay a small fine was unique. He really kept the world view of Star Wars. But, Ukraine's Internet Party seems to fool around. I do not believe that those people were elected. Such a matter will not occur in Japan. If things go on like this, the confusion in Ukraine will continue. Ukrainian should elect proper politicians if they really want to solve national problem. And regional issues are very complicated to solve. Ukraine where is located between Europe and Russia is in a delicate position."
6341,"If I were an American, I would somewhat agree with Donald J. Trump's 'outrageous' proposal to block all Muslims from entering the United States. Ruthless terrorism by ISIS irrationally kills a great number of innocent citizens in many cities, and its threat is coming closer to the United States from day to day, and thus the need for taking some severe countermeasures against upcoming atrocity is appealed everywhere in the country. In such a terrible, special, and emergent situation, though there are many non-ISIS Muslims in need of shelter from ISIS, who can assert his proposal is just self-defeating? According to the article, Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter, 'hate is not an American value'. So, can you describe the proposal as only by the idea of hate…? That can't be! I know many American wants to defend themselves as far as possible, but the general public wants the government to guarantee it takes any measures to protect its people from life-threatening matters, isn't it?As referred above, Mr. Trump is partly applauded by some conservative people, who say he reflected the electorate's real views more honestly than the party's leaders. When I read this, I said to myself, 'As well they may, after all the danger the United States is facing.' Even if his a bit too strict proposal will be turned down, I think they should abolish the 'visa lottery system', which Rick Santorum said allows many radicals get into the United States, at least. As most people say, I admit that what he says about this problem is always a little too extreme, and some of his remarks are utterly groundless, but it is also a fact that the situation these days where a spate of terrorism by ISIS menaces lives of the people all over the world makes us be sensitive to Muslim to the highest degree."
6342,"You have good reason to think so, and I also think of his strong attitude toward this problem as one of his strategy to win the upcoming election. But, at the same time, I can support what he says to some degree, regardless of his greatly possible hidden aim. The United States should secure its borders carefully so as to protect its people."
6343,"I totally agree with you.Candidates like them might make light of their conducts' impact on the democratic society.The democracy where such fools that thinks nothing of their people thrive can only decay, not properly function.I suggest Ukrainian government punish the criminal candidates severely."
6344,"As you pointed out, 'powerful' people like Bill Gates should express their thoughts about environmental problems.They will have a greater impact on many people around the world than ordinary people like us will do.Campaigns like such should be held more to solve environmental problems."
6345,"When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, it is very wrong to compare the value of his girlfriend's life with that of his mother's one in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. According to the people in the article, ''the law was unjust or 'ridiculous', especially in emergency situations where many lives may be at stake.'' ''People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law.'' ''I have no idea why giving up your mum is a crime, while giving up your girlfriend is not.'' I think also that it is not possible to compare the life of the lover with that of the mother, so even if a person cannot save either life in the emergency situation, the person should not be judged or other people cannot judge the person because nobody is bad. I think that the argument was caused by the difference in the each person's recognition to the equality right. So I would like to give some examples of other countries' constitutions which prescribe what the equality right is. The first example is Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. In the Basic Law, the universal content that all people are equal under the law is defined, and it shall not be possible for every person to suffer a disadvantage and to get the preferential treatment because of sex, family origin, race, language, homeland, origin and religious or political views. In addition, the equality of men and women have been clearly specified in the Basic Law. The second example is Brazil Constitution. In the constitution, it is said that all of the people are equal before the law without any kind of discrimination, and it is guaranteed inviolable rights to life, freedom, equality, safety and property rights under the following provisions for Brazilians and foreigners to emigrate to the country. 1. In accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, men and women are equal in rights and obligations.... The final example is the United States Constitution. In the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the content about the right of equality is written. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Since I mentioned some of the constitutional items regarding equality of other countries as above, next, I would like to pick up an item about the equality of the Japanese Constitution. According to the provisions of the Constitution of Japan, 1. All of the people is an equality under the law, race, creed, gender, by social status or family origin, in political, economic or social relations, not discrimination. 2. Peers and peerage shall not be recognized. 3. honor, awarded the Medal other honors is not accompanied by any privilege. Award of honor is, actually has this, or only one generation of the future which is person who receives, has its effect. This section is intended to define the so-called equality under the law (which is one equal rights for five rights). Respect for fundamental human rights coupled with, and is intended to constitute one of the principles of the Constitution, respect for basic human rights is, whereas the meaning inherently guarantee of rights possessed by each person, and under the law equality is to intended to ensure the sufficient rights even in comparison with others. This section as the 'family origin', as referred to in paragraph 1, it is considered to mean the pedigree or pedigree. Lords after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, such as the do not allow the presence of hereditary aristocracy, such as nobility was born to mother aristocrats. While not denying that you awarded the honor of honors, etc., this is it is assumed that it finds as long as that does not result in a privileged position or hereditary position. By the Emperor and imperial presence of an exception provision is constitutional Chapter 1 of expressly for this section, be outside the scope. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code, but the Emperor of-laws also exist,-laws of the Emperor is not hit in the aristocracy. It should be noted that, on the relationship that prohibits discrimination based on family origin, to be established according to the 'family origin' as 'a son of a politician' and 'candidacy restrictions to public office politicians' in the law 'prohibits discrimination based on family origin' as a violation of the Constitution has been, it is also the provisions of which are incorporated naysayer to hereditary politicians regulation. In the enactment process of the Constitution of Japan, Emperor Showa for the abolition of the nobility, it is said to have been pointed out that 'Dojo nobility or can not (aristocrats born of nobility) only to leave', sufficient consideration of such a proposal has not been made ing. In fact, at the stage of the GHQ draft and constitutional amendment draft outline as it is in the history of the following between the nobility one generation of his lifetime has become a form that allows the Eishaku, and Kijūrō Shidehara which was also the own Baron also strong in this clause Good but it showed [1], (one of the Ashida modified) Modify passed immediately discontinued in the House of Representatives has passed this on draft street which has been passed by the House of Lords is also the House of Representatives. Law applied equality theory the meaning of 'equality under the law', there is a concept of law contents equality theory (legislator restraint theory), the meaning of equality there is a theory that theory that an absolute equality, the relative equality . In addition, 'race, creed, sex, social status or family origin' limited enumeration and capture theory, there is a theory that in an illustrative enumeration. The Supreme Court, as long as it is not intended to be based on reasonable grounds in accordance with this provision on the nature of things, have construed the provisions of the intention to ban the legal discriminatory treatment. However, in Japan, there was an incident on the law that became unconstitutional by the weight difference between life, although the incident was a murder case. The case was in 1968, 29-year-old woman at that time killed the father at the time 53-year-old who had forced to incest against itself in Tochigi Prefecture Yaita. It is referred to as 'Tochigi father killing incident,' 'Tochigi father murder'. Next, I describes the Chinese Constitution that came to make this test. It has established for equality rights, and any citizens are all equal before the law (Article 33), 18 years of age or older citizens, ethnic, racial, gender, occupation, specifically that it is not discrimination by the difference of the property, etc. set. In particular, the provision of the own protection provisions against ethnic minorities and women in China has been suppressed for a long period of time. However, even though it has already been defined for equality by this Constitution, in China there is inequality between ethnic groups. The problem is Tibet problem. Disputes Tibetans with the culture of church and state match has occurred for independence and a high degree of autonomy from China. Recently have international issues as a human rights issue but the suppression of religion, freedom of the Tibetan people by the Chinese authorities. Tibet became of China in the late 18th century Hunt, Qing but has a suzerainty internal affairs was remained in a state of hold the Dalai Lama Government Office. Despite to have established in the Constitution for equality, China is a vague sense of equality because there is inequality between ethnic groups. There is another point that I could not be satisfied. I think that it is very wrong that no one on the Chinese internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. The test clearly assumes the test takers are male. I think that this is an obvious gender discrimination that is happening in China. I feel that it is regrettable that this kind of men and women discriminatory test problem appears in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. In conclusion, by picking up the items on equality of Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and Brazilian Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Japanese Constitution and Chinese constitution, I considered what is the equality. Then, I think that the exam question in National Judicial Exam is Inappropriate in terms of the equality of people's lives and gender discrimination."
6346,"I could not also believe it was an actual problem. As you said, the news related to Star Wars is very timely. Actually this news was spread on SNS. Maybe it became a good publicity for the latest work. But the man in Chewbacca should not do such a act. Moreover, he should properly pay the fine."
6348,"I was surprised at two points when I read this article at first. First, I was surprised at the fact about capitalism. Bill Gates says that private sectors or individual can't solve energy problems, so big rich companies like his should deal with the problems. To be frank, I was a bid sad to be said such a thing. I believed that the criminal person who makes danger climate change was everybody in the world, so everybody was responsible to solve the problem and had to cooperate. Certainly, it may cost much money to reduce CO2 emissions and find new energy source and we can't create such a great deal of money. However, no matter what anyone says, I want to join to the approach and play a part as a member of the world. Second, I got a scare to China's green investment. I had known the fact that the deal of China CO2 emission is the most in the world, but I not known about China's act. Japanese including me often say that China pollutes our Asia and world irresponsibility because we don't know China's solar project well. I think Japanese should reflect on their past conduct and follow China's investment as the developed country."
6349,"I am opposed to your idea. They cannot certainly save both their mother and girlfriend under this dangerous situation. There is something in what you say. But, it is very important for lawyers to treat equally people's lives and right. They need to make a right decision according to each situation. So, I think this question is not proper as the national test of choosing the lawyers."
6350,"I was surprised to read this article because I have ever heard this question,'Which of your girlfriend or mother do you save from a deadly fire? ', but I couldn't believe the official organization made this question in the official test. I think to make this question isn't correct. People may have their own opinions and answers as a lot of people discussed online. I think each person has he or her answers, for example 'I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own,' and 'People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law.' However the official organization's deciding the correct answer is not virtuous. It is true that in China, there are teachings that you should make much of your parents, but that is no reason for the official organization's putting special emphasis on parents. Anyone has freedom of thought, so the official organization's controlling their minds by deciding the correct answer is illegal. If I am Chinese, I don't want people that passed the test as this article to become judicial officers."
6351,"Surely, at first, this premise that examinees are male is wrong, but Chinese posture that mother is prior to girlfriend is proper. Because,parents are regarded as important from the old in China. Of course, all people should be equal, but Chinese society is based on this system. I think it's good to keep this posture in the future."
6352,"I don't agree with you. Actually, the world is not peaceful now, however, that is no reason for nobody's making efforts. The Novel Peace Prize's reason for being is blamed, but I think it plays very important role. It is true that people who won it don't contribute the world peace completely, but their achievements shouldn't a little influence other people. If there isn't the Novel Peace Prize, people may not have interests in the world peace. I think it is a symbol of peace, so it is necessary for people to continue to think about peace seriously. For example, Malala Yousafzai won it in 2014. She demand that all girls can receive the education. She was shot in the head by a group of armament in 2012, but she never gave in to this happening, she continued her activity. Of course, she was famous before she won the Novel Peace Prize, but the news that announced her prize-giving made her the man of the hour. What do people think about by hearing this news? When I knew it, I had respect for her and thought about the world peace deeply. As this example, the Novel Peace Prize and prize winners gave us the opportunity to think about peace seriously. You said 'the Nobel Peace Prize are becoming a mere name. At first, some current winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are not suitable. I doubt this way of thinking because the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with accomplished peace. All in all, I strongly believe that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace.', but I don't think so considering the circumstances mentioned above. Nobody is perfect, so people who won the Novel Peace Prize isn't perfect too. If they don't contribute the world peace completely, I think they are suitable for giving it, because they give us the chance to meditate the world peace."
6353,"Hi! I found some point that I agree and not agree. ' I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch.' - I agree with this opinion too. As an issue that we are familiar with, many super market introduce 'ECO point'. In this system, you can get some point when you use ECO bag. This system have something in common with a substantial carbon tax. I think this is good for incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. ' Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market.' - I agree with your thinking about capitalism, but I cannot agree with' the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism'. As wages are being raised in developing countries these days, developed countries can find new larger market abroad. For example, Japanese companies of communications business aim at expansion for South America to establish a communications infrastructure in developing country. Thus, capitalism enters a new phase, and is growing now. ' I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared.' - I cannot agree with it. I think that Japan is still a society where educational record counts for a lot. Certainly, we can receive a scholarship, but there is a large difference between the people who is rich and enters a top-flight company and who is poor and is blue color worker for a life time. ' I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. ' - I agree with your opinion so much. I think that young people including us must think about this problem seriously. We should make positive efforts to participate in politics."
6354,"I was surprised at his plan to block all Muslims from entering the United States. I certainly feel afraid whenever I watch the news of a terrible terrorism. Not only Japan but every country should stand up to terrorism, especially Islamic estates. But, we must keep in mind that all Muslim are not radicals. I suppose such proposal is inconsistent the separation of church and state. And, this plan may lead to causing new acts of terrorism or religious conflicts. Religious problems are very complicated and sensitive. The U.S. government should find another way to prevent terrorism."
6355,"I agree with your idea. The time when we concentrate on materialistic progress has ended. Now we have enough food and live in our homes safely and welfare is set minutely,so we should think about the quality of rights and equality. It is said that our country is peace and order ,but we have a lot of problems about order, for example , aging society has progressed rapidly and institutions that the old come in are in short . As a result, the young who works at these institutions resorts to violence.Can we say the world which the young wounded the old peaceful? The answer is No. I think that this situation should change into both of generations cooperate with to solve problems that this world stands . This thinking also applies to the problem of environment. The developed countries for example USA ,Australia,and Japan and so on has developed enough and has high technology.So if they decide not to use coals or heat power plant , we can make electricity by using another ways.On the other hand, developing countries for example India ,South America , and so on do not have enough technology and money .If they decide not to use plants or machines that emit carbon dioxide, they will not make enough electricity to move factry.As I have stated above,developing countries are different from developed countries in money and technology. So we should pay attention to these differences thinking about environmental problems."
6356,"I strongly disagree with your opinion.How can you say the more Chinese Japanese companies hire in their factories in China, the richer they become?Is the increase in the number of labor working there directly make their wage raised?I don't think so.Even if they get higher wage thanks to invested capital, we cannot overestimate the effect to be so great that China would drive Japanese factories out.The relationship between China and Japan describes as labor and capital will never change in that way.The chances are that Chinese corporations make good use of advanced technology imported from Japan to China, and benefit more efficiently.But I don't think the effect like you pointed out in your comment would happen.So I don't think the capitalism today will function in the way you mentioned."
6357,"I agree with your opinion on some points. ' human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law.' - I agree with your opinion. All people must be treated regardless of sex, religion,race etc.... . This is an essential factor of modern society. This human right is a constitutional right. ' I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend.' - I agree with this part of your opinion too. The proverb says,' Children do not realize how much their parents love them.' , I think so. My parents love me more than any other people in the world, so I want to repay an obligation by rescuing them. ' What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan.' - I agree. When I heard this story about old Japanese law in another class, I was very surprised.I cannot believed such a law.That is unconstitutional clearly. Even if there is a strong effect of Confucian philosophy in China, I hope that Chinese way of thinking about human rights is changed. 'anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally.' - I agree. I think that more and more kinds of people should be a legal occupation, because they have to aid many kinds of the weak (the economically disadvantaged people, the physically handicapped people etc...). Thus, they have to have a right understanding of them. ' A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind.' - I agree. Though this test was checked by many many people, this question was not withdrawn. I cannot believe this. I want to be a lawyer in the future, but I am anxious about a male society."
6358,"This article is too difficult for me to understand. But after I read this article, I have two thoughts of my own. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion. I think that we have reached the limit of growth in capitalism. That system is an economy system. Capitalism is the economic policy that established an important point in that people can make money by anyone by power of money and the resource freewheelingly without being disturbed in violence and social position. In other words, it is that capitalist and a person from company own a means of production and are the economic system which they let a worker work for their profit pursuit and produce. But these days, wages are tend to raising in developing countries. Then products will not be able to compete on the market all over the world. So, I think that almost innovators and energy buyers can't afford to turn a energy source that is using now to a new one because of climate change. Secondly, I think that the economic disparity opens and also think that 'the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer'. These days, Japan is gap-widening society. In addition, the difference is spreading and immobilizing. A parent is a person of upper class, their child tends to be a adult of upper class, and a parent is a person of down class, their child tends to be a adult of down class. If a parent is wealthy class, it is possible to employ a tutor and let their child go to the private supplementary school. And the child masters good results at school and advances to the first-class university and finds a job in the first-class company and earns money, and become wealthy class. If a parent is the poor, it is impossible to let their child go to school, especially a private school. Of course they cannot absolutely let their child go to the private supplementary school and employ a tutor. Then the child will fall into an education shortage, and will not be able to find a job in the good company, and become the poor. The true problems of the gap-widening society are immobilization of the income gap and immobilization of the hierarchies of a high income earner and the low-income person. The society that can support to the person who wants to find a job is an ideal. It is thought that there is room for the examination as for the system that the person who can make an effort can acquire higher qualifications in a shorter term. I think the society which supports the person who has motivation and makes an effort, even if the number of age is how many, even if trouble visits is ideal. But now, Japan is gap-widening society. So, I think that the government should cooperate with the company and the local, and support the person who does the best. For example, in elementary school and junior high school, small class should be realized. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. In that way, regardless of a domestic income level, opportunity that receive high quality education will be expanded. For the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared."
6359,I can not understand why they decide order. And I can not understand the criteria of this judgement.
6360,"This is so an interesting topic for us, the students of law faculty. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam heated arguments on online, for it is a little too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person. The Japanese constitution article 14 says 'all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.' This is true even for the people who are in close relationship to us. So we cannot answer the question in the respect of jurisprudence. The question is asked in the examination to be the expert of it. In addition, the test was held by the state. Therefore, it is inevitable for it to be criticized by many people. But, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficult problem they will faced with in the future. The students taking the exam were people who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very, very difficult to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make a fair one everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), I think it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job."
6362,"At first, I was surprised and I thought its test was very very terrible. Because I think that people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. If we choose to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. In the same situation, I think I will rescue my mother because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. But it is the story in emergency and I think the boyfriend should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing his girlfriend. In Japan there was a law about killing one's parent, but it is thought that is not permitted for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I wish to improve the Chinese way of thinking about human will change like Japan."
6363,"I agree with you. I think a candidate who is identified a character shouldn't be elected to the city council. Everybody have right to statement freely, so democracy in itself isn't incorrect to protect their right. However, everything isn't allowed to do. If they hope to realize their thought, they should win the confidence. I think people tend to trust a person who always looks neat and tidy, so the candidate should have put on not costume of a character but suit, polo shirt, and so on. When I read this article in the class, I wasn't able to understand the content well, because in Japan, this activity rarely happens. However, I should understand it deeply, because the globalization is making steady progress, so it is necessary for me to comprehension the international situation in order to live through the present day."
6364,"Your idea is about the same as mine. However, your proposal to prevent terrorism, that is to check carefully many people by many policemen and to set watching cameras in many places, differs from mines. This way can invade our privacy more than necessity. If we aim at the liberty, we have to consider the right to privacy. By the way, my proposal to prevent terrorism is to get rid of the terrorist and to protect a minority. This two methods are indivisible."
6365,"I think that I should not add a difference to life. Thanks to mother who gave birth to oneself, the love are great and are surely changed into nothing other. It is about normal exceedingly that I can think in this way. However, as for being one life even if it is life of mother, and being the life that received life again in the world, a girl friend is the same. She has mother and is born in the same way as all. Even if it is mother, life does not have the difference and thinks that you should not attach it. In addition, I think the examination in quest of such a problem to review it."
6366,"I was very surprised when I first knew about Donald Trump and his proposal. His proposal was unrealistic in present America, since I had an image of America as a typical multi-ethnic nation. So I thought he would be criticized by a majority of American people. But the fact seemed different from what I expectation. According to the reports, his approval rating was the top in the Republican Party. I could not believe that! Of course, there are conservative people in the U.S., but his proposal is too extreme. It is not surprising that those who perform an act of terrorism are only a small part of Muslim. Even if his policy is carried, settlement of the problems would be difficult. What he said is violent language. He is not appropriate for the president. He is only racist. I wonder his remarks unnecessarily stir up anti-Muslim feelings. It is true that protecting the nation from terrorism is important. It is an age when many countries and regions are attached by IS. Especially, IS is hostile to the U.S. American government must take some measures against the terrorism. However, he hurt a lot of Muslim who were far from terrorism. He is calling to block all Muslims from entering the United States. The mayor of London, Boris Johnson said that Mr. Trump's claim about his city was complete and utter nonsense and he added: 'The only reason I wouldn't go to some parts of New York is the real risk of meeting Donald Trump.' His response was very nice. I do not want him to be elected to the Presidency. I think that a little more neutral person should serve the president."
6367,"I am against this article. This is because it thinks that it is not avoided the person that the Nobel Prize has contributed to war being given it. A person participating in war and a dispute, the person who, besides, produce weapons exist innumerably. There is no drill if I mind it one by one. With that in mind, I think that you should examine how long you contributed to the world. I think that I am given the Nobel Prize to a person playing an active part in various fields fairly by doing it this way."
6369,"I sympathize with this article. The election is fair and is not surely the place that may joke. What I disguise myself as is outrageous. However, I think that it is a good thought to let interest in election of modern people unlike election leave that disguise as the character of the popular movie. advances in the present age, and the politician in the world adopts the opinion of the elderly person than the opinion of a youth carrying the coming future. This is because an elderly person sends big interest to election. It will let the interest of many people leave for the election to do the disguise of the character of a movie attracting support from a wide generation. The youth may go to the election more by doing it this way. Furthermore, the politician may raise the innovative thought that thought about future in the future to get the support of the youth by doing so it. This original strange thought can have possibilities to change the future of the country."
6370,I do not agree with you. It is true that terrorism by ISIS kills a great number of innocent people and many countries are feeling threatened by the terrorism. But this is true of Muslim as well. Besides blocking all Muslims from entering the United States is not so efficient because there is likelihood of terrorism by someone living in the U.S.
6371,"I agree with your opinion. As you say, the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics and the economic disparity opens. If parents have a lot of money, they can let their child go to the private supplementary school and let he or she go to the private school. Conversely, if parents are poor, they cannot let their child receive education enough. I think that we must cut off this negative chain of disparity. There are two points that I consider it as the method that I solve this problem. First, regardless of a domestic income level, for expanding opportunity that any children receive high quality education the small class should be realized in elementary school and junior high school. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. Secondly, for the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the problem will be solved and the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared."
6372,"When I heard this news, I felt that this article was funny and interesting by only photograph of a strange animal. But I could not understand this article's contents at first, because I did not know what was the Chewbacca and star wars in detail. After that I was told by my group mate about star wars and what was the Chewbacca, I could understand this news' contents easily and I thought it is not simply and funny problem. And I was very surprised, because I have never seen such an accident in Japan, so someone may think he was very unique first, but I think that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election and we should think how not to happen such a terrible accident any more.And candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I wish people who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics."
6373,"I was also surprised to hear this news. His statement is too eccentric idea. It seems that Mr. Trump thinks all Muslim have dangerous ideology. However, it is not true. Some countries are bombing to IS controlled regions. Japanese government also support this bombing. But, we should not forget innocent Muslim people are killed or injured and IS would have doubled their anger against those countries. The more they repeat bombing, the bigger IS strengthen their anger. Also, the more they repeat bombing, the more number of refugees increase. Then, the problem of refugee would get complicated and EU countries would get more worried. Bombing will never lead to solution of IS and refugees. Therefore, we should find another way to prevent terrorism."
6374,"I am agreeable for this article. Capitalism supports modern society, and it is certain that I contributed to development. In addition, I may not deny that a developed country and a big company sweep over the world using technology and economic power. Depending on capitalism, it is modern times, the present age in this way that I progressed. However, it is modern times, the present age that I get rid of an underdeveloped country and a worker while it progresses like that. Besides, I sacrificed it to existing various things on the earth. Nature, human relations, every thing including the fuel are lost. As for the damage to give naturally so that it is touched by an article, awful. Agreements such as the carbon footprint business are concluded, and discharge is limited, and a sign of the improvement appears. However, human relations show adverse effects of the capitalism. The connection of a person and the person was abundant and valued the connection before. The human being exists as an individual, and the connection is thin now. It may be said that this is the worst event that capitalism brought. There may be us at a good opportunity to review capitalism."
6375,"I agree with your opinion. I also think this question has serious problem and is ridiculous. If I were in this situation, will confuse which should I help. As you say, I also think that we should not compare the human life, because people's lives should be treated equally. But I think that is difficult. I don't think that life itself includes equality, inequity. I think that social handlings include inequity. For a viewpoint closely social as for it for life itself. When a person dies, everybody holds a funeral. By influence during the lifetime, it is different in a scale and contents. I think that the sense of the dignity for the life is the same. I think that after all, the life is not a thing that is not to be able to guess in equality or inequity. It can be only said that all life has a meaning. So, I can not understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it."
6376,"An emigrant policy has the following intentions. The government was in the full-scale examination of the mass acceptance of the emigrant as a stopgap plan of the labor force to decrease sharply with low birthrate and aging. 2 that average number of births per woman can maintain population at because Cabinet Office accepts 200,000 people every year. I calculate it as a test if it recovers to 07 when wide cloth decrease of the population is avoided for the next 100 years. It is (omission), but influence on employment and culture friction, concern to peace and order aggravation resist an emigrant policy. Besides, the foreign worker limits it to talented people with high specialty and technique now, but it is difficult only in altitude talented people if I will accept 200,000 people every year. Need to found the door comes out to simple labor. Called '(culture friction, peace and order concern) to lay friction with the Japanese society the' (employment concern) pressed the Japanese employment by an emigrant' community and religious difference that an emigrant makes' so that there is what is good, and is concerned about as a big problem when accept an emigrant for the article mentioned above think that is big and is divided into two. It is many social problems and uneasiness caused by such an emigrant, but these are not true shade of the emigrant policy. For example, I am accepted widely by the local society, and the Japanese-emigrant who emigrated in Central and South America often succeeds socially now (the example that Peruvian President Fujimori and the top of the Brazilian air force are Japanese-people). Furthermore, the countries of England and France German North Europe which was a side accepting an emigrant must control that oneself was the greatest emigrant discharge country once now. This is because it is the current United States that each European country particularly Germany, Ireland, England, Italy, Netherlands, emigrant of a country, the area such as Sweden flow in large quantities, and was established. You must note that none of the emigrants is reason to become the social problem in countries of the emigration. Most that formed a rising nation, American work force of the 19th century were relatively supported in such a 'Europe' by a low German emigrant of the income, an Irishman emigrant. An emigrant generally has a low income level, and the operation environment has many inferior cases again. Meanwhile, it is that the birth rate projects in a meaning called sexual intercourse as the only entertainment or the board to feed a parent in the future, and one becoming higher applies to emigrants of the world not only France. What kind of thing will this mean? Briefly, I mean that I say that the population of the emigrant increases at an increasing tempo when the emigrant first generation repeats two generations, third generation in the country of the emigration though it was minority. In other words the second generation of 200,000 emigrants, the third generation mean that they let you enlarge the population more every year when they apply it to a former article. It is the United States where (Hispanic) emigrant (including the illegality) population of Mexico increases rapidly mainly, but, according to a certain test calculation, the United States is expected now in 2050 by Hispanic increase when it is in the world of the nonwhite. The United States may become the country of the Hispanic 100 years later if I say more. The reason is because the birth rate that is Hispanic than a native American white is predominantly high namely. there are many problems with emigration in this way."
6377,"I agree with your opinion. And I also could not understand the whole story of this article. When I was a child, I have watched only Star Wars episode 1, but I forgot the character and the story. I think that joke candidate should not be elected and punished seriously because candidates should wear proper clothes for occasion and have responsibility to campaign for the election."
6380,"At first, when I read this article, I was surprised. I disagree with Trump's plan. We must not discriminate people. All Muslim is not dangerous. By banning Muslim immigration, some of children and women were died. I think we should receive Muslim immigration."
6381,"I am for your opinion. I think people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion , too."
6382,"I do not agree with you. Nobel Peace Prize is only prize, so this prize is not super magic thing. We have to deal with actual peace problems little by little."
6384,"I disagree with your opinion. Certainly, in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. But we can not supplement by it, so the poor get poorer and the rich get richer."
6386,"I am opposed to Trump's plan that bans Muslims immigrations. At first, as a candidate, his statement was so thoughtless. It is true that people are afraid of terrorism all over the world, but blocking all Muslims from entering the United States can't be a drastic measure and can't stops terrorism. Secondly, Muslims are not always those who bring about terrorism. So Trump's idea should not be carried out, I think."
6387,"I can't agree with your opinion that Trump's proposal isn't just self-defeating, though there are many non-ISIS Muslims, because such an idea can lead to a racial discrimination. So his statement spoiled the Republican Party's strategy that tries to win the support of Jewish persons, who are cautious of a racial discrimination."
6388,"I agree with you. I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics too. Your statement that today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds aroused sympathy from me. In my opinion, the family finances influence children's academic background directly. If parents have much money, they could put their money into children's future by getting children taking private lessons and acquiring culture. As a result, children have much education. The following is illustrate what I think. Almost students of university of Keio have high adjusted deviation score. Everyone can't enter university of Keio. Students made efforts to enter it. I think the thing that supported them most is their parents. Of course, their parents cheered up them and made delicious dish for them. However, it was sure that the family finances contributed to their high adjusted deviation score most. Therefore, students maybe grew up in rich family. On the contrary, it isn't easy for children who grew up in poor family to enjoy high-quality education because they couldn't have the chance that they could learn something except school, for example cram school and swimming school. If you were born in rich family, it is easy for you to enjoy high-quality education. However, if you were born in poor family, it isn't easy for you to receive it. This circle is comfortable for rich people, but for poor people, it is just vicious circle. Unless the government stems this circle, rich people may get richer and poor people get poorer. I think the most important point in case of pursuing policies against this circle is whether poor people enjoy the blessings of them. It is no use that only rich people really feel the blessings of them. Actually, it takes a lot of times to get to benefaction to poor people, but if the government think about the future of the people and country seriously, I think it is valuable to invest a lot of times and money. I hope every child could enjoy high-quality education and my country become more affluent."
6390,"This article said that it seems they sometimes give the Nobel Peace Prize to those who do not deserve it. Also there are sentence 'It's clear Nobel wanted the prize to go to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement.' in this news. I agree with this idea. The Novel peace prize should give the people who fight for peace and freedom without using violence or not cause dead people. So, in that point of view , Obama and Henry Kissinger did not deserve the Novel peace prize."
6391,"I agree with your opinion. First, I have never seen 'Star Wars 'series. So I can not understand this news in detail. But those movies are very famous so I read this article, I want to watch 'Star Wars 'before. And I am interested in this news and movie. Second this country, Ukrainian is funny country. But such problem is serious . Not only funny but also serious . But I think that they enjoy doing such things, because he didn't pay a fine by the reason of stupid. If they want to win the election , he (or they ) should admits himself. Certainly, if the political party is comics or movies characters , I am interested in this political party. But if the political party does not what they should do, I may be losing the interest and think that do not playfully."
6392,"At first sight, I was very surprised at the article for its strangeness. (Few days ago, the STAR WARS movie was released, and this news will attracts the world's attention again.) And many other people might also be thought it unique and as a kind of joke. And the news of the statue which was transformed into the Darth Vader is also very surprising and strange. But these joking candidates are not so bad, because due to them, people around the world started to focus on the political matter of Ukraine. Though this situation might become temporary, this is true that these joking candidates led to the improvement of social awareness. Of course, they are not appropriate for public election. But everyone knows the ordinary fact and will not elect them for real. So they do not harm seriously to the election, I think. At least, only in the respect of social awareness, (and apart from the reality,) they may not be simply suppressed."
6393,"I saw this news at first,I was surprised by picture . Also I could not understand that 'Chewbacca arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules' and what Chewbacca is because I did not see the Star Wars. But when I went on reading this news , gradually I understood this article. I think that this is very serious. We have to think about how we should do election . In Japan :"
6394,"This idea which is the disguising themselves as characters of the movie is unique and so interesting, because I think that this idea is able to give a impact to many people. I also got a strong impact when I saw their appearance on TV news, and I think that is good idea, because they can get attention easily. In addition, people might be feel strong affinities easily with them. However, Chewbacca should not make an excuse because of the setting of the movie if he breaks the law. I thought this behavior is a conduct that a candidate of the election should not engage in and he accepts defeat with a bad grace. In that case, he can give an only bad impression to people. This political party has to turn over a new leaf if it wants to improve the impression of the citizens."
6395,"When I read this news first time ,I was very surprised . This news point is that the story of a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, saying his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. I think that this is ridiculous and unbelievable. The life of individual people is equal and we cannot judge which life : mother or girlfriend is more important. There are sentence of 'China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option four days after the exam, saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones' in this news. But not every people were brought up carefully by own parent. So, I do not agree with this sentence."
6396,"I can't support Trump's proposal. Surely, to prevent terrorist from terrorism is very important issue and it is necessary for United States to do such policy. When I was a junior high school and high school student,I used to go school that believe in a religion for six years. Then I took a lesson about various religious faith . So I learned Islam including Muslims. People who believe in Islam are not berserk. Ordinary Muslims are not strong bindings and exclusive. Nevertheless, all Muslims are forbidden entrance into a country is powerful regulation. He did his best for their country. His selection is reasonable. But people who believe in Islam have liberty that they can enter a country. I think that maybe there are another measures that can achieve the same propose . Besides this measure is laxer than proposal that Trump insisted. But Tramp's supporter stood by this proposal enthusiastically. On the other hand, the mass media and the Democratic Party react against this proposal. Besides , however Tramp belongs to the Republic Party, part of the Republic Party objected to this. To prevent this proposal, those opponents oppose strongly."
6397,"The argument of Bill Gates is very interesting for me, because I am taking the nature-science class in which I discuss the environmental and energy-technological matter with my classmates. In my opinion, the capitalism regarding environment comes to a turning point. In days go by, economy consisted of mass production and mass consumption, and companies needed to contribute to the prevention of the destruction of environment as they can possible in their production. In other words, the main point was thoroughly the production activity and the protection of green was secondary. But, now we have no choice but realize the limitation of capitalism, as Bill Gates and the public surveys pointed out. We must turn the direction toward the combination of economy and environment. We must think about them at the same time, as 'greenery production'. For example, there suggested 'emission right' in the recent national business. The country which failed to achieve certain mark must pay money to 'buy' the emission right from the one which succeeded. This system is exactly capitalistic, and environmental trade. In addition, I think it is possible for consumers to make companies contribute to the protection of environment well, such as volunteering and making less CO2 emissions. If they start to buy the eco-products as priority, thanks to the principle of market, the companies might also start to focus on them competitively. So we can improve the present situation made by capitalism, using the capitalism itself. Of course this is very difficult plan to achieve because the present economy system relying on fossil soil cannot change quickly. But I think we must to do so in the long run in order to do with the limited natural resources in the future."
6398,"I think this problem is very difficult and important to think about crime law system. Now I belong to the law department of Keio university and study low. So I know complexity of this problem and I also know both girlfriend's life and mother's life are so Irreplaceable that I sure they cannot decide which they should save. In the first place, all life are holy equally. But now, often the rule is broken in foreign countries. It becomes the problem about the human rights in every country. And the murder must be permitted in no country. It is not permitted morally. So Cruel organization including IS must not be permitted. On the contrary, saving life is very splendid, I think. The person saving anyone should be praised. In this case, Though two people must have died, he was able to save one. When he get rid of another one, he must be troubled and sorry very much. So we should not make pursuit. He is innocent, I sure."
6399,"When I read this article, I was very surprised at the point that law students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. I think this problem is difficult to choose which is a crime. So, I wonder why this problem was set question for the National Judicial Exam. Therefore, I want to think about this problem from two situations. At first, I suppose that I am in a position to run the bar examination. I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen. If the situation happened and they didn't think about that, they couldn't cope with that situation correctly. And also, if they can't think about an unpredictable problem, they didn't work correctly as a lawyer, a judge. So, I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. Secondly, I'm going to think about this problem as a law student. I think this problem is unnecessary. Comparing girlfriend's life with mother' life is totally useless, To begin with, we should not consider that which life of person is more important. In this situation, we didn't know why he decided to save his girlfriend instead of his mother. I think he chose the best way that time. He could not save both his girlfriend and his mother. I think that he helped her like a man in a trance. He did not have the fault. He was exposed to dangerous states,too. The man who saved his girlfriend instead of his mother didn't break law. I think this problem was not suitable for the National Judicial Exam. In this way, I think about it in tow situations. Personally, I prefer the opinion of law student. We should not compare the weight of life. I think this problem is unnecessary in the National Judicial Exam."
6400,I was surprised to read this article. At first I don't understand why they put a question like this on National Judicial Exam. Because I do not think there exits the right answer. Also I don't think we should choose any of which because our lives are equal. I will never understand why they put those questions on the National Exam and they really should haven't. In addition to that Chinese people should complain about the sexist nature of the question. Since the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Chinese female should speak out for that.
6402,"I was very surprised when I read this article, because China give a quiz without answer in a national examination. It is different by a person which people help mother or girl friend. National examination is very important examination for keeping the security of the country. And the answer to this problem will be related to the sense of values of the country, so people cannot answer easily this question. Therefore I think that it not good to give a quiz without the answer in a national examination. However if this quiz is given me, I answer that I help my mother, because my mother brought me up and girl friend is still young."
6403,"I agree with you. I was very surprised and this news is bad. This question leads to the discrimination of the person. I think that there must not be the discrimination. And if this question is given me, I help mother, too. Probably many people will be same answer. However I think that we should not answer such a question. I wish that thought of China changes."
6404,"I disagree with you. If I live in United States, at first I agree with Trump's proposal. But for a second I think better of something, I will change my opinion. United States , the land of freedom, so I will value freedom of everyone. Surely ISIS's terrorism are very dangerous and people who live in United States are exposed scary emotions. All of the Muslims are not dangerous. So nation should not set an example of moderation to others."
6405,"I agree with you. Donald Trump's plan is not solution for terrorism of Islamic power. Recently, a lot of terrorism happen. In 2015, two Japanese men were killed by IS. When I heard this news, I was surprised and frightened because I have thought that Japan had not had a relationship to terrorism. This happening made me feel terrorism close to Japan. Actually, IS killed many people. The dead can't revive. IS is foolish. However, IS isn't responsible for all terrorism. In my opinion, each country doesn't make efforts to understand each other. It is true that there are difference of language, culture and religion and that people tend to be opposed by these differences, but that is no reason for each country's not understanding each other. I don't think that people know each other well enough to hate them. In spite of not knowing each other, people may hate them. I think that is most terrible thing. There aren't awful thing than ignorance. Today's society progresses globalization. You can visit America, UK, Brazil, India and Kenya and acquire knowledge of other countries easily. If you hope the world peace, I think you should continue to learn. Under globalization, you should visit many countries and learn in order to understand each other."
6406,I agree with you very much. We should not settle the worth of others 'lives because our lives are equal. This question is terribly unsuitable for the National Exam in two points. First point is that the answer and thought about which is more cherished differ from person to person. Second point is that this question is a kind of sexist. I think China have to develop in the aspect of not only economic but also morality. Chinese people have to demand that the government respect the human rights.
6407,"I do not support Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration. I was shocked with the fact that he cited what President Franklin D Roosevelt had done during World War Ⅱ. I know many Japanese were suffered by the segregation at that time. History is here for us to never repeat the same mistake. I understand that countries have to secure themselves, but there must be better ways to do that. As former Senator Rick Santorum pointed out in the article, banning all immigration will not help securing us from terrorists. It is because terrorists often prepare a camouflage certification in order to enter the country. Good Muslims do not lie, but they will be rejected by Trump's act. It is just incomprehensible. Also, by reading this article and other comments of Trump or supporters, I felt they do not have evidence at all."
6408,"Donald J. Trump has been criticized for his rampant and discriminatory remarks against women, Brazilian, and Muslims. These discrimination is completely not appropriate for public statesman of US which is called the land of liberty, respecting equality and freedom. But he still obtaining many votes now. I think the reason is his origin. He succeeded in the business of fixed proposal, and made a great amount of money. And he has performed in TV shows. So, he knows how to appeal well to citizens through TV. In fact, his behaves are always focused on by mass media. In addition, he knows about the desires of those who belong to the conservative class, and then trying to grant them by banning immigrations or stopping the decline of social welfare. I think in fact he will not be the president because there is another likely winner, but what we should pay attention to is the fact that the number of people who support him is not so small. The American's value may be changing now."
6409,"I strongly agree with you. I also think that this exam asked the student how they do when they are forced to answer the ultimate question. They must have worried when they looked at the question at first, but this might be the just purpose of the National Judicial Exam."
6410,"I think that modern capitalism reached to meet its demise. First of all, modern capitalism was formed in the 19century's Industrial revolution period. But we can say that modern capitalism is not a perfect system. We can say it by looking at Russian Revolution in 1917. Modern capitalism is a system capitalists who have the tools of produce hire laborers to produce products. But profits by producing is monopolized by capitalists. So, the gulf between laborers and capitalists get deeper and deeper. And progress of globalization, the scale of market expanded to the whole world over. Therefore, present modern capitalism system can't catch up with the change of economy in recent years. Now that things have come to this pass, the gap between rich and poor. So, we should think alternative economical system that can be everyone equal."
6411,"I think Mr. Trump's insistence shows that The American peoples fear. The ISIS and other extremist group of Islam are now be well though Europe and North America's military act especially Aerial bombing. A long time history make them compromise difficult and extremist group of Islam hate America's intervention of the Middle East. It proved the event of 9.11 terrorism. Being based on these facts, I think Mr.Trumps insistence is extremely natural action but I don't agree with this opinion. I think it have to divide the Extremist group and other normal Islamic people. Most of Islamic people live normally with strict dogma. They also have human right including right to entrance into America and America is the country of freedom and emigration. It must not refuse people unconditionally for reasoning who is Islamic people. He said America did same regulation at WW2, but after the war president discern that action fault and apologized after time. If America do the same mistake, it will be shame after time. However, from the security sight it is necessary to refuse people who has dangerous mind. Paris terrorism proved there is nowhere to safe though far from battlefield. I think from now the nation security is wanted to tell the different between dangerous people and the other people without invading human right."
6412,"I disagree with you. I think that Japan is never a very safe country. Actually, a Japanese was killed recently by an Islamic nation. This incident is the beginning of nightmare. As for the next, the Islamic nation may attack a land of Japan directly. However, indeed, the Japanese who roused attention increased, but there is still little number of people. I think that the media should report more cases minutely. Outlook on ethic surely becomes the problem when the cruel scene is reported. However, the nation will not move by oneself unless they know seriousness and the cruelty of the case. Possibly, there may be the person becoming upset by seeing the news. Possibly, there may be the person who is shocked by looking at the real picture. However, we must look it in the face as a person living in the present age as far as it is plain reality."
6413,"I see your point, but I have a little different idea from yours. I think that the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize is not to measure the peace, but to praise some people who worked hard for peace. Of course it in not good that the reason of choosing is uncertain and there is the risk of the prize badly exploited by the government. But the most important point is due to winning the Peace Prize, the winner will get strong supporters around the world and the problem he or she had worked about will be known widely around the world. So I think this prize is meaningful."
6414,"I have a different idea. Some developing countries such as India or China are occupying high rates of the entire CO2 emission of the whole world. So they are also responsible for the improvement to some extent. And, I think what is important for the future energy is 'energy mix', using both natural resources and thermal, nuclear ones. Every energy has each good points or bad points. So we must use them effectively."
6416,I agree with you. There must be certain reason why the terrorists or these offensive statesman are appeared. We tend to forget to understand them and simple criticize or suppress them. This is not the original solution. We should think about their background again.
6417,"I think that his speech and his thinking is understandable for me. Terrorism scares us so much, therefore, I want to avoid that kind of danger by using all means necessary. However, Trump's speech lacks consideration. It can not be that all Muslims have risky thinking and wield violence. He takes things too easy. His speech includes prejudice to Muslims, it is misunderstanding like the following example of Japanese people, many foreigners think that Samurai or Ninja really exist in Japan. There are a lot of news or interviews which show that people who believe Islam say that we are not terrorists like ISIS and ask us not to misunderstand this fact."
6418,"At first, I can't get understand this news clearly. I haven't seen 'Star Wars' ever, so those names mentioned in this article were odd to me, except Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another stronger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are costumed in character costumes and it is allowed. In Japan, I think there is a tacit understanding that such jokes are not suitable for political situations. I have taken it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which this article mentions. However, I don't think their style is incorrect. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan recently. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to 'joke' candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a 'joke' candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. Star Wars' character is a good example. In conclusion, freedom of political activity should be permitted in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances."
6420,"I don't know about Tunisia very much, but I can say what they do should be praised. But they must not be satisfied with it and they should continue making an effort to make Tunisia better more. Certainly still Tunisia's peace and order is very bad, I heard. So the effort must be necessary and other countries should help there. this is also important. Certainly developed countries are giving aid, but the social system is not improved only for money. They also should give knowledge. Though too advice is not good, the advice helps so much. And now it becomes the problem about Nobel peace prize. I want to say they should pay more attention to other problems more. Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet pushed forward one step of the beginning and from now more problem will be disappear. So they should think about the problem and other country will have to help them. These are the way to improve the poor country, I think."
6422,"I think that this man was the sarcasm to the Russia. First in the movie, Chewbacca was forced to work at the Galactic Empire. Later Han Solo saved Chewbacca and they cooperated to overthrow Galactic Empire. In Ukraine, historically, there were two parties. The party that supports Russia and the party that supports EU. These days, the problem of Crimea is the huge problem in the world. The problem of Crimea between Ukraine and Russia is difficult and hard to understand. So I quote the website of HAARETS, 'Crimea was absorbed into the Russian empire along with most of ethnic Ukrainian territory by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. Russia's Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol was founded soon afterwards. More than half a million people were killed in the Crimean War of 1853-56 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which was backed by Britain and France. The conflict reshaped Europe and paved the way for World War One. In 1921, the peninsula, then populated mainly by Muslim Tatars, became part of the Soviet Union. The Tatars were deported en masse by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the end of World War Two for alleged collaboration with the Nazis.' And why Crimea is the part of Russia? 'Crimea only became part of Ukraine when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to his native land in 1954. This hardly mattered until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine. Despite that, nearly 60 percent of its population of 2 million identify themselves as Russians. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been periodic political tussles between over its status between Moscow and Kiev.' I think that this man wanted to raise a doubt about the problem between Russia and Ukraine."
6423,"I agree with you! Of course, every country and everyone are afraid of the terrorism. Now we can not predict where the terrorism will occur. But, as you said, a exclusive way of foreign policy would arose other people and lead to causing new terrorism. The U.S. should feel for the fundamental way to solve the problem."
6424,"I agree with your opinion. I think that the story of Star Wars is very very difficult. It was the time of the primary schoolchild that I saw Star Wars for the first time, but was not able to understand the contents of the story at all. The only memory to remember clearly is that a light saver is very cool. I was not able to understand even the face and the name of character and not know Chewbacca either. And I think that it is ban to mix every play for election, too. The holy activity which called the election should be carried out faithfully and anybody must not elect someone in for fun. The politician chosen by election represents the country. If one step is wrong, there is the risk to become the catastrophe that may shake the basis of the country. May I participate with a costume play as election including such risk? By a serious appearance, should I not participate in election with a faithful feeling. It may be surely a good thing to add a simple image to election so that many people participate in the election with the too faithful image. This is because the youth's keeping away from election is remarkable. In this time when the election participation rate decreases, the plan that is such a catchy may be the measure. It may be a good thought, but, I think that, in election,the faithfulness that is one of the important requirement must meet it."
6426,"I think that the test makers of this exam should consider another situation. Because in this modern society, many things would happen. So, lawyers takes many tasks which we cannot expect. In this exam, the test clearly assumes the test-takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Test makers do not consider woman's situation. If her house is burning, should woman save her husband, boyfriend, son, or grandfather? If we think about that problem, we have to consider the points which is different from men's situation. For example, in common sense woman is consider to be weak. So, her husband says she save herself. Or after this happening, many people say 'Why don't you save your daughter? As those many things change from his situation. Lawyers should deal with many difficult tasks. Let's look at Japanese situation. In Japan, the equality of woman and man is written in the Japanese law. So, above the law, if woman don't save her husband, nothing is problem. A statement of fundamental rights and privileges (especially the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution) is written in japan too. As above, many things change in another countries. China has been a complex mix of traditional Chinese approaches and Western influences. Lawyer have to solve many difficult problem according to the custom of his county. The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today. I think this topic's problem comes from these Chinese tradition."
6427,"I agree with your opinion. It was the time of the primary schoolchild that I saw Star Wars for the first time, but was not able to understand the contents of the story at all. The only memory to remember clearly is that a light saver is very cool. I was not able to understand even a face and the name of the character and did not know Chewbacca either.

This is because keeping away from election of the youth is remarkable. In this time when the election participation rate decreases, the plan that is such a catchy may be the measure. It may be a good thought, but, in election, the faithfulness that is one of the important requirements must meet it. A question remains whether the election that important requirements fell out is really reliable election. I think that In election, both a person with the right to vote and the person having eligibility for election should participate in election seriously."
6428,"I don't agree with your opinion. I can understand your point of view. However I don't think that Nobel Peace Prize is not fair and correct in u time. Of course, there are some prize winners who are not suitable, but I think most prize winners make remarkable achievements Besides I think judges are always fair and never influenced by personal feelings"
6429,"I like Bill Gate's word in this sentence very much. It is 'The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else.' In recent years, global warming has become a world problem. And global warming is interlinked with climate change because global warming changes the patterns of the weather world-wide. Climate change can cause serious problems for wild animals. Furthermore, it has a significant impact on food production. Concern for these climate change problems has been growing in recent years on a global scale. Therefore, the issue of global warming is important on a global scale and must be addressed over the long-term. So, it is crucial to support measures taken by rich countries to cope with climate change. Have people in rich countries ever thought about global warming? Climate change is a global problem and they live in a global environment. This is because tackling climate change and living of people must be compatible. Therefore, I felt that every single person must reconsider global warming. For example, if people wear cooler clothes in their offices during the summer, they can turn down their air-conditioners and, as a result, help to reduce global warming. So, It is very important that deepening the understanding of the general public concerning the current situation of global warming and the importance of global warming countermeasures."
6430,"I don't think Nobel Prize Committee should be make cancel system because ,if so, the trust of Nobel Prize would shake. Even today the reliance of it is weak. Of course, winner of it do bad action after awarded, but it is unnecessary to cancel because they deserves a point in this time. In order to keep this system effective as much as possible, there is nothing for it except for keeping today's system."
6431,"I did not know that the Nobel Peace Prize are having such problems. I believed completely that Nobel Peace Prize was great award. But this thinking changed after reading this article. Especially, I was surprised by news about Obama. Obama has done four things roughly. First, he has created a new opportunity in international politics as president. Second, he claimed the role that can be played by the United Nations and other international organizations, and multilateral diplomacy has regained a central position. Third, he claimed as means for solving the most difficult international conflicts, dialogue and negotiation should be priority. Fourth, he claimed a principle Without nuclear weapons in the world, and it gave a powerful stimulus to the disarmament and arms control negotiations. Thanks to Obama's initiative, the United States has played a constructive role than ever before. As a result he had won the Nobel Peace Prize. However, now, in Iraq, Syria, and Afghanistan, Obama is killing a lot of civilians by using the combat drone. Do we permit to declare such person was awarded as the Nobel Peace Prize winner? Of course, anyone will answer No. Obama should return this prize as soon as possible. In addition, in order to become the award that anyone can trust the Nobel Peace Prize, future activities of people who are likely to award should also guess. It is necessary to determine whether the winner is appropriate until the person dies. In addition, peace and justice are iffy and unstable. So, by ideas, perspectives and position, we can be a variety of evaluation. There will are strict regulations in the Nobel Committee of Norwegian a national assembly, but so long as absolutely neutral fair evaluation is impossible, danger which political implications arise can't avoid. Nobel Peace Prize is given for the person who do my best in fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing army and for the holding and promotion of peace conference. If we respect the bequest of Nobel, piercing 'no winner' except for a person anyone accept will be wise choice. We hope that Nobel Peace Prize will be a thing that has significant value someday."
6432,"I had thought the person who won the Novel Prize has to go forward to world peace. But after reading this article, I've come to have doubt my consideration. At the end of this article, Henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin are introduced as a person who were nominated Novel prize. When I was at historical classroom, I learned about these people's achievements. I had a very bad impression of these people such like evil. Because they killed many people. According to this article, Kissinger actually was 'implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America'. Therefore I thought why they are nominated in the past. I think there are a lot of people who are more valuable nominated Novel Prize than them. I do not really know about the choosing system in Novel prize. But from now on, the system should be under the discussion. If people receive Novel prize, they can take a lot of money. Those money should be used to make our world peace and to promote peace other areas of the world. So the prize winner should be chosen more carefully than past."
6433,"At first, I want to praise Mr.Trump's act before I express my opinion. According to the article, even as he reflected citizen's view, he was criticized by several politicians. I think it is very difficult thing to say one's own real opinion regardless of impressions of people around one. I believe he is honest person. Then, I agree with him. Certainly, banning Muslim immigration is a little outrageous and lead to increase refugees. Also, some people may think he is disqualified to the president. However I think Trump's policy is very simple and the most certain one to prevent crime or terrorism like Paris committed by Muslim immigrants. I also think citizens and many politicians may secretly believe his policy is correct in their hearts, but can't say it outside because they don't want to be considered outrageous. I want to ask them 'What is your really thinking?' Although refusing immigrants is unjust act, citizens should think about the right way to protect themselves from terrorism once again."
6434,"I agree with your opinion. I think climate problem must be solved by developed countries, the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. However, the developed countries do not want to cooperate with the developing countries very much. In addition to this, there are the problems created in the international community by the differences between developed countries and developing countries. Both of them are worldwide important matters. Moreover, measures against poverty problems and widening income inequality are insufficient. So, a global crisis requires a global solution. I am sure the developing world and the developed world can solve climate change problem and economic disparity by helping each other. And it is very important thing for people of developed countries to think what they can do in order to help people of developing countries."
6435,"Donald Trump criticized the terrorism of the Islamic nation. I agree to his opinion in this respect, too. Terrorism is a cold-blooded cruel political act to involve the people at large without relations. The posture to say to threaten a country using terrorism is cold-blooded, but I am regrettable at a point to take a holy life away above all. What is what we should make to get rid of terrorism? For a country using terrorism, I think that it is important that we establish the place of the official exchange of opinions. By various circumstances, each country may not contact the country using terrorism, but I think about the method that I can solve immediately only for this. When it can establish the place of the exchange of opinions, it is to hear the say of the country to be the most important. However, you must never compromise so that we get peace. You must find a compromise in the request of the country somewhere, but must be never at the mercy of the country. It is easy to think, but it is difficult to act. Actually, it is still far from realization, but I believe that we are able to realize it sometime because each country makes constant efforts. At that time, it is the greatest if the Islamic nation becomes the healthy religious group."
6436,"I disagree with your opinion. Certainly, what you said is correct, that's to say, Muslims are not always those who bring about terrorism. However I think it is 'an armchair theory.' If I were one of the citizens, I don't want to admit terrorists to come into my country. There are few possibilities that one immigrant is terrorist, but percentage is not 0. Therefore I don't think Mr,Trump's policy is wrong and dangerous. It is an ordinary judgment."
6437,"When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, I think this kind of question is a bad question. Why do I think so? Because this kind of question's answer varies to each one's own. I think one's most important things is not defined by one things. Our treasure of life piles up by many occasions. For example, one can make person who can give one's precious love, one is blessed with children, and everyday petty concerns. In this way, our choice of most important things can be different case by case, so this kind of question force to choose only one thing. Therefore this question's answer cannot cast from a single mold. Secondly, this question was a question of national judicial exam. Originally, public examination's answer like National Judicial examination should be only one absolute answer. But as I mentioned before, this kind of question varies person to person, so we cannot make suggested answer by tangible standard. By the way I would like to look this topic from other viewpoints. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam was controversial on online, for it is too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous and must be think deeply. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person at ease. So, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficulties they will faced with in the future career of lawyer, judge, or a jurist. The students took the exam were candidates who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very difficult perhaps nearly impossible to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make one fair tangible answer everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), I think it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job"
6438,"I understood your theory. However, I do not know if I agree with you. I think, the really poor can not have the will that they want to study in order to enter the university. The poor you assume are who enter the university by using the scholarship. But, there are children who must work to live. Of course, they have their dream and they might want to learn. As a practical matter, however, there are families can not live by their own income. As you said, the opinion that the poor can be rich is also the fact. However, that need their strong will and lack. For example, they need monetary aid and understanding of the surrounding. Compared to it, the rich can be rich easier. Both of the poor and the rich have opportunities, but it is never equal. So, I think, the opinion that 'The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies' is right On the whole."
6439,"I have the same idea as yours. This question will lead to discriminate among lives. As you said, 'regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance.' The answer of this question is not important, this question's existence in itself is the important matter. What there is an answer is wrong. At the same time, I can't believe this exam assumed male examinees. Is it able to say to discriminate gender as the mother and the girlfriend? Although I want to be a lawyer in the future, I became afraid about equality. I'll keep my opinion in mind."
6440,"I disagree with your idea. If I were a member of that country, I don't want them to enter in my country because there is a possibility to happen a terrorism. To be sure, your opinion is good, but the problem of terrorism is very difficult and it is a international problem. We Japanese also should think carefully about it."
6441,"When I read this article for the first time, I cannot hide my surprise. I think this opinion like driving out immigrants. Immigrants immigrate various reasons. Their home country is in civil war or is inhabitable because of natural disasters. In recent years, The Middle East areas are in crisis because of IS raise its head. IS members consists of not only local people but also European Muslim people. Why European Muslim people take part in IS? I think there are religious reasons. In the past days, many European countries make their colonies in Africa, Eastern-Europa, and Middle East areas. After World WarⅡ, these colonies are independent of suzerain powers. But in many cases, economy and politics can't be stable. So, many people immigrate to suzerain powers looking forward getting job and making their new lives. But after they arrive at European countries, they were exposed to discrimination by local people because of religious and rational reasons. By many years of discrimination, immigrants hold dissatisfaction. In this situation, young people are likely to be attracted by utopia like IS which explains Muslim's specialty. I think recent terrorists' attacks were led by previous European countries' actions, so we should consider immigrant problem more seriously. The problem is more serious than we are thinking."
6442,"I think his statement and action is bravery. Apparently, it is not good to ban all Muslims, but If I were a citizen of accept country, I'm scared because there is a possibility to take place a terrorism, so I think it is good to ban them entering. In addition, terrorism is international problem, so people all over the world ought to think carefully about it."
6443,"I'm opposed to your opinion. Of course, I think it is important that the person who has power like Bill Gates say his or her opinion. However, I wonder it's just enough. I think it is important that more people advocate. About China's environment problems, I agree with your opinion. The environment problems that China is facing are serious and varied, and are large in scale. With the economic growth, resources and energy consumption has rapidly increased to create environmental problems. So, each of Chinese people must strive to solve the country's environmental problems. And it seems to be important for Japan to utilize its technological capabilities, its experience in dealing with energy and environmental problems, and so forth to contribute to resolving the issues that China is facing."
6444,"This news is very humorous and interesting, I think. Star Wars is known all over the world, so Ukraine's Internet Party should have attracted attention of many people. To collect votes this is very effective. In Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics. Their name and character must be known to many people. These resemble closely very much, I think. These are effective to collect votes, you know. But I want to say this situation is not always good. Even if it was a famous person, he may not work good. The mistake is not permitted in the politics. So a person with the knowledge should do politics, I sure. It is interesting as far as I see it from the other place, but if a candidate like this news appears in Japan, I must doubt."
6445,"When I read the title of this article for the first time, I thought that what Chewbacca is because I am not familiar with 'Star Wars'. While I went on reading the part of beginning, I felt that is funny and even wanted a incident such this article to take place in Japan because absolutely a incident like this never happen in Japan.Until I finish reading the part of end, indeed I did not even think that there was a deep political background. Because I studied world history at time of the high school student, I knew that Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union, but I surely did not still know that power of West Europe is opposed to power of the Russian-supporting rebels in Ukraine now. Because Ukraine is located between West Europe and Eastern Europe, the position of Ukraine is delicate politically and geographically. After all, I want Ukraine to become democratic in the same way as Japan, but at first it should be first priority to stabilize domestic politics. If it becomes so, Chewbacca will not fall into the dark side."
6446,"I think that this problem of Chinese bar examination is fantastic. I will do choice to help mother if I say forcibly. A woman called mother is mother all the time from now on. However, the girlfriend may not be so. Mother is existence of only the one in space. Furthermore, the correct answer seemed to be mother in the answer of Chinese Ministry of Justice. Still, this problem is very interesting because we can get a glimpse of the human's nature."
6449,"I agree with your opinion. I also think this question is very serious problem. We should not prioritize the value of life. Why did person setting this question set it? I can not understand it. However, there may be Chinese cultural background which Japanese can not understand. So, if we thought this problem deeply, we would need to know not only it but also Chinese cultural background. Personally, I have a Chinese friend. So, I want to ask him how he thinks about this problem."
6450,"I think he just likes to stand out. He wants everyone to pay attention to him. First of all, what he is saying is totally a racist. He says it was a temporary move in response to terrorism. I understand every single person in the world is being afraid of the attack of terrorism, but why would he say such things in the public if he wants to be the president of the United States. That just make his reputation worth. There are some Muslim people living in United States, and I cannot imagine how much they feel offended by that remark. Since Mr trump made such a remark in front of everyone, I understand that everyone criticize about him, even the White House. This article says there are some people who thinks his remark was plausible and natural. Those are people of conservative commentators and they think that comments reflected the electorate's view s more honestly than the party's leaders. However, there are thing you should say and should not in public, even when they really think so. Because he is not a three years old, he is an adult and he even owns a company. He should know it by now. Be a humane. In the article, it says 'former Senator Rick Santorum, seemed to embrace Mr. Trump's impulse but differed on the details.' and the details are that he's proposed actual concrete things and immigration law that would have-instead of banning all Muslims, but a lot of them. It might be true that United States need to get rid of the visa lottery system, but It doesn't have to be refined for only Muslim, because there are many immigrations from Mexico and other countries. Lastly I don't think he should be the next president of the United states, and I don't even want to think about the possibility of him being a president!! I want someone with no prejudice to be a president of the United States, because United States is the country with a strong power and many countries would follow his policy and the way it thinks."
6451,"I disagree with your opinion. There is some truth in what you say. However capitalism is not eternal but circular. Once upon a time China was called' the world's factory'. Corporations founded factories to seek cheap labor. China developed temporally, but when companies left China for other countries to seek cheaper labor, China began to decline gradually. When Chinese workforce became cheaper, corporations founded factories again. In this way the capitalism circulates around the world."
6452,"I agree with your opinions. If I were him, I would get confused. Both of them are important people for him. I can not choose only one person. It is strange that mother should be saved over his girlfriend. Indeed his girlfriend is likely to escape the fire on her own, but we should not treat their life irrespective of position. Life is equal. We must realize again the importance of it"
6453,"As for Nobel Peace prize in the present age, a selection standard is very vague and the prize winners is often criticized by people that he should not have won it. Therefore I think that people begin to have a question towards the value of Nobel Peace prize. The accurate selection will be necessary in the future so that Nobel Peace prize continues being a honorable prize by people."
6454,"I agree with your opinion greatly. I think they are excited by themselves only, don't admire the characters. And then, That this is acted at politics is dishonest. It shouldn't be resolved as a practical jokes."
6455,"Donald Tramp criticized for plan to ban Muslim immigration. I can understand idea that criticized for Tramp to ban immigration. Of course all Muslims don't be the radical people and it may become discrimination for Muslims. In Paris however accept immigration. The result of this, Paris public order is becoming less and less safe and the right wing of a party made a great advance in France. I agree with idea in parts of Tramp, I think that Too much accepting immigration can do more harm than good, I can understand his idea. The damage caused by 9.11 matter are enormous. And Recently, ISIS caused a historical unforgettable event. He deserves to have a sense of impending crisis. Indeed, He speak aggressive language and is overstatements. But, If I think accepting many immigration in Japan, many problem will develop for example, religion, culture, labor, etc. Especially, the point in labor is seriously. In Japan, these problem are developing and In Paris, these problem have developed. I think What Tramp should be criticized is lack of consideration of Muslim. His speech can cause misunderstanding that Muslim is dangerous race. Of course, it is not real. He should consider. This misunderstanding may become discrimination for Muslims. He must correct this point."
6456,"I totally agree with you. Terrorism is now one of the biggest affairs in the whole entire world right now. We are facing it and we cannot ignore it. However complaining or criticizing it doesn't help anything. Someone has to come up with the great idea which could solve the problem. And if Trump are not capable of coming up with the idea, he should avoid saying such a stupid things. He should have came up with the solution not the discrimination."
6457,"I knew only the title of Star Wars, but I did not know such detailed character of the name and the contents of the story. So it was difficult for me to understand what this article said. But I began to understand While I promoted reading. I was really surprised that such a political party is not a joke. To be outdone in Ukraine, This year, movie of STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is published in Japan and fan of star wars has also risen. in Ukraine, the number of candidates belonging to the political party 'Darth Vader Blocks' is 48 people. Of which 44 people are referring to themselves as the Vader. Ukrainians love Star Wars obsessively. This is no doubt and I thought Ukraine is humorous country. Although I think this party will not come out in Japan, if such a party do that, this will not solve laughing matter. In addition, it was further surprised to hear that candidate dressed as villain of the 'Star Wars' has won 54% of the support rate and been elected. He seems to become city council member in southwest Odessa of Ukraine. Elected politicians can play an important role to determine the management of the area. So, of course, such election results are not good. I think that the Ukrainians should think about my own country seriously. However, why was such a result? This situation doesn't represent that Ukrainians are stupid but a sign of dissatisfaction with politics .It sounds like people have claimed that ' Whatever people are selected, the politics will not change', 'the first place politicians are rotten.' I hope that Ukrainian politics is better and clever politicians are elected. Also, I hope that the people who do the efficient politics come out, so that Japan does not fall into a loss of public confidence in government."
6458,"I agree with your opinion. It is true that terrorism is serious problem all over the world now, and it is difficult to solve the problem. If America Islamic people to refuse entry into America, it will speed up extremist group of Islamic's terrorism. Of course terrorism problem is difficult to solve but refuse people unconditionally is the worst way to solve. We have to understand each other and start conversation to make settlement. If we will be attacked while the process, at the time I don't deny we have to use enforcement way but it have to limit object extremist people, we have not to including normal people. I think Mr. trump is misunderstanding these logic. He can't divide extremist people and not so I think."
6459,"I was surprised when I read your opinion, and I was convinced. After thinking it over carefully, it's a discrimination for girls. Surely, this article is lack of consideration. It was written in boys' view. We need a point of view of gender. For example, Boys don't necessarily save girls. So we need to consider some of gender problem."
6460,"I disagree with your opinion for two reasons. First, your guess that not only the general public but also politicians may secretly support Trump's insistence is way off the mark. Certainly Trump's policy may be good for America in the short run. However, his policy is clearly bad for not only America but also the international society in the long run. The general public and politicians who are against Trump really criticize him. Second, Trump will be bad for the Japanese people. Nevertheless are you for Trump? He affirms the internment of Japanese-Americans in WWII. And he tends to make light of Japan. If he becomes the President of USA, not only the American people but also the Japanese people will be unhappy. Therefore, I cannot help thinking that you are kidding."
6461,"This news was very unique, and it was a good chance for me to be interested in politics of Ukraine. However, in Ukraine that the political situation is unstable the incident occurred in other cities that the group of the secessionist who received the Russian support collided with Ukraine forces and the election canceled. Surely it looks like an interesting funny case. However, to be frank, I want all nations including dozen Vader to face the current political situation of Ukraine seriously and work hard to improve it…"
6462,"Trump gave an aggressive opinion many times so far. However, I think that this statement should not be permitted. The Islamic nation caused terrorism all over the world, and in these days, the incident in Los Angeles and Paris shook the world. The world main cities are threatened by terrorism. However, the statement of Trump considered the whole Muslims to be an Islamic nation and may make Muslims angry. In addition, the statement has the risk to expose innocent Muslims of the United States to discrimination and prejudice as American discriminatory statement caused the accident in Los Angeles.It cannot solve the problem fundamentally to prohibit immigration.It only leaves ruination in the future between Islam and the United States. Then how can the problem of the Islamic nation be settled fundamentally? 'Hate is not an American value,' Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter. However, the moderate method to be reconciled with an Islamic nation is difficult now.I cannot mention concrete solutions. However, It is important that we do not consider the Islamic nation to be Islam and must consider the Islamic nation to be one terrorist organization."
6463,"I could not understand the article too. I have not seen 'Star Wars'. Since many character were appeared in this article, it was difficult for me to grasp the contents. In Japan, election campaign is controlled strictly. Therefore such a strange accident do not happen.The Ukrainian government should take action against candidates for a cleaner form of democracy. Owing to loose regulation, local elections are lacking in discipline. The Ukrainian government have to solve the problem promptly for Ukrainians."
6464,"When I read this article, I thought that Mr. Trump's statement was improper. He thought about the safety of his own country, to be sure, but he was not concerned about international relations. It is necessary to tackle the problem that Muslims escape from the terror of terrorism. Since the problem is so serious, we have to think very carefully. For all its importance, his remark was too shallow. I think that his thought is filled with prejudice. Owing to his remark, it may be difficult for America to develop a good relationship with other countries. He should have humbly uttered his opinions on the problem. Not all Muslims are guilty. Since some Muslims commit a cruel crime, all Muslims tend to be discriminated. We should understand the international situation and solve the problem for the peaceful future."
6467,"I think this article is so difficult. Before I read it, I wonder the title of it. Why the capitalism cannot save us from climate change? I do not know the meaning. But, I sympathized this sentence. ' The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies.' I think this means the bad side of capitalist economies. The capitalism has two kinds of people. These are capital and labor. A capital is the leader of his company and it is under the command of him. So, of curse, capitals are the rich and labors are the poor. This happens the difference of people and society. The presidents of their companies hope they will become bigger and advance into foreign market. I think this causes climate change. Most of big companies may influence the environment of the earth. By the way, I was surprised at the fact of surging ahead of China's green investment. My impression of China is many population and terrible air pollution. In contrast to my thoughts, China is going ahead with the construction of power stations of solar. To stop greenhouse gas emission, I think the best mean is the change of the source of fuels. For example, there are solar power generation system, hydraulic power generation geothermal power generation and so on. Solar power generation is the most efficient generation and so low cost. I like it and many families in the world try to install it on their houses' roof. This helps cutting off their cost of electricity and stopping global warming. I think more countries and families should introduce it."
6468,"I think this problem is very difficult question. As you say, there are not any people who only do a noble act. On the other hand, everyone won't be able to admit the criminal one. Basically, I have the same idea as yours, so I don't want to abolish the Nobel peace prize. The meaning of this prize is not only praising the winner but also teaching everyone winner's noble act. Therefore, even if the winner does unworthy deed, the prize shouldn't be abolished to leave winner's achievements for the future. However, I also think that the peace prize cannot continue to exist. I have had some doubts about the basis of the prize for long time. That is to say, the basis of it is vaguer than other prizes'. I think the prize has no concrete standards, so winning it is too difficult for general people. In verity, the number of famous winner is much more than general winner in this prize. Then, I'm afraid of retaining the prize. As I have said, the problem of the Nobel peace prize is quite difficult."
6469,"I agree with your opinion. I also think all country should share information about pollution too. I have had a image which china is country wasting energy. However, in reality, China has been using resources effectively. If I don't read this article, I will not know the truth forever. In addition, I was surprised that other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan also should emulate these countries. I hope that many countries have the consciousness which make it eco-friendly and we can live not to harm the earth. Although the environment problem is very serious in 21 century, this situation was created by people. So, it is necessary for us to take responsibility. The policy of the country is important ,but each person's consciousness is more important. Let's cooperate together so that a global environment improves!"
6470,"Bill Gates is right, and I think that the capitalism destroys environment. The company which is driven by production in the capitalism demands a profit. The company produces a large quantity of products to get a profit and originates the latest product in sequence again and distributes it. Speed to release a new product in the world increases year by year in the present age and the energies consumed to suffer from production continue increasing. In this situation it is obvious that energy of the earth dries up. Should I remember Japanese traditional mind 'saving' and 'mottainai' now? And the construction of the system of the really sustainable economy that is not capitalism and not communism will be necessary."
6471,"I was interest in acceptance of immigration in Japan after reading this article. So, I checked it. First of all, I explain the situation about immigrants in Japan. Now, The number of registered foreigners is 2200000 , and it is accounted for many parts by Asian people and Japanese-Brazilians. But the concept of acceptance of immigrants is insufficiency in Japan. There is only the policy of accepting foreign workers. On this immigration policy, the system which accepts foreigner as worker is not perfect. Next, I would like to talk about three merits of acceptance of immigrants. First, hiring of younger human resources. Japan has decreased birthrate and increased aging population, so I can expect that If acceptance of immigrants is possible , they will shoulder Japanese society. Now, on many field, workforce is insufficiently by only Japanese, for example: welfare-service ,agriculture and forestry. Already, in care field, many Filipinos have worked. In decreasing birthrate and aging population age, immigrants must be important workforce. Second, a different culture is introduced by immigrants and New service and industry come up. In addition, the consciousness of Japanese will be internationalized by cultural exchange. Third, Japanese value from all over the world changes. Now, Japanese culture and life style are evaluated highly, but future prospects are evaluated negatively. If Japan erases this nation by the opening of a country, good relationship will build between Japan and other countries. However , there is a demerit of acceptance of immigrants. Some people have negative image of immigrants. They think immigrants bring deterioration of public order''Difficulty of finding work' 'Culture problem' and reduction of Japanese people's employment' etc... At this point, I would like to tell this images are perceived notion. According to date of crime of foreign residents, immigrants increase, otherwise, the number of crime decrease more 30000 cases. And more, in reality, There are nations overcome this and success. So, I think demerit of acceptance of immigrants is almost nonexistent. In conclusion, immigrants bring Japan three good influence. They are hiring of younger human resources, coming up new service and industry and changing Japanese value to Japan. So, I agree with acceptance of immigrants in Japan!"
6472,"I agree with your opinion.Certainly,his policy is very simple and the most certain one to prevent crime or terrorism like Paris committed by Muslim immigrants.Indeed, In Paris, accepting refugees caused becoming less and less safe and the right wing of a party made a great advance in France.French have fatigue. Immigrant is looking for a job in Japan too.But it is difficult for them to looking a job. I heard they are cause becoming less and less safe in France. If that is the case, I can understand Tramp idea that delete possibility to producing terrorism."
6474,"After I read this article, I was confused about Nobel Peace Prize. I can't understand what is Nobel Peace Prize and what the purpose of giving Nobel Peace Prize. For example, if person or people finish a war peacefully without using military force, I think it is value for him/her or them to deserve Nobel Peace Prize. But there are gap between ideal and reality. I remember Eisaku Sato when I think Nobel Peace Prize. He advocated 'hikaku 3 gensoku'. It is about three principals of a nuclear weapon. He won the Nobel Peace Prize because he ONLY advocated it. He didn't do anything. He didn't generate anything. He only said. Therefore, it is easy to win the Nobel Peace Prize. What the purpose of Nobel Peace Prize. I think it is lack of influence too. I think there is not any change after winning it. So I think it because a mere name. It is waste of money possibly. We may not be need it. So we should consider it."
6475,"I think that this question is too difficult. Our lives are equal and should be equal. So the question which makes students choice which to help is ridiculous and nonsense. And I cannot believe that China's Ministry of Justice said that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. They mean helping girlfriends over parents is illegal. However if I were in such a situation, probably I would choose to help my mother. There are some reasons why I think so. First, mother is only one. Nobody can take place of her and my mother raised me for a long time. The other reason is that girlfriend is younger than mother. So the possibility of escape of girlfriend is higher than mother. For these reasons I would choose to help my mother. However I hope this kind of situation will not come true."
6477,"It is natural for the yes or no to the opinion that Trump expressed as measures to a Muslim to be divided. The opinion of Trump is radical. However, the crisis may be in the face so that such this opinion appears. The degree of risk such as the terrorism in Paris getting higher in the European and American developed country. It is difficult for me to understand that the opinion of Trump and critics. However, I feel that I must think about this problem well."
6478,"I agree with your opinion. International society should cope with terrorism. No matter how cruel treatment they receive, revenges depends on violence must not be permitted. I also think that we must not regard specific religion as radical and offensive. These prejudice makes believer of specific religion more and more aggressive. So, we should consider many backgrounds of present international affairs."
6479,"I agree with your opinion. I understood in particular ' I think we have to know their efforts and activities before people criticize them'. In reality, there are many people who don't know their efforts and activities. I think such people do not have a qualification to criticize. So, first of all, it is important for us to understand definitely. If people still have critical opinions after they consider that facts, they should raise their voice in public, I think so too."
6480,"I disagree with your opinion. Although, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get higher wages than past. However, I think that they cannot become the genuine 'rich'. Because even though employee's wage get higher, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Moreover, during those period the rich would get wealthier. In addition, poor employee cannot catch up with the wealthy people. By looking at these point, the gap between rich and poor expands more and more."
6481,"I agree with you. This kind of question doesn't have genuine correct answer. Person's life should be viewed equally each person. If we come across this kind of ultimate situation, we should choose a choice which any regret doesn't remain behind our choice."
6482,"I disagree with you in that you think the Novel Peace Prize should be abolished. For sure, the person who was not good for the Novel Prize won it, and Alfred Nobel, who made the Novel Peace Prize, himself invented dynamite which is the weapon of indiscriminate murder. And what is most important thing is that other prize winner, like Martin Luther King, Jr. , Mother Teresa, who was good for the Novel Peace Prize truly were to be pitied. I think you are right. However, I think the Novel Peace Prize should be retained. Of course, there many problems in this prize. The standard of selection should be reconsidered and the system the awarded persons will be canceled when they act unsuitable action should be introduced. If the Novel Peace Prize were abolished, conventional prize winners would be shocked. So, I think the secretive Nobel committee should reconsider what the Novel Prize is in order to get back it's prestige."
6484,"I was shocked at terrorism of Muslim at Paris in last year. Many people were dead by the radicals of Muslim. I cannot understand why they did such a cruel incident and are there any feelings of apology in their minds? Many bereaved families sunk in sorrow from that incident. How do we eradicate terrorism? I cannot understand it and only can hope there will be a peaceful world. By the way, I am angry at Mr. Trump's comments. He said that the United States should block all Muslims from entering their country. Why does he think all Muslims are the same people? There are so many Muslims all over the world, so we can't think all of them have the same opinion of their god and the scripture of Islam. Mr. Trump could not understand this point. After a few days of that terrorism, I watched such a report in evening news. There are many Muslims in Paris. And then, they all said,' We are not terrorists! We can't have cruel ideology. Please understand ourselves!' I felt they are so pitiful. So many people in the world may misunderstand that Muslims have dangerous ideas, like Mr. Trump. Also, I agree with Hillary Clinton. She said that hate is not American value. What a wonderful comment! I thought it. She realizes we cannot make the real peaceful world by hate and violence. I impressed her courageous comments. We should recognize Muslims. They are not bad people. It is important that we will admit our misunderstanding."
6485,"I know Malala Yousafzai. The heart of millions of people 'Malala' has finally won the Nobel Peace Prize in the youngest age in the history, She made history this time. Malala was nominated for Nobel Peace Prize in 2013 but She did not succeed last year. In 2014, She and Indian activist Kailash Satyriasis won the award jointly. However, Malala has become the youngest person among the people who have been honored with this award. She accepted the award and dedicated it to the young girls and women who are still far from the schools &amp; education. Malala - the youngest human activist in the world who has been struggling for her own and other girls' education since the age of 9 years, She has been awarded many big awards such as Heroic Women of the Year Award ,Sakharov Human Rights Award ,Glamour Women Award of the Year and Many More . She has been in the hearts of millions of people around the world, and the love and respect people has shown for Malala in the previous month has made her the most great person of this decade. I thought that she was a really courageous person."
6487,"Lawyers and judges need to have knowledge and skills to deal with many legal issues. Trainee lawyers and judges might have to solve a life-threatening issues if they are able to be the legal professions. However, I think that those questions are not suitable questions toward trainee lawyers and judges, because this situation is very serious and they will probably lose their power of accurate and clam judgement in that situation. To be sure, the legal professions must have the ability to judge and make the right assessment under any circumstances, but I think that the judgement to legal issues and the threat to life of family are completely different. It seems to enjoy the reactions of examinees. In addition, this question lets examinees to be weighed the importance of life in a balance. That is an unbecoming way for the legal professions to behave. Therefore, no matter how many times I tried to understand the meaning of the question, I cannot get the drift. I thought a crucial choice does not need on a legal examination after considering that question and its main points."
6488,I agree with you. I think Nobel Peace Prize have to change something now. Because I doubt whether winners make a contribution to world peace or not. And there is few person or people who contribute to world peace. So I think it is one of the good idea.
6489,"At first, I like Star Wars very much. So, when I saw the headline, I thought that this news is interesting. And I thought it was only a joke, because such a political movement is impossible in Japan. I think that there are both good point and bad point for this political movement. At first, we can not understand what kind of policy the Ukraine's Internet Party is advocating, and what kind of politics they want to do. When we conform to the story of Star Wars, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are enemies of Jedi Knight and Rebel. In the story, Palpatine was one of the republican members of the Diet, but he have used a stratagem and planned it so that all power of the republic concentrated on himself. After all, he succeeded in overthrowing the republic and he introduced himself as 'Emperor'. Then Galactic Empire was born. The politics by the empire was domination of fear using menace of 'DEATH STAR' and 'STORM TROOPER' .If I were Ukrainian, I would not vote for Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as one of the Star Wars fan. But if the Ukraine's Internet Party that Darth Vader leads proposes a policy which is good for the nation, I may vote for them. In other words, what I want to say is that the most important thing in politic is contents. However, recently the people who don't pay attention to contents of the politics are increasing. The tendency is strongly seen in young people. Actually, my friends who are university students will not know what kind of policy each political party is advocating. I also understand it. But by having seen this news, I became interested the policy of the Internet Party and the history of the party. After I researched, I think I can not trust them, but it is really important for us to be interested in politics in this way. I think this movement is good at the point to let us pay more attention to politics. As we know, 2015 is the year when Star Wars episode 7 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' was shown. The boom of Star Wars was coming all over the world. Of course I also looked forward to the exhibition very much! I have watched the movie twice in theater! Episode 3 of previous work was shown in 2005. For ten years, Star Wars fans have been waiting. The Internet Party might do such a performance for the purpose of getting on this 'Star Wars wave'. In this way, we can visit it from outside, but Ukrainians are serious. Probably disappointment and dissatisfaction of the nations should reach the considerable level because of military pressure of the neighborhood of border from Russia and admission of Crimea in Russia. In such a case, if political party such as internet Party appears, I think a strange situation may be happened. If the person who is not interested in politics or who does not expect for politics vote for this party with the intention of the joke, it is bad democracy. (This is only a possibility to the last). When I think in this way, I could understand the danger of not knowing the politics. I will be 20 years old on the next birthday, and through this news, I realize that it is important to understand the manifesto and way of thinking of parties. By the way, the headline of this news is Chewbacca' arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules. I like Chewie in the movie. Chewie is popular in his cute voice. As a copilot of the millennium falcon and as the fellow of Han Solo, he brought about the excellent scene. But I don't like this Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine. The reason he don't pay is that his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. I was disgusted with this remark. If this is not a political situation, it is a laughable joke. However, this is the election that is most important in democracy. They must collect votes based on rule and without injustice! The point that I was most surprised at in this news is that Lenin statue was transformed to the Darth Vader statue. It is unbelievable that such a permission was granted. And I thought Lenin turned to 'Dark Side'."
6490,"I think Nobel Peace Prize is very prestigious prize. So I can not agree with this prize. When I read this article, I didn't know the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet. So I wondered about this prize. When I read this article politely, I thought they weren't suitable for this prize. When I think of the former winner of this prize, it's very famous and there are a lot of influential people. For example Malala, she is Nobel Peace Prize winner in 2014, she is very famous girl in the world. She did a lot of speeches all over the world and she made people of all over the world moved. So I think she's suitable for this prize. I think Nobel peace prize committee thinks and wants you to decide a winner tightly."
6491,"The world cooperates these days to reduce greenhouse gas to stop the progress of the global warming. Two methods called cap and trade and the baseline credit were adopted in the Kyoto Protocol. This method was concrete and effective left splendid results in Germany and Japan. After Copenhagen meeting of COP15 and Mexican meeting of COP16, developing countries and developed countries set the target of the greenhouse gas reduction and were on agreement afterwards. The world finally became one and became able to solve the issue of global warming that swung between many developed countries which were going to control the emission of the greenhouse gas and developing countries to give priority to economic development. I think that there are many people who insist that global warming is progressing and we must stop it in spite of there being such actions of world nations. They only worry people. We should not sound an alarm bell of the global warming and first of all should check world actions to global warming and think about solutions. Sadly in spite of such a world action, the quantity of carbon dioxide emission continues increasing. The private sectors surely causes the global warming as Bill Gates said. It is difficult to make them reduce the quantity of the CO2 emission of the private sector while interest exists. I think that the government should intervenes in a private sector and make numeric data visible, then concrete ways to reduce emissions of the CO2 of the private sector can be found. I think that to grope for concrete solutions than to criticize the current capitalist system is very constructive. 'A majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies' this article said. It is surely certain that some people have vast property in capitalist society. However, do the Japanese citizens have the impression that more and more people suffering from life because of poverty? I don't have and maybe most of people don't have because social welfare system is established well. Switzerland of the first place on well-being ranking is the same. I think that it becomes a key to get rid of a gap between the poor and the rich to establish social welfare systems well."
6492,"I am agree with you. And I like Star wars, too. This is a serious problem for Ukrainian. The country has a lot of problem. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine should not be permitted. He must not have a qualification about election."
6494,"When I read this article, I was very astonished. Why did you think Chewbacca was arrested? But Chewbacca remained in this article, and I had no relation. It was bad that Chewbacca broke a law. I think even the character of Star Wars has to observe the law. But I think the idea that it's better to disguise itself as the famous character and be watched at election. A decline of the election rate is a problem now in Japan. I think it's also one of countermeasures I elect uniquely, and to raise the interest of the people."
6496,"I disagree with your opinion. First of all, we should not discriminate people by race or religion although we are afraid of terrorism. Whatever the reason, we must not discriminate people. Additionally, if I were Muslim, I would be afraid of being discriminated by his plan. If discrimination is repeated again and again, it would give rise to hatred and advance the cause of terrorism. All in all, I strongly believe that we should be considerate of people of different religion. So, we should prevent terrorism in other reasonable way."
6498,"The problem written by this article is one of the most important problems now at all over the world. The problem argued very intensely in COP21. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one. When establishing a reduction target, a developing nation would consider a supply source of the new energy for growth. I think it can develop into the environment financially well when doing that."
6502,"I can't agree to an idea of Mr. Trump. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical. An ordinary person is in them, too. For example does the person who would like to go to the United States of America to learn cause terrorism? I don't think so. So I can't agree to his opinion."
6504,"Before reading this article, I did not understand the Nobel Prize. I thought, the Nobel Prize has global and absolute worth, and I thought only the person who really contributed to peace can win the Peace Prize. But this news changed my thought. I did not know that Barack Obama wined the Prize in 2009. But I know that the United States still continues intervening in various areas by force of arms and military cost of USA is top in the world. American politicians were sometimes nominated until now. After all The Nobel Prize seems to be strong in the political side. It is natural that the winning boosts winner's influence. So the selection committee should choose winners strictly and carefully. And above all, it is important for winners to take actions as Prize Winners. Separating from the thought of founder is sad. I want the Prize to become 'genuine Peace Prize'."
6505,I am interested in your opinion that Nobel Peace Prize is becoming the thing only for the name. We should reconsider the need of this prize.
6507,"I think that the Nobel Prize should be abolished or that the Nobel Prize should give the person whom world people accept the Nobel Prize, because It is difficult to define contribution to the world peace. Many Nobel Prize winners are criticized by this article metaphorically. However, how much they contribute to world peace in order to say that they deserve the Nobel Prize completely? If the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet could stop all of the terrorism or If Barack Obama did not do bombing in Afghanistan, can they deserve the Nobel Prize completely? Nobody can answer. Those people who got the Nobel Prize contributed to world peace in order not to want the Nobel Prize. Actually they accomplished something which contributed to world peace. Therefore, I think that the Nobel Prize should be abolished or that the Nobel Prize should give the person whom world people accept the Nobel Prize."
6508,"I object to a remark of Mr. cards determinedly. The terrorism of ISIS surely is a thing standing out. The terrorist activity of ISIS including terrorism caused in Paris recently must be prevented. However, Mr.Trump said, 'all Muslims should be forbidden entering USA.' Of course the Americans of Muslim living abroad are included in this. A case that the Muslim who do not participate in terrorism received an assault happened in each place. I want the person with political power to be careful about remark and not to forget that there's the case that human rights are violated by the statement of only one. And we should not forget that the problem is only ISIS of the Muslim."
6509,"The climate change assumes gradually a serious aspect. There is a lot of argument about this problem, and many of countries are coming to grips with it. However, it is taking a great deal of times to improve. Even if some countries make an effort to solve the climate change, it does not mean if other countries do not cooperate to solve together. Nevertheless, I know developing countries need energy sources to be developed their own economy, but we will lose both principal and interest if people will not be able to live on earth by the climate change because of the destruction of an environment. Many countries are inflicting damage to the environment for a profit and expansion of countries. However, the more people inflict damage the environment, the more life of the earth are shortening. Bill Gates said that especially China, the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, but Japan also has to work together to save the earth and our living as one of the developed countries. In addition, it announced that Bill Gates spend two billion dollars of his own wealth on green energy, and he insisted that an individual investors is the very helpful people to solve the problem. It is not a duty, but I hope any investors to fellow him, and I thought it is great that he leads actively from the front to settle of a problem."
6510,"I think that saving girlfriend instead of mother is not crime.Saving girlfriend itself is great thing, even if you can't save your mother.If I am faced with this situation, however , I will save my mother instead of my girlfriend.There is only one mother in the world, but girlfriend isn't only one in the world.If there is crime in this case, it is that you don't understand the importance of your mother.It is also true that father is only one around the world , so you should know your father is great and willing to save him instead of your boyfriend."
6518,"When I read this article, for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. And I feel it is very difficult to understand this problem. I feel that the lawyers and judges have to have many knowledge about strange case. But there are many points that I can not consent to. To begin with, the law which legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones are strange. Originally, people's lives are equal so everyone have tone dealt with equally by the law. So I think it is ridiculous to decide how to deal with this problem. But helping mother have a point in some aspects. There are many girls in the world, but my mother is a only one. So depending on the idea, this way of thinking is possible.But If i faced this situation, I would ask my girlfriend."
6519,"I think China's Ministry of Justice is not right. It is mainly because People's lives are equal. If it was almost impossible to help mother and it was almost possible to help girlfriend, should I go to help mother although both mother and girlfriend would die? It is ridiculous that I miss the life of girlfriend, which I can help and try to help the life of mother, which I cannot help because it is illegal to help girlfriend Human should be treated impartially. It is wrong to compare the life of the person and to give an answer. I doubt Chinese sense of values."
6521,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. And I opposed the Nobel peace prize. I think the Nobel Prize have to be considered carefully and gradually. And I think Nobel Prize have to be the one that people all over the world happily accept. Indeed there is a gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens. But I think it has a very important role .This award will influence on all over the world."
6522,"I am against your opinion. Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us. However, this is an examination question to the last. In other words, a proper answer exists. According to Ministry of Justice, it is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that the person who chose to help the girlfriend is imposed for the crime by what 'Crime of non-action' that is nothing did. Apart from the contents of the problem, I think that it is established as a problem for the time being as far as there is such a proper answer. Still,I can never deny the opinion that this problem is against morality."
6523,"I think it is so difficult to answer this problem so both my mother and girlfriend are valuable persons. But if I need to have this answer, I will try to rescue my mother from a burning building over my girlfriend. Certainly, many people may criticize me for sacrificing my girlfriend but I think it is the best idea which has a possibility to be able to save both lives. Naturally my mother is older and weaker than my girlfriend so the person who needs to help is my mother. Even if it is an all-or-nothing contest, I want to select the means which do not compare my mother with my girlfriend but sacrifice nobody. If I answer this idea, I cannot pass the National Judicial Exam because I don't choose either woman. But I don't think if someone rescues his girlfriend over his mother, the action is a crime. That is because there are many ways of thinking who should be rescue and we don't know which way is right. Though in Edo era, the idea that we should treat our parents respectfully than any other person was more deep-rooted than now, nowadays I think the idea that all people are treated equally generally become to spread. So whichever woman you choose, it is true. The important thing is that you have enough consideration to both women."
6524,"We should understand the criteria of Nobel Peace Prize again.Nobel wanted it work for disarmament and against militarism, and build a peace movement.In this article, many inappropriate example of Nobel Peace Prize are showed. Neither of them led the world to peace.Before giving them Nobel Prize,we must consider if they brought peace, of course it is not short term one.As other Nobel Prizes have, Peace Prize should also have dignity."
6525,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. Because I have never watched Star Wars. I did not know any character of name. So it is very difficult for me to understand. It is very interesting. But we have to consider this problem seriously."
6526,"I totally disagree with your idea. If I were an American, I disagree with Donald J. Trump. One reason is that his suggestion seems to ensure at a glance the security of the people, but, actually, is the action that may make Muslims of the world enemies. The Islamic nation is different from Muslims. His proposal regard the whole Muslims as the Islamic nation. The other reason is that to abolish the visa lottery make America conservative. The probability to win visa lottery is very low. Without visa lottery, America would become exclusive. America should be melting pot and free."
6527,"As the sentence of this article, Henry Kissinger won the Nobel peace prize in 1973 despite the fact the war went on for another two years and the fact that, he was 'implicated in propping up violent right-wing regimes in South America as well as bombing Cambodia'. Hitler was nominated in 1939 and Stalin in 1945 and 1948. As Moreton ponders, 'just how noble is the Nobel Peace Prize?' One has to wonder. As those, it seems to be questionable that what is a standard yardstick. In every year, only one person win the Nobel peace prize all over the world. The greatest best person, group which is contributed to a cross-national friendly relationship, reduction, the abolition of armaments and the promotion of the peace conference can get this prominent prize. In this view, Hitler and Stalin can win the Nobel Peace Prize. Because, each person do not like war. And, they do them best not to happen war. But many people now think that they like to happen war to get more power. In fact, they do many bad things. For example, Hitler contained an Arab in Auschwitz and abused them. This is a very brutal thing and is not a permissible thing. But he concentrate on solving the problem among many western countries and America. So, we should look at Henry Kissinger, Hitler and Stalin at another view. We often think with many people's opinion. But, sometimes, We have to research many things about what is thought to be right. If we look at one things with another suspect, We will find new thing. This is very important thing. By the way, Malala won Nobel peace prize in 2015. Malala appeals about the right of a woman and child.. In addition, she goes for antiwar activity. We should follow her."
6528,"I agree with the idea that capitalist, like Bill Gates, try to make environment better positively. There are many problems like not only global warming but also the shortage of resources. For thousands of years, the population of the world increased gradually. Then, in the middle nineteenth century, the world's population started to rise rapidly. In the 100 years between 1830 and 1930, the population of the world grew from 1 billion to 2 billion people. By 1960, just thirty years later, the world's population had hit 3 billion. Fifteen years later, the population reached 4 billion. Then, a mere eleven years later, there are 5 billion people on earth. In 1999, we passed the 6 billion mark. Today, the world's population grows by 76 million people every year. By the year 2050, researchers predict that the population of the world will be 9.1 billion. Does the earth have the natural resources to support this many people? Unfortunately, the answer tooth's question depends on information we do not have. For example, we do not know how people will choose to live in the future. We do not know what their standard of living will be. We also do not know what new technologies will be available in future. We do know that the Earth's natural resources are limited. Fresh water, for example, is crucial for health and food production. However, more than 97% of the water Earth is salt water, which is poisonous to both people and crops. Only 3% of the water on Earth is fresh water, and three quarters of that fresh water is frozen at the North and South Poles. Today, the demand for fresh is greater than the supply in roughly eighty countries around the world. By 2025, scientists predict that forty eight countries will have chronic shortages of water. At present, desalinization, or the removal of salt from salt water, is not a solution to the shortage of fresh water. Intakes a lot of energy to remove the salt from ocean water, and that makes the desalinization process very expensive. The amount of land we can use to produce food is also limited. Today, roughly 11% of the land on Earth can be used for crops, while another 20% is available for raising animals. Each year, however, more this land is lost as cities grow and roads stretch across the land. In addition, over cultivation has already damaged an amount of farmland equal to the size of the United States and Canada combined. It is impossible to increase the amount of farmland, but only a little. Some farmland can be more productive if people start using different farming methods, but this will not increase worldwide production very much. Clean air is another important natural resource. However, it too is Threatened by the growing population. The average person today puts about 1.1 metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. Most of it comes from burning fossil fuels, gasoline, coal, oil, wood, and natural gas. Scientist say that the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is already 18% higher than it was in 1960. What effect would 3 billion more people have on the air we breathe? While we have many different sources of energy, there is a limited supply of many of them. Today, most of the world's energy comes from three nonrenewable resources, petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Three quarters of this energy is used by developed countries. As the standard of living goes up in other countries, so will the demand for the energy. Some scientists predict that if everyone in the world lived like an American, our fossil fuel supply would last for just fifteen more years. Clearly, the number of people that the Earth can support in the future will depend on many things. The Earth may be able to support 9 billion people, but what will their standard of living be? And what effect will all these people have on the environment? In this situation, each people should do his best to protect our environment and Capitalist's action can be key to achieve this purpose especially, I think."
6529,"I think that capitalism cannot save us from climate change. I think of this theme these days and we have to think about this problem. I think that capitalism is too much in one sense. First, in capitalism, to provide anything and to use anything last forever and the term 'Mottainai' was disregarded as nonsense. And capitalism was not sustainable and company must earn money and the result was decided by the money one earned. All the value was judged according to money. This pattern of capitalism always lead to the destruction of nature. To get wood and the place for cultivating land, people cut the forest and the evolution of modern world was connected with the destruction of nature. Capitalism break the traditional value and disregard this as cheap. Mass consumption is regarded as the value. Commodity was thrown away if it don't work well. People who live in modern world don't repair and don't have the thought to use anything over and over again. This is connected to the destruction of nature. Because this cause the mass consumption The more People uses the money, the company can get more money and this is the characteristic of capitalism. I think that nature and capitalism cannot coexist. . So let's look at the meaning of capitalism. ' an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means' It just illustrates the system. But we have to think abut the capitalism. Does capitalism made people happier? Are there no people who cry by the problem of money? So now is the time to use Mottainai to pass on beautiful earth to next generation and create a beautiful world."
6531,"Me too! I agree with you. I have never watched Star Wars, so I can hardly understand about this incident and believe this is real event when I read this article at first."
6532,I agree with your idea. The member of its selection committee should research the candidate's career and pay attention to faults and risk of candidates and take time as long as possible until they give candidates the Nobel Prize. I think in such way more appropriate person would be selected.
6533,"Donald J. Trump gets attention by his extreme statement. It is able to give a stimulus to people, but his speech produces nothing. His speech is so similar to child's struggling. I thought it is no longer a speech. It is just a performance. I often watch him and his extreme statement on TV, and I feel displeased every time I see him and I hear the news about him. His speech and behavior are full of inconsistencies. His statements are not be based on fact or data, so he is not worth to trust. It is simpleminded that he makes statements without thinking. If he will be the President of the US, I experience an anxiety to the international situation, and I will be probably disappointed in the US. I cannot understand why many people in the US support this crazy candidate, and I do not want to understand his real intention of violent language. He says something which is likely to be misunderstood, and many people get hurt by his language. A strong assertion is sometimes needed in the politics, but it is not an appropriate act that a politician which is should protect citizens from harm by rights discriminates them. Is it really a right way that this man becomes the leader of the US? The US is called 'melting pot of different ethnic groups.' To prove that, the leader should accept all people in the US and people who want to migrate to the US. Nevertheless, this time, he discriminated based on religion. Of course, in spite of that Muslim people have the right to live in the US, why this cruel tyrant decides their destiny. That is the same as Adolf Hitler. However, there might be any reasons that he is being backed up by many of American citizens. I have many incomprehensible points toward him,but I am genuinely interested in the prospect of a presidential election in this year. I will pay attention to the battle of Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton."
6534,"At first, I can't understand this article well. This article was a little difficult for me to understand.I'll write about some points picked up from this article. First, I'm going to talk about the statement of Bill Gates. I found that I agree with him, and also disagree with him. The point that I agree is that a substantial carbon tax may encourage innovators or energy buyers to start working for carbon dioxide emission reduction. He said,' Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch.' This may be right. For sure, a carbon dioxide emission is still big. So imposing a new tax on CO₂ emission can be an effective way to decrease it. On the other hand, the point I disagree is that the problem of CO₂ emission should be solved in the rich countries. Of course, developed countries are responsible for the climate problems. That is the fact we cannot doubt. But, only developed countries can't solve the problems. They should be tackled all over the world. The example is measures to illegal destruction of forests in the Amazon. In this way, there are problems which can't be solved in only rich countries. Second, I'm going to talk about the capitalism. This article said the capitalism is criticized by two sources, Bill Gates and a new survey showing that the public have doubts about capitalism as well. The former did from the viewpoint of environmental protection and the latter did from the viewpoint of economy in the world. I described the former in previous paragraph. So I think about the latter. In this capitalistic economy, in fact, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. This phenomenon is to be generated by all means in the capitalistic world. But the poor isn't necessarily continuing to be poor. The poor have a chance to be rich. To do so, the poor will have to be educated more. The rich have to support the system the poor get proper education. Then, I think the compliant about the capitalism will decrease. This article mentioned two attack for capitalism. It is very difficult to consider what the capitalism should be. Is the capitalism good for us,or bad for us? I think the capitalism is good, but should be improved. From this article, the compliant was appeared, so we should tackle to make capitalism better."
6535,"When I read this article first time, I was surprised that such a difficult and controversy question like choosing his mother's or girlfriend's life was included in the National Judicial Exam in China. However, I strongly believe that the question was very nice and worth question in that test. There are two reasons for my idea. First, questions that the public cannot decide only one right answer exist a lot in the world. If future judges and lawyers pass the test, they are obliged to deal with questions that we cannot decide one right answer. Second, although the question like choosing mother or girlfriend's life does not have only one right answer, judges and lawyers should hear and understand all answers. In addition, they judge that something is good or bad just only based on laws and their conscience. Next, I would like to talk about the rightness of the answer of the question. China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think this answer is out of date. Modern societies' paradigm is based on egalitarianism. According to legal equality, it is not forgiven for a son not only to be prior his mother's life to his girlfriend's life but also to be prior his girlfriend's life to his mother's life. Therefore, it is ridiculous that his not to rescue his mother from a deadly fire before others, including his relatives and loved ones, amounts to a criminal failure to act. As a result, I think it is natural that he is not guilty. By the way, the writer told us that the question included in the aspect of sexual discrimination. I strongly agree with this idea because the test assumes the test-takers are male as the writer told. Of course, should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Finally, I would like to talk about my choice for this question. Apart from legal reasons, I am prior to my mother's life basically. However, if I decide to marry my girlfriend, I rescue my girlfriend before my mother. The reason is the importance of my following life. I believe that my fiancé is more important than my mother for my following life."
6536,"I thought that the approval rating of Mr.Trump fell, too. I was surprised that an approval rating of Mr. Trump did not fall. However, it is thought that there is the proper reason why an approval rating of Mr. Trump does not decline. Probably, as for it, I think, 'an Establishmentarian in the United States says that an approval rating of Mr. Trump declines'. It may be said that a remark of those Establishment strengthen support from Trump's support layer that has an antipathy to them to Mr.Trump. Actually, in the public opinion poll to Republican Party substrate,the yes and no to remark in itself competes, and there are the unfavorable feelings for Muslim in itself in the situation shared widely. These are to be easily understood if the camp carries out a public opinion poll beforehand. In other words, it can be probably said that the case that the White House and domestic and foreign Establishmentarian expressed concern about this anti-Muslim remark is the the result as planned for Mr. Trump who aims at the victory in Republican Party primary election. Soon after having started an electoral campaign in a good manner as for Mr.Trump, there was the low approval rating of Mr. Trump compared to other candidates and nobody thought that Mr. Trump built the superiority like the present. But afterwards,the result that he took a substrate against Establishment in effectively By showing a hostility posture for the Establishment is connected in the present superiority.These are the class of qualified voters dug up by an active action of Mr.Trump. Mr. Trump has already obtained around 30% of the Republican Party substrate in strong form and can win by republican nomination competition if he obtain another 20%.I want to learn his successful idea and aggressiveness using adverse circumstances by all means."
6537,"I think that the only people who contribute to the world 'real' peace strongly should receive the Novel Peace Prize. I believe that each countries' leader had better proceed disarmament all over the world. If someone bring the world peace violently, violence always makes hate, at the end, the peace collapse. Alfred Nobel, the founder of the Nobel Prize, the inventor of dynamite who made his fortune as an arms manufacturer, clearly hoped to give the prize to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement. Therefore, the Nobel Peace Prize is the prize which should be given to people working for disarmament and against militarism, and who were building a peace movement."
6538,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised that 'joke' candidates like Chewie and Emperor Palpatine exist in official elections. In that time, I am angry with the candidates because it is ridiculous that someone runs for officials as a joke. However, I realize that not only 'non-joke' candidates but also 'joke' candidates compose of liberal societies. As you know, such 'joke' candidates like Dr. Nakamatsu also exist in Japan. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. If we are based on their idea, not only 'non-joke' candidates but also 'joke' candidates are good and free. Meanwhile, in full-grown democratic societies, such 'joke' candidates cannot be elected to officials because citizens understand that it is not well for them to elect 'joke' candidates to officials. By the way, I have never seen 'Star Wars' before. So, I have pain to read this article. The other day, the latest 'Star Wars' series movie was released and the series movies are in the spotlight. Since 'Star Wars' series movies are told a masterpiece by many movie fans, I would like to see 'Star Wars' in my spring break!"
6539,"I believe that developed countries' government had better try to shift economic fabric of society without fossil fuels little by little. However, I think we must try to shift non-carbon life in order to not solve global warming but keep the level of our life for a long time. The leaders of developed countries these days realize that global warming are big problem. On the other hand, the leaders have not made sufficient solutions for stopping global warming. However, is global warming really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like 'Cheer up!' or 'Go for it' does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. Therefore, although global warming is regarded as just evil thing by many people in modern society, I strongly believe that global warming has both aspects of good and bad. By the way, fossil fuels will dry up soon. So, we must try to shift little by little non-carbon life without fossil fuels. It is essential for us to use energy. If fossil fuels dried up, we could not keep the level of our life. In that time, in order to keep the level of our life, we must progress the technology of green energy. In conclusion, global warming has both aspects of good and bad. Also, we must progress the technology of green energy in order to keep the level of our life for a long time."
6540,"When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised that the person who has such an extreme claim becomes presidential candidate. Although Donald J Trump insists to block all Muslims from entering the United States, I strongly think that his insistence makes the U.S. un-American because the U.S. consist of immigrants from Europe originally. Therefore, his insistence that the U.S. blocks all Muslims is not admitted. Moreover, we should strongly criticize his statement which has no basis about Paris. He always must speak with a sense of responsibility as presidential candidate of the U.S."
6541,"I agree with your idea. As you said, the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lacking in persuasiveness. If China's Ministry of Justice mentioned enough reasons, this question cannot become a question, because people's lives are equal. If I faced such situation, I would try to help the both."
6542,"This news uses many metaphors and it make me interested in it. The arrest of Chewbacca is funny one, but in fact Ukraine has many problems.The local elections were marked by traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals and so on.Now Star Wars is boomed again ,but we should look into real problems seriously."
6543,"When I heard of the news, I was shocked and I think how he dare say such a stupid thing. Of course, some terrorists are Muslim and I can't deny that people have negative feeling about Muslim. But religion and the politics is no related and there are many good Muslims who are loyal to their god. In japan, the problem of racism was serious problem. In japan, one racism group shouted hate speech against primary school at Kyoto and broke its facility. They maintained that this primary school used Public Park as their ground illegally and hate speech is freedom of speech and we did right thing. In fact, the primary school used Public Park as their playing ground. It seemed illegal, but primary school talked with neighbors over and over again and they got allowance to use Public Park as their playground. After the some trials, this group was sentenced to guilty. I read the books about this problem and I wondered why some people become Racist. To be on the part of racist, the argument that this is freedom of speech. Is partly right. But I don't think so. Because this kind of speech was not saved by constitution. To be chosen as the president of United States of America, he wanted to be focused and he wanted to get some strange people's votes. But I don't think these reasons justify his hate speech and this must be shame. If we do the policy as he says, America is no longer the country of freedom and freedom will pass away. But I thanks his saying. Because i noticed that he must not be the president of the United States of America and we must choose other person, so I thank him. Of course, this is the sarcasm."
6544,"Surely in Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics!!! This case is similar to the candidacy of dozen Vader.However, it is the story that the people who have been elected only with popularity often damage the politics. Because it cannot happen, I think that the running people have to acquire knowledge about politics and manner well..."
6545,"I disagree with you in that you think that if developed countries start to tackle the problem of CO₂ emission, the climate problems will be solved. Of course, developed countries should try to solve them, like decreasing CO₂ emission. But that only doesn't makes it possible to solve them. The climate problems are the world's problems. So they should be tackled all over the world. For example, the illegal deforestation has happened in the Amazon too often. Only developed countries can't cope with such a thing."
6546,"I object to a remark of Mr. Trump determinedly. The terrorism of ISIS surely is a thing standing out. The terrorist activity of ISIS including terrorism caused in Paris recently must be prevented. However, Mr.Trump said, 'all Muslims should be forbidden entering USA.' Of course the Americans of Muslim living abroad are included in this. A case that the Muslim who do not participate in terrorism received an assault happened in each place. I want the person with political power to be careful about remark and not to forget that there's the case that human rights are violated by the statement of only one. And we should not forget that the problem is only ISIS of the Muslim."
6547,"There is intervention of police for this incident, but there are many nuisances that we have not pick up as violations. Smoking is one of these problems, I think. I believe smoking in the prohibited area should be banned in public places. Recently, several countries have restricted the areas in which people may smoke. Scientist agree that smoking is dangerous. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. A more strict ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Indeed, there may be little relationship between this incident and smoking, however, I think we need to grasp this incident more widely on this occasion."
6548,"I somewhat agree with Bill Gates.Now the richer the countries are, the more they consume energy sources.Capitarism itself is good thing.Many countries include Japan introduce capitarism.On the other hand ,it can make earth environment go worse.Discharging Carbon Dioxide is typical examle.In China , so many cars are used for transportation.It promote environmental problems.To stop climate change, rich countries must reduce CO2 emissions and willing to introduce green energy."
6549,"I strongly agree with this idea. I also believe the problem which choose his girlfriend's life or his mother's life doesn't have only one right answer. People's lives are equal. Therefore, we cannot decide it. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to determine. I cannot comprehend that people in China are legally forced saving their parents over other relatives and loved ones. Moreover, you said, 'the best way is saving all of them, so we have to think this way every time.' I think that this idea is the perfect answer to the ultimate question."
6550,I strongly agree with you. Man in power like Bill Gates has influence on society.Their opinions can move many people in right directions to make green environment.Sometimes This kind of influence is bigger than one nations opinion.
6552,"I disagree with your idea because I believe that not only 'non-joke' candidates but also 'joke' candidates compose of liberal societies. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. When our politics are based on their idea, not only 'non-joke' candidates but also 'joke' candidates are good and free. However, I respect you. You always try to listen to others carefully and take in the idea which you don't have from others. I would like to imitate you and feel the pleasure of studying all together in the class."
6553,"I agree with this idea. Obviously, he always must speak with a sense of responsibility as presidential candidate of the U.S. In addition, we must not regard Muslims as Terrorists. Therefore, it is not admitted to block all Muslims from entering the United States naturally."
6555,"Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigration may not be accepted in public , but his opinion is somewhat right idea.Trump is concerned about Islam's terrorism.Now Islamic States attacks many people include nations, they also attack innocent people.United States is one of main target of IS and if US accept immigrants from Muslim , they can cause terrorism.I don't completely agree with Trump's plan, but we should be careful not to be involved in matters such as terrorism."
6556,"I disagree with you. Even if this remark is for political reason, his extreme opinion can't be accepted in society.Only minor percentage of conservative people follow him.this plan comes from his lack of awareness."
6557,"I agree with your idea. Certainly, the only people who contribute to the world 'real' peace strongly should receive the Novel Peace Prize. I believe that the Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded for accomplished peace. 'I hope that the Nobel Peace Prize bring us the peace.' This is great!!! I was moved when I read the comment."
6558,"I don't agree with your idea. Precisely, is global warming including CO2 emission really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like 'Cheer up!' or 'Go for it' does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. I strongly believe that global warming has both aspects of good and bad."
6559,"I agree with your opinion. Determining criteria of Nobel Peace Prize is necessary to praise right person.If bad person like Hitler was elected to Nobel Prize, dignity of this award would lessen."
6560,"First time I read this story, I didn't understand what this whole news was about. Because of the many nouns I have never seen like Chewbacca, Wookiee, Odessa,but after I looked up these words I soon understood it. At first, I thought 'A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because of breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day' and the face that he was campaigning for 'Darth Vader' was funny. And the fact that he told the local reporters 'he had no way to pay the fine because his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet' made it even funnier. I am sure that the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world too, however IT IS NO JOKING MATTER FOR MANY UKRAINIANS. It is natural that they have to be serious about the politics, since they have a lot of problems to solve like Crimean region affairs. About the election, I think it should be kept clean with no-dirty tactics so that Ukrainian government can introduce the 'new kind of politics'. Also in the article it says that there was a related news that a statue of Lenin was transformed by Ukrainian artists last week. And it is because of the law banning any public statues of its communist past. As I said I thought it was funny, but its not. I do not understand why they are trying to mix the politics with funny things. It should be separated and never should get mixed. I have totally the same opinion with Borovik. It is beyond my understanding and I am like what is wrong with people these days about those things."
6561,"In fact, I thought that this Novel Peace Prize should be backed from Mr.Obama immediately at first, but now, it is odd to do that, I realized. Indeed, Mr.Obama's action, especially the aerial bombing, is very radical and unbelievable considering his speech. It is not too much to say he is a bloody liar. However, it is an indisputable fact that he made a speech named 'a world without nuclear weapons', which brought his award, too. Its achievement itself must be unchanged even if he complicity to huge war. In addition, if he need to return this Nobel Prize, it is the mistake of Nobel Committee, not Mr.Obama's. It is to show that the committee should have awarded Nobel Prize more carefully, but they didn't. Because of these two reasons, I think Mr.Obama do not have to return his prize and I disagree with you."
6562,"I think Mr.Obama do not have to return his Novel Peace Prize to Novel committee, because that prize is to magnify the honer to a good impact of his speech, 'A world without nuclear weapons' and there is no direct relationship between this prize and his aerial bombing. These two facts should be considered separately and this is only a moral problem."
6563,"Oh no! I should have written 'A world without nuclear weapons', but I wrote 'a world without nuclear weapons'. Next time, I will take care about, sorry."
6564,"Surely it was after a man dressed as 'Chewbacca' broke legislation that forbids campaign on Election Day that he arrested in Ukraine. This is a serious matter and a crime. We must obey the law of your own nation. He should be judged and may insult the people who live in Odessa. And his action may insult and disturb democratic politics and election. However, I was surprised in this news when I read this article for the first time. Saying in other words, I was confused and can't understand this news. Because the character of very very popular movie among people all over the world, Star Wars took part in the election, did a political campaign and made a political party. I feel liberty in Ukraine. I was amazed these humor. If the famous character of Japanese animation or movie do a political campaign in Japan, I think he/she or they is criticized by conservative people. For instance, I feel more humorous in a president's speech of USA than a prime minister's speech of Japan. I think it is wonderful thing to permit this humor. So I think difference of culture and tolerance of nation when I read this article."
6565,"I agree with you. I wonder if the voters really thought of what the candidate with a well-known character name will do after winning the election. It seems people just chose him because his name is famous and funny. There might be some people electing him with other reasons. However, it is just unclear. To make it fair, I think nobody should not use character names in elections."
6566,"'Immigrants should be accepted.', this opinion seemed to be common sense, buts it really true? Indeed, it is a fact that immigrants do not tend to be accepted and many countries in the world try to eager to give permission for them even if they are in aware of the danger, so the country which hates to accept them can be thought as uncooperative country. However, it is true that there are a lot of differences between immigrants and natives in terms of religion, traditional, culture, language, custom, climate, and so on, so there are many risks -rising of the criminal rate, importing the infection that natives vulnerable to, etc... Therefore, Immigration regulations may be good choice if the government consider the native national's safe as the most important thing. I did not know what to conclude about it, but I think the government should take care about this fact very much."
6567,"I cannot agree with your opinion. I understand that the present situation in Tunisia is terrible, but it is obvious that Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet is trying their best to maintain peace. Probably we cannot see an expected outcome for now, but I believe their actions are the first step for Tunisia to build up its own democracy. I think Nobel Peace Prize does not have to go to people who change situations dramatically. Gradual change should be respected."
6568,"I agree with you. When I read this article for the first time, I didn't still watch Star Wars. I can't understand the terms of Star Wars, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' and so on. I watched Star Wars recently. I can understand the terms now. So I think this article is lack of consideration for people who never watch Star Wars."
6569,"I think that the United States is a multi ethnic nation, too, but I disagree with you. Immigration problem is not so simple than we think and should not be decided with ease. In addition, there is very strong hostility between the United States and a part of Muslim. If the U.S. accept them easily, American who hates Muslim can attack these immigrants and the decision may cause but effect for both of them. Therefore the U.S. perhaps cannot accept immigrants easily."
6571,"I disagree with Trump's banning Muslim immigrations. USA's decision may make possibilities that the other countries refuse to receive immigrations. USA is known as a country that has liberty ideology and that receive many immigrants from all over the world .Therefore Their decision to reject immigrants may cause the situation that many countries begin to hesitate to receive immigrants. I think USA should be the model of liberty and diversity. I give some concrete plans to prevent terrorism.When some big games are held ,many policemen should check people carefully. Watching cameras should be set many places and police keeps on watching. Not all Muslim immigrants are dangerous people. We tend to assume Muslims to be scary thanks to terrorism but all Muslim followers do not have dangerous Islamic idea. I heard that almost all of them hate it There are some people who really want to run away from their own countries to USA. If USA decide to ban all Muslim immigration, Muslims who are good-natured will be persecuted and they will be treated awfully. In addition to these points , they will not be able to live peacefully because of the dangerous same family .This is how it is important for us to recognize the difference between fundamentalists and the others."
6573,"I sympathize with your opinion. When I read this article, I was shocked. I think that people who awarded the Nobel Peace Prize are very great person. In my thought, Hitler is notorious war criminal. So I was very surprised. But history repeats itself. We should think about peace."
6574,"I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I agree with your idea that this social system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society. In this society, poor person is poor more and more, and the rich person becomes richer and richer. However, I think it is good for the world that some capitalists like Bill Gates spend money for the human. It is reason that the money gathers to a rich person because a rich person turns the economy. Therefore I am agreeable in private sectors."
6575,"I think the Nobel peace prize is most important to protect world's peace. It is true that prize winners did bad thing. However The action which they did is much bigger than bad action they did. For example I'll talk about Barack Obama. Barack Obama has fought and passed significant legislation to promote a nuclear free world and has communicated from the United States to other many countries. As well as he has worked to amend the relationship between the Middle East and the West. The only reason why many people think he should not have won is because the media speaks only about huge and noticeable stories or about wars. And many people do not even realize all things he has done to get rid of the gaps between our wounded world. From directing refugee funds, to creating Special Envoys to further assist Middle Eastern countries, to easing restrictions on Cuba as well as working with them for democratic reform so that they can mend their relationship with the world as well, to helping ensure peaceful and fair deals by Kenya and Somalia to work together in rightfully trying pirates, worked to better promote an end to genocide in Darfur, a fight against poverty throughout the world while providing tools to prosperity for many African and emerging countries (which will of course add to and improve the world economy), he worked to withdraw our country from Iraq knowing it would help ease tensions between the United States and the Middle East, outlined and promoted ideas to deal with the Israeli and Palestinian conflict, and he did indeed create a new climate in the air which was acknowledged by many world leaders who truly felt that the President had created an entirely new atmosphere in the world for dealing with problems. As a senator he has proposed plans to control the world's supply of weapons as well as biological weapons. He bravely stood up in public right in Hamas to argue that they must relieve themselves of all hostilities and deal with Israel pragmatically. He has amendments in order to create a plan for comprehensive immigration and ease tensions between countries. He has also fought for transparency of foreign aid and federal funds to fight for a more honest and less corrupt world. I think that most people knows about a few things of these things. Take these things into consideration ,and you can understand the Nobel Peace Prize winners are honorable people."
6576,"I am of the opinion that contrary to Nobel's will, Nobel Peace Prize is a founder, the award is not intended to be respecting the peace. Some of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, sometimes took the action that I do not think only to have promoted the war, there is irony also referred to as 'Do not to be referred to as the Nobel War Prize rather than the Nobel Peace Prize.' . It said that there is also the side of the political appeal by Norwegian diplomacy. That Nobel Prize can not be denied that there is a side that has been exploited as a political tool.Award to the person who has been a political prisoner in his native has also caused a strong opposition from concerned governments. In this way the Nobel Peace Prize is sometimes produce a new confrontation."
6577,I agree with your opinion. They lacked an important viewpoint of the equality of human life for this examination of China. They who made this examination should think about ethics once again. I think the true answer to this question should be logically explanation about equality of the life and this question was strange to ignore the ethic.
6578,"Global Climate Change is not a climatic concern, but an economic issue. By creating conditions that diminish profit in developed countries, business capital will migrate to areas of the world that international consensus determines to be in need of economic development. Although the notion of anthropomorphic climate change has been widely dismissed by serious, non-politically funded entities, the push to limit the ability to produce a product in developed countries will continue and expand under the guise of international law. Those who actually believe in the nonsensical idea espoused by Bill Gates are part of the United States. They also are willing and unwilling participants in Global Economic Change, which is the actual agenda of this political and economic movement."
6579,"I am of the opinion that we should create energy by nuclear fusion reactor of the next generation. I am sure that with this technology we can also solve the problem of climate change that Bill Gates worried.Fusion reactor is a type of nuclear reactors under development, those utilizing a nuclear fusion reaction. Practical use in the second half of the 21st century is one of the emerging technologies that are expected. As the fuel of nuclear fusion, use the deuterium and tritium is the isotope of flammable hydrogen by lightly. When fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium, you can helium and neutrons. In this case, than the sum of the weight of the previous reaction deuterium and tritium, lighter is more of the total weight of helium and neutrons were able after the reaction, this lightly became minute of energy is being released. In response, enormous energy is generated from a small amount of fuel, for example, 1 grams of deuterium - You can obtain the corresponding energy to petroleum from tritium fuel equivalent to that of one of the tank truck (about 8 tons). Fusion reactor technology I think some people are worried that not dangerous. But fusion reactor is safe. In the reactor, which is currently operating, it makes use of the nuclear fission reaction. In nuclear fission, and power generation energy heavy atomic nuclei such as uranium and plutonium occurs when you divide the light nuclei to absorb the neutrons is taken out in a nuclear reactor. In addition to this so that safety' is ensured, there are two further advantages. Deuterium which is a raw material of nuclear fusion in one eye There are many in the sea. Therefore it is not worried about the resource is depleted. It is still good for the environment. In the process of power generation, it does not produce carbon dioxide that causes global warming. High-level radioactive waste is not generated."
6580,"I agree with your opinion. When I was a school girl, I lived in Nagoya. And just that time, COP10 was held in Nagoya, we participate in the gathering. So I experienced such thing, after that , I am interested in environmental problems. So I am very worried about environmental problems, and now global warming is surely moving up to worst direction. We ,all over the world not only unit of nation but also unit of the nation and especially the nation who live in industrially developed nation , should make an effort to reduce CO2. Therefore famous people like Bill Gates maintain such thing will affect our life and change our future."
6582,"Surely, Donald Trump is famous and getting popular in America, you know. But as for me, his opinion is never accepted. First, his remark is too radical. He criticizes another candidate and the conventional president intensely. Certainly, a president to work as is better than a president doing nothing, but I cannot trust what he will do. He said not to accept the entry of the Muslim in America. This will deny all the Muslim. Of course, all Muslim cannot be too radical and violent. I have a friend of the Muslim from Indonesia, and she said most of Muslim expect peace and it is the Allah's wish not a fight. Malala Yousafzai also criticized him. She said Trump's remark will bring terrorists newly. She also said you must not criticize all the Muslim to stop terrorism and high quality education is necessary if you want to end terrorism. I sympathized it very much. To bring up a feeling of morality and ethic is very effective to end terrorism, I think. But now in The Middle East, the right children receive education is not guaranteed yet. Malala appealed for it, you know. So other countries such as developed countries should help them so that the right is guaranteed, I think."
6584,"I think that 'joke' candidates are not good method to use for democracy. Public trust is the basis of politics, so election should be sacredness. This is an issue which affects politics. Certainly, sensible citizens would not vote such a candidate, but it will destroy the atmosphere. Especially, in a region where a election system still needs polishing, it must not be permitted. As a real event, in this news story, 'joke' candidate was winning. In Japan, there are some celebrity politicians and they run for an election of the members of the House of Councilors to be a figurehead who attracts the support for their political party. Some of them live up to citizens' expectations, on the other hands, some of them give rise to problem behavior. It can be related to an unfair estimation of political party. Thus, I think that 'joke' candidates are not good for democracy. In addition to this issue, there is another issue that Ukraine is still under the control of Russia. Even though a wave of demonstrations, the Euromaidan revolution, happened in 2014, Ukraine has never turned into a real democratic country. Then traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals still have been used. If Ukraine seriously wants to get out of the control by Russia and become an independent country as a democratic one, Ukraine should begin to reflect its nations' opinions. Clearly, changing traditional methods of politics is not easy, so at least the government should listen to public opinions. Speaking of democracy, it is eminent for politicians to consider what welfare and needs people want the government to make meet. As a result, I believe that using 'joke' candidates is inappropriate way to make a good flow of politics. Also, I think that Ukraine ought to see other countries in the world as many of them have become democratic since globalization has developed in the recent decades and that it is important to consider better way to be democratic by leaning what it should do or not do from the previous revolution."
6585,"I was very surprised to read that the question, 'Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire', I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. Of course 'Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum.' But, saving only mother from a deadly fire is not correct option I think. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. And, I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it. Probably, it based on idea of Confucianism. It thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family. As for making much of parents, this idea is great I think. But this question is not suited for in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test. People's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. Chinese thinking is old, therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date If I encounter this situation, what I should do? I do not know.Well, I do not have girlfriend so this question may not relation to me."
6586,"I disagree with his plan to ban Muslim immigration and to be a president. I think his plan is kind of racist. Not all Muslim has radical belief like people who conducted terrorism. It is only a part of all Muslim. Furthermore, the United States of America has various race in the country, so it should not ban people from entering into country because of religion. I don't want him to be a president of America because of his radical thinking. I think he should change his mind."
6587,"I have a question about Nobel Peace Prize. What standard the recipient of the prize s selected by the organization.In the case of Obama, I don't understand why he was given the Nobel Peace Prize. Nobel Peace Prize is given a man who do his best to keep a peace. He did only announced the two times abolitions of nuclear. From the beginning ,USA, surely any countries, should have had no nuclear. And now the nation continue to attend wars. I think his work don't reach the accomplishment of the prize. However,I think it is difficult for any one to achieve international peace. Human being have their own views each person. I think it is the origin of wars. Although Japan looks peace ,for example, In your family during holidays some want to stay at home and spend a slow time. Other want to go anywhere. Here difficult opinions are born. This is also ,but small, a war. In such a dispute if either may be respect the opinion of the other, it is better.However, when benefits involved in the conflict, we will be adamant in one's opinion, otherwise we lose. Then, we try to force the view with weapon. children call on other with cry. Adult call on other with violence. War is same as that. We can not eliminate those conflicts whereas we need to walk the road to peace that it is to understand each other."
6588,"This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. But after I read this news article , I noticed that I was interested in this news article. In this news , there are sentence that 'Bill Gates, has said that the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels' and ' Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Since World War II, US-government R&amp;D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. The private sector is in general inept. The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else.' I agree with his idea. There many problems like not only global warming but also shortage of resource. We should solve this problem, I think."
6589,"I agree with your opinion. This test made in China is very strange and terrible, because the question 'Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire' means to compare the value of one's life. I think that we should not do such a thing, and this test 'Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire' made the Chinese to do such a thing. So I think this test is strange and terrible. Then, I wish that Chinese have different way from this test to think about human's life, at first. After that I want to think this problem how to treat a life of human any more from now on.And we should think that how to spread one's mind or thinking to other people who has different opinions. It is always difficult thing, I think. But I want to exchange our opinion with people who has different opinions and foreigners more!"
6590,"I can't agree with Trump. For sure, he focused America's attention on the need to secure our borders as Cruz said. But I think Trump's proposal was a little out of line. Blocking all Muslims from entering the United States is not good way to protect America from the fears of terrorism. All people who want to immigrate dose not have radicals thought. Not blocking all immigrants but judging whether they are terrorist or not is better way. To do so, immigration law should be reconsidered. The opinion of Senator Rick Santorum is good although it seems to be similar to the opinion of Trump. He said, 'I've proposed actual concrete things and immigration law that would have - not the effect of banning all Muslims, but a lot of them because we need to get rid of the visa lottery system, which is the way in which a lot of radicals have come into this country,' I'm all for him. The refusal to accept immigrants only make the situation worse."
6592,"I think what Bill Gates says is basically true. I think that private sector is kind of selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. And I think he is great because he is not a kind of person who only says his opinion but he is a person with great action. I know he is a great person, because I have seen him done a lot of charity and donations with Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. His company known as Microsoft has donated a lot of money when the Tohoku Earthquake occurred. He has been considering about poor people and those who lives under poverty. In his quotes he mentions that the climate change has to be solved in the rich countries, and after that it should be cheap enough for everyone else to use. I think he is saying totally right thing. Basically developed countries have the money to invest and advanced technology. So they should benefit other countries by doing what they can, because that is what makes everyone's life happy. It is surprising to know that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, though it is the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. Because in my opinion China was the last country to do green investment. I know how much they need to start using green energy, since I have a friends from Shanghai in Keio university and she told me once that you cannot really live in Beijing because of the air pollution. There is one more hit for capitalism as an economy in this article. It is the survey concluding the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. Even if it is true, I think it is something you cannot change, because it happens all the time. Smart people get smarter, and as with the same, rich people get richer in this world. But I feel a need to solve this problem in some way."
6593,"I think Donald Trump is very unique candidate. He always suppose things that American may think once everyday in their mind. When one hear what he says first, he may be really surprised and amazed. But Obama,a reasonable elite,is not being able to leading USA to remarkable development now. and his words is become meaningless among some parts of people. For them,Trump's simple and radical opinions seem more interesting than Obama's excellent speech. Of course,most of the things Trump says is almost impossible to be done. And every American knows that. So,why supporters of this unique candidate exist? The answer is 'Cooped-up feeling'. I think. Everyone want peace,want to be being a rational adult.But problems,global warming,the deal of European refugees,Chinese military expansion,Middle Eastern countries' conflicts and so on, appear everyday and they looks difficult to solve. World seems be becoming worse. People think ''Why am I here? Why things goes bad? Am I to blame for? So, what should I do? But why should I think such things? Things was going well without thinking and such gloomy stress not long ago...'. I think people is always thinking especially recently,and they are already weary of thinking. Donald Trump was appeared in front of such people.His radical opinion and vulgar language never sounds like the gospel,but what he says is actually appealing to American nostalgism to some extent. That's why this strange man is being to be in the news all over the world. But seeing this with a point of view as a other country, it merely seems like that many American is attracted by a demagogue. And if he is elected, lots of countries which don't like USA will be really happy,and praise the 'NEW PRESIDENT' from the bottom of their heart. As a Japanese, I want USA and her citizen make a wise decision. I believe."
6595,"I agree with you. Trump's statement was really thoughtless. His story was just a groundless rumor. Nonetheless, he talked about it in public. He is not aware of responsibility as a candidate for the president. And also, the measure against terrorism should be reconsidered all over the world so that the tragedy in Paris will be repeated never."
6596,"I think there are too many things to consider when it comes to who deserves to get the Nobel Prize, who choose it, how they decide and how you pick one if there are two similar situations and so on. But I think Nobel Prize should be given to those who Alfred Nobel would give to.And it is the people who works for disarmament and against militarism, and those who builds a peace movement. It is ironic that Barack Obama won the Nobel prize in 2009 and he was ultimately responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan. That attack led to the deaths of 22 people at a hospital run by MSF which happened to win the prize in 1999.And the fact that Henry Kissinger won the Nobel prize is something hard to understand. I know it is nearly impossible to make one conclusion that everyone agree. but as I said there are a lot to think about."
6597,"I agree with Donald J. Trump. he criticised to block all Muslims from entering the United States. He said it was a temporary move in response to terrorism. I am of the opinion that Islam is not a religion, such as kill a lot of people and causing the terrorism. This is because to prohibit the entry of Muslims is not a fundamental solution of terrorism.Islam the only absolute of God (Allah in Arabic) and faith, the Qur'an that God is the ruled to people through Muhammad serving as the last prophet is a follow monotheism. It has been preached the spirit of neighborly love in the Qur'an.It can not be said we have faith really, we must love the people around in the same way as their own, and it is written in the Qur'an.The recognition that Muslim is dangerous because the cause of terrorism is a mistake, and should not block all Muslims from entering the United States because of it. President Obama 15 days, a speech at the ceremony to celebrate the citizenship of immigrants who have been held in Washington, put out as an example that the Japanese Americans were incarcerated during World War II, to oppose the prejudice against such Muslims. When Muslims cause terrorism, who are the culprits that caused the terrorist attacks in Paris? IS caused the terrorism attacks in Paris. IS is the Islamic extremist organization which works across between the Iraq-Syria. IS strictly thought that we must believe in Allah only in the doctrine. This is violating the established rights of religious freedom. In addition, they have introduced inhuman corporal punishment. IS is once again warning 'now all of Japanese's target' .we have to complete the correspondence in cooperation with the Allies that was led by the United States for the sake of world peace without hesitation to the declaration of the Islamic countries."
6598,"Bill is right in some aspects. I mean, capitalism has limit because it is consist of competition. Competition is really useful tools to generate something new but it is not good at eliminate something, shave something. However, I think, capitalism is changing gently from short-term capitalism to long-term capitalism. If companies want to get money in long term, they have to think about making profit eco-friendly. It is kind of advanced capitalism. The change is caused to existence of 'company' and global financial system. Now, there are many companies that have long history more than 100 years. And numerous money are finding place to fund in long-term. I mean, company is get to live longer than people and owner of company is get to think about sustainable growth. For example, consumable companies need growth global population. At least, they want steady market that doesn't shrink. So what should they do? I think they have to develop developed countries and make them grow. I mean, they have to make new market. This process is not like capitalism because it is amazingly long-term but some great companies do this. Google is one of these companies. They research the way of connecting people in poor countries to the Internet. Of course, it doesn't make profit in 5 to 10 or more years. Google want to do that because they want to expand the areas of their market, users. Sustainable growth in hundreds years request eco-friendly business because it needs management resources in the future. Briefly, I can understand what Bill thinks but it's not true. He is in IT industry and it's really short-term business, so he doesn't have great view of so long-term business."
6599,"It is difficult problem to solve. Because there is a gap between a developed country and developing country about environmental problem. The former will not increase rapidly, but the latter will increase possibly. So if the former propose new rule that restricts CO2 emission, the latter discourage the former from passing it. Because the latter wants to grow if even environment of nation or all over the world is destroyed. The latter think the former did the same thing in the past, so the latter think to have right developing own country. However, in the capitalism, the rich people become rich. The poor people become poor theoretically. Because the rich people's children can take the education of high quality and have powerful connection. The other hand, the poor people have to take the education of low quality and don't have powerful connection. This is a social problem among people. Needles to say, this problem can apply to nations. To put it in a different way, the rich countries keep to the rich countries. The poor countries end up being the poor countries in the capitalism. Therefore if a conflict between the former and the latter continues, I think it is difficult to solve. And we can't break the present circumstances in the world. We can't solve the environment problem and the problem of the gap the rich and the poor. So I agree with Bill Gates. I think capitalism cannot save us from climate change. After I read this article, more and more strong I think it."
6600,"I have never come up with that idea. They might be thinking by Confucian way. But you should not say that it is a old way to think, because there are a lot of things you can learn from they way people used to think. So I think it might be better if they put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism."
6601,"This news story remained me of the problem about immigration in Japan. Prime minister Abe declared that he will accept two hundreds thousands immigrants every year. I was surprised at this policy when I heard the news for the first time, because I had heard that accepting immigrants brings about many new problem about culture, welfare, job, politics, and our identity. For example, in French, the terrorists entered into a country and gave rise to a disastrous incident in last year. This incident can be based on the policy of immigration. In addition to it, in Germany, many German lost their job because of immigrants. Thus, I had known only some bat points about immigration, so I thought that accepting immigrants was the wrong policy, especially in Japan, citizens were more exclusive than other country, so this policy would be failure. I search more about this policy when I read this policy again, my thinking is changed for two reason. First, Japan comes face-to-face with harsh reality;the aging of Japan's population society. This brings about shortage of the young work force population. If we do not do anything about this problem, we cannot pay tax for welfare, and Japanese welfare system will be break down. Accepting young immigrants is an effective method to solve this problem. In present Japan, there is a great demand for the elder care business, but this business world will be troubled by labor shortage, so the job for immigrants will be increase. Second, not only person who has a nationality but also immigrants have the fundamental human rights. They have the right of a minimum standard of living. Japan should accept immigrants positively, because Japan is one of the richest and abundant countries in the world. I think that we have to be a reader to solve this problem."
6603,"I agree with your opinion and I did not know about Chewbacca because I have never watched Star Wars too. So I was very surprised and felt funny when I heard this news at first. But after understanding what was Chewbacca and so on, I thought this news was very seriously and interesting, because I have never seen such a news in Japan.You said that we have to consider this problem seriously, I think so too! And I want to spread to people who don't know about the Star Wars' any characters. And I want to exchange our opinions about this problem."
6604,"I agree with you. I think his way of thinking is distorted. But government must prevent all the possibility of danger of terrorism,so I can understand his thinking about the policy. Even though he makes many moral policies, citizens criticise him when terrorism was occurred."
6606,"I strongly agree with your idea. I also think doubt whether winners make a contribution to world 'real' peace or not. I think the Norwegian Nobel Committee has to have a rethink about who is awarded Nobel Peace Prize or how select the Nobel Peace Prize winner. In addition to this, if Nobel Peace Prize winner committed to peace after he or she award Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee would have to deprive it. Of course, I hope Nobel Peace Prize winners don't commit to 'real' peace and are willing to contribute a lot of things to it."
6607,"I think 'the poor get poorer and the rich get richer' is right. Because now in japan, basically people who have a lot of money can receive good education. It becomes slightly easy to get a stable job in the future if received good education. Even if under the capitalism, all people should receive the good education equally. The government should solve this problem. I think equal capitalist society is such a system. And I'm agree with Bill Gates' opinion 'Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch.' and 'The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions' The current development country exhausted a large quantity of CO2 with the industrialization in the past. I think that we should take responsibility for solving this problem as soon as possible! If we put it off, we can not solve this problem forever."
6610,"I also knew that Japanese social media reports only one side of Chinese environmental problem. Unless Japanese read this news, we will misunderstand China is the country which continue to pollute a huge amount of CO2 emissions. In this time, I recognize the industrialized countries such as China, German, and US started to make an effort to decrease CO2 so we can expect that the countries all over the world will solve this environmental problem in the future. And I hope Japan is the top country that contributes to lower CO2 emissions in the world."
6611,"When I read this news at first, I was surprised at knowing China have been making an effort to decrease CO2 emissions. That is because I image the industrialized countries, especially China, have no interest in lower CO2 emissions. In Japanese mass media, China tends to be reported to remain the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. So I think Bill Gate's idea is great. While the only poor countries which produce less CO2 emissions tackling the CO2 problem hardly, unless the rich countries which utilize the huge amount of CO2 take some actions to solve the problem, The effort of the former countries result in nonsense. So like his idea the climate problem such as CO2 emissions should be solved in both poor and rich countries."
6615,"I think so too. Actually his speech gets attention easily, and some terrorists might hears his statements anywhere in the world. In present, mass media or SNS is expanding in the world, so statements of all people on the Internet is strengthening their influence on various international issues or arguments. Therefore, people have to be careful to transmit their opinion on the Internet with a light heart, because we do not know who, when and where someone will be going to attack us in this times. People in the US also might be attacked by the influence of the man who says extreme statements to the dangerous terrorism organization many times. If the US will be attacked, impact that gives to all over the world is immeasurable. I think that Donald J. Trump has to think of protecting citizens in the US if he wants to be the President of the US with a strong leadership."
6616,"It's fact that terrorism is very scary. It is natural that Trump wants to refuse the entry to the united states of Islam. But as Hillary Clinton wrote on Twitter, Hate is not an American value. The United States consist of a lot of immigrants. Certainly, refusing Islam is one of the measures to prevent terrorism. However, it may produce the hate of Islam people at the same time. Trump's way of thinking is including racism. Learning from the history, 'Racism' often cause war! The abolition of the racism is important to make peaceful world without the war."
6617,"I agree with your opinion and I think so, too. When I read this article for the first time, I only paid attention to the look of Chewbacca because he had a lot of visual impact for me. However, it was not until I read it some times that I noticed about what he wants to declare firmly, and it was so great. And I think it is a good peg for people all over the world to know the reality of life for many Ukrainians."
6620,"I think, Donald J. Trump should not have said that. That's because, he is a presidential candidate in America. America has the spirit of free and equal, so the next reader of them should not do discrimination. There is a statistics that a quarter of the Muslim in the US can justify violence to the country as a crusade. It is said that he have referred to the data. However, it suggests that three fourths of Muslim do not justify it. In addition, many people doubt the truth of the statistics. In such situation, his opinion cannot have good grounds. I think, the Islam is not evil, but his remark can make people have prejudice against Muslim. And in this sentence, there is a description that 'He said it was a temporary move in response to terrorism, citing President Franklin D. Roosevelt's authorization of the detention of Japanese, German and Italian immigrants during World War II as a precedent'. In other words, he considers all Muslim as enemy. However, it would not make the problem be settled and a chain of the hatred spreads. I think, we do not refuse them but try to look the way understanding each other."
6621,"When I read this news for the first time, I was very surprised because Donald J. Trump used a lot of offensive words against Islamic estates, immigrants, London, and so on. Recently, terrorism has happened in Paris. This news makes us scared. By the sports, the free skate of the USU Grand Prix Series in Paris which is the meeting of the figure skating was called off. From this the damage by terrorism is heavy. I'm also afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. So we should refrain from the remarks like him."
6626,"The most interesting point of this article was the difference between the ways of reading text of man and woman,I thought. This theme made me remember an event I experienced when I attended the class of Germany. In that class,teacher said 'Please translate this word 'nichte meiner Schwiegermutter' from Germany into Japanese.'. This mean 'my mother-in-law's niece' in English.Of course I meant she is my wife's mother's niece.But my girl class mates meant her husband's niece. Though we read the same sentence,the different character we saw in the sentence! It's not a surprising thing generally at all.But, since I usually relatively deal man and woman as same thing,I strongly felt the difference of sex there. So,when I saw the opinion 'The test clearly assumes the test-takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? ',I remember this memory."
6627,I disagree with your comment because you can't rightly see accomplishment of the Nobel Peace Prize winners. It is true that they also did bad thing---so ---as other people. They are people. We are people. So their doing bad action is usual as we do bad action. However their accomplishments are so big. They truly change the world. This accomplishment should be praised by world's people. Therefore the Nobel Peace Prize is necessary for us.
6628,"Donald J. Trump on Tuesday stood by his call to block all Muslims from entering the United States. He said it was a temporary move in response States. He said it was a temporary move in respond'' It is true that after be attacked in Paris, there are fears of terrorism in world. Therefore, to remove that's fear it is natural that take a method like Donald Trump's policy. But I think that there are no future without terrorism. So I don't agree with Donald Trump's idea."
6629,"When I read this article, I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So, I think that National Judicial of Exam should review their idea ."
6630,"I am agree when I read this news. I think that the discrimination by a race and the religion must not do it. There is surely the person attacking us in people of the Islam. For example, terrorism was caused last year in Paris. It is very scary that terrorism is had. However, I think that there must not be such a thing. This is not high-sounding statement. There was the discrimination of the Korean during war in Japan. Japan regrets it. We must not repeat the history. (88 words)"
6631,I agree with you very much. Racial discrimination must be abolished. There are many religions in the world. We should be free to practice our own religion. Trump will think that there is the danger that all Muslims do an act of terrorism. This thought is nonsense.I also think that we should not discriminate people by race and religion.
6632,"When I read this article , I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So I think National Judicial of Exam should review their idea."
6633,"You are right.I only forced on the joke candidates,but now I see it also important to think about the traditional dirty tactics already existed.We have to find what is happening there in reality."
6634,"Your opinion that his offensive speech is his strategy is very interesting to me. Indeed, Trump's attitude is confident and conservative, and his opinion is outrageous. Thus he can expect easily that he was criticized. I think his aim is to attract people's attention that the fear of terrorism is no longer foreign affairs, so the United States should secure its borders carefully. Especially the United States experienced terrible terrorist attack in 2001, so I can understand there are some people who hate and scared of terrorism."
6636,"I strongly agree with your idea that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have answer, and people's life is equal, so we can not decide it. However, we must make an effort to understand the doctrine of Confucianism which is deeply connected with the Chinese culture. The Confucian has moral concept indicating that a child has to follow faithfully to the parent. This is in the root of the doctrine. This is why the answer that we have to save our mother in situations where the mother and girlfriend are drowning can be understood. I hear that teaching of this Confucianism parents unconditionally is based on the premise that love children. Based on this condition, in the situation where a child and husband are drowning, what selection a wife should chose?"
6637,"I agree with the points of that I cannot understand the intention of this question either, but I do not think that Chinese people usually help their mother or father because of Confucianism. Even if they have a religious thought of Confucianism, they might be not influenced by those religious thought. If they make decisions that they help their mother or girlfriend with the religious thought, that seems to be considered the life of a girlfriend is not treated equally. That goes against the legal mind. I think examinees should think calmly and write an answer without any religious problems. However, this question probably does not have an answer. In addition, I do not understand what is the general idea of the Chinese and European. I do not think they have a specifically idea that they might help their girlfriend. I also think who need to know an answer of the question, but I thought people who made this examination wants to know the response capabilities of the trainees in a serious situation."
6638,"I was surprised when I read this news at first time. I believe that capitalism is great system. However there are a lot of people with various opinion in the world. Many developed countries which are almost capitalism. In particular, Japan is a rich country. And we would be satisfied to become rich. However Sometimes the rich countries have to trouble to other countries. Its representative is a global warming. Developed countries were allowed to develop the industry in order to become rich, so carbon dioxide emissions from developed countries. Developed countries are also use natural energy, but it is a fact that developed countries emission of carbon dioxide. Moreover I was surprised at the price of 2 trillion. Huge amount of money, I think that person should be considered well how to use. Furthermore I was surprised that China is focusing on the development of natural energy. And I think that European countries because they reduced emissions of carbon dioxide. I feel that there are many people who think about environmental problems in the world."
6640,"When I read this article for the first time, I was very impressed. In Japan, there is a serious problem. It is great gap about income. If a family does not have money, the child who was raised will be poor.In the future, Japan will be aging society. Our generation who is eighteen to twenty years old have to support this aging society. Indeed, we have no choice to avoid aging society. But we have to consider and think solution. First, we have to have money to help the old. So the government have to raise the income. This solution is hard for the small and medium-sized enterprise. But to think the future society, this solution must be conducted I think. Second, I think the government must take some activity. For example, to support to help the countryside people. In the urban city, there are many good infrastructures and a home for the old. On the other hand, in the rural society, there are few home for the old. Indeed, in the rural society people support each other. But If the old died in his house, possibly no body can notice this situation. So the Japanese government have to support this point."
6641,"The law is quite silly. The correct answer depends on many different factors. Do you and your wife or girlfriend have a child together? If yes you should save her before you save your mother. How old is your mother.... if your mother is over 60 you should save your girlfriend first.... She potentially has more years left to live. There are many other factors, like their health, how much you love them, and which one's death would affect less people in a negative way."
6642,"I disagree with your idea. It goes without saying that the problem and the answer exist. It is not logical that 'there is the appropriate answer because this is the problem of the examinations' in your criticism for my having criticized the answer that China's Ministry of Justice thought about. You cannot understand my thought and what I want to say. On the examination of China's Ministry of Justice, the answer that they thought about is, not to mention, right, and in contrast, considering our ethic and moral, the answer is wrong completely. You should have the idea same as my idea because you said, 'Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us.' I want you to reconsider my opinion and this article well once again."
6643,"I agree with your idea. The other day I saw the same new of this article . There are written Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. So I also think strange that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens, so I disagree this Nobel Peace Prize."
6646,"I agree with you at some points. For example, you said what he said is violent language. I think so too. There are many Muslim who live peacefully in the US. His remark injure such people. Donald J. Trump was a presidential candidate. I think, such person can change this situation by other ways. For instance, he can fix the social security system more for the young. In fact, there are the young who support IS because of distrust in their government. I think, such way is more realistic than refuse all Muslim."
6648,"I don't be able to determine clearly whether Mr. Trump's proposal is good or bad. Since 9.11 large scale acts of terrorism have occurred all over the world. They are very dangerous and it is difficult to prevent terrorism from occurring. So, it may be best way for preventing occurring terrorism to ban Muslims immigration. However, nobody knows whether prevent it or not by doing so. In addition to this, Muslims totally unrelated to terrorism will not be able to go on a trip to America. I want to know and think more deeply about this issue."
6649,"I'm with your opinion that people should feel that the crisis is coming. We feel as if terrorism and the attacks were the foreign affairs and they would never come to Japan. However, we can't foresee the future and it is always unsure. We have to be careful and look at what is going on around the world like what the attacks in Paris mean to us and to the world order. The developing countries need initiative and support of developed countries like The United States and Japan. We have to be their role models, which means that the government should act correctly. It also means that the citizens must consider whom we vote. When we provide developing countries with new technology, history, nature and culture of that area should necessarily be taken into account."
6650,"I see your point, but I am of the opinion that at first glance it may seem to those of just a name only, it is worth. This is because Nobel Prize has authority.Nobel Prize is a global award that began in 1901 in accordance with the will of Alfred Nobel, known as dynamite inventor. It is a prize that honors that have been established in the hope of to lasting peace.Attention to the Nobel Prize is very high. In many countries it will be broadcasting the scene of ceremony through the mass media such as television. Furthermore winner of Nobel Prize will be celebrations by all over the country. 100 years ahead is resting name in textbooks of history also is about your name is known throughout. It is true that Novel peace prize may be awarded to the leader of the dissident under tyranny, it is common to receive a backlash from the government of the winners of the country. This might also be cause given rise to conflicts between nations. But if we use this authority in the right direction and will stand in the role in terms of the aim of lasting peace."
6655,"I think his statement and action is wrong. So I am disagree with you. It is true that people who live in the country accepting Islamic immigrant are afraid of terrorism. But I think hatred is raised by experiencing racism discrimination, to be left out and so on. The hatred that lost a place to go leads to terrorism or war."
6656,"I agree with your opinion that no one want to follow him even if he is elected. I think it will not make true democracy, too. A election system is very important for political."
6659,"'More developed countries were less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement 'The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last.'' I was really interested in this part of the article.It seems that developed countries is giving up capitalism. But when we see the India, most of them are believing 'The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last'. What makes this difference? First of all,there is the gap of power of economy .Developed countries are very wealthy and they may be able to buy anything they want.Though this is exaggeration,they're are at least fulfilled materially to some extent . If a man contents with his life, he never want to work,or even think. The Developed countries 'giving up' is just like this. They are content with what they are. I think this is good. Only Developed countries can such feeling. But like India,developing countries are 'developing'.They always think how they can win developed countries,how defeat developed countries,how put developed countries under them,how wonderful it would be if they could achieve such beautiful world. To give up capitalism is 'good'. But if developed countries give up capitalism,who call them 'Developed Countries'? So, criticise capitalism is good.But they must not give up capitalism,I think. If they give up capitalism,next may be the era of India and China or other countries. That's my thought."
6661,"When I read this article for the fist time, I feel angry and suspicious. First, it is so ridiculous to criticize one religion. Indeed, it is not strange that some one in the world criticizes one religion. But Donald Trump is the man that will possibly be a president of the United States. He has a great influence on many sections. Recently, Donald Trump started to shed CM about a manifest. This plan is, as the article said, to ban the Islamic from entering United States. Indeed the situation about the middle east is very serious because the Islamic state killed many people and occupy many city. I watched the news yesterday, in the future,the Islamic state want to occupy Mecca. But I think to discriminate someone who is Islamic is too bad. Because all Islamic are not very dangerous. People all over the world have to be dealt with equally regardless of their religion. In Japan, there are many people who have no religion. So some Japanese can not understand this situation. But people all over the world can understand that to discriminate against some who is Islamic is bad. I think the politician, Donald Trump, is very inhumane.But in the United States, a few people support him. Indeed, Islamic state is fearful and dreadful. To ban the Islamic from entering United States is one way. But I think this is final way. There are many other ways. First, the government enforces immigration check very much. Second, the government stops selling the gun. In the future, Japan will face this situation, but I want Japanese government not to conduct such a way."
6662,"I can understand your felling, but I do not know if I agree with you. I think, the immigrants from Islamic countries are victims of IS's attack. So, they are not terrorists. Of course, there could be terrorists hiding among the immigrants like the case of Paris. However, we have to tell common Muslims from terrorists clearly. I think that many Japanese do not want to accept immigrants positively. Maybe the fact that Japan is an island nation and we have strong identity affect it. We should have understanding of the immigrants more."
6664,"I agree with you. Candidates who ran playfully will give a bad effect on democracy. Politics must be faced with a belief in themselves and their political parties. Therefore to run for election in half ridicule is a insult to other candidates. Correspondence of the Ukrainian government for such candidates is reasonable. I think that there is a chance that celebrities who is not familiar with politics is not good. You should go extrusion with his policies and a commitment to bring it forward if to run for election. With person of name recognition and policy combined, it will be possible to spread widely the policy. It is also often cited as hereditary problems in Japanese politics. However, that the child is interested in the profession of his father as a matter of course. The eligibility is a right that everyone has. This is why it is not inequality. I also want to become a politician if there is a chance."
6665,"I have a different opinion. I agree with your opinion at the point that he should be arrested due to break legislation that forbids campaigning, but I don't think so much that such people never appear as you said. I am not fanatic fan of Star Wars myself, so I cannot understand his feeling, but his action is one of the political claims that he supported for Darth Vader. Recently, in Japan, young people are not interested in politics and don't participate in political election, which situation is one of the social problems. Compared with this situation, this event is wired indeed, but I don't think a severe problem."
6667,"As The United States is now the most powerful nation throughout the world, they have to lead the world to better direction. It is not impressive that the top of the strong country says that they will block any immigrants from middle-east. I understand that the government has role to protect their people and land, but from the point of view of humanity, they should save immigrants and refugees too. Once they refuse to do it, they won't given any help when they face difficulties, which exactly means that the world will abandon him. Difference of what you believe undoubtedly exists because no one is the same person as someone else. Religion has been used as political tool since it was born long time ago, then we should start to consider how to handle it and how not to be handled by it."
6669,"That is an interesting opinion. Actually I also thought he did this occasion to get attention from all over the world. When I watched this news on TV, I was so interested in the political party which Chewbacca is belonging to, because it is so an unique idea. Add to this, TV show also picked up this political party in the Ukraine over the daily. His act after arresting was in an embarrassing way, but it was also impressive. I did not know anything about the Star Wars till I checked this topic on the Internet, so I studied the characters of the Star Wars and the situation in the Ukraine because I thought that is a good opportunity to know them. We cannot see those political activity in Japan. In this time, their performance is known as a bad action to the world, however, young people might get interests in politics if any Japanese political party tries to do some unique performance like that. I do not know their future, but I expect that they will make a contribution for the Ukraine if they do not break the rule any more."
6670,I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. I think that there are rights to choose option.
6671,I am agree with you. The Nobel Peace Prize should be given to the person who did his/her best to make peace. I also don't understand why Barack Obama was given the Nobel Peace Prize. He did only speech twice for disarmament. The United State still dispatches a soldier to the various places. The armament may be the things which are important to get an international position as China and USA are making a strong effort on military affairs.But The Prize should be given to really peaceful people.
6674,"At first I thought that we must change to use other powers. Because, fossil fuels have the limit and if we make power by electricity with fossil fuel, then it makes much more carbon dioxide emissions, I think. So, I think that we should use green energy. Green energy has great variety. For example water power and solar power and wind power and so on. But it costs much money to use them. In the future, a problem of the money may be the biggest burden and most important topic. So, Bill Gates contributed much money is very wonderful action, I think. I may be able not to contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money and I will spend all money for me or my family. But, he gave away all his money to charity. What a man who give one's all money away for charity! I think that he must be generous man and I respect him after hearing this news. I wish that he helps for making new energy. And I wish that he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions too. Now, increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem . Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. I think we must stop the rise in temperature immediately. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment. And I want to spread a opinion to think more seriously about decreasing carbon dioxide all over the world. If we don't think it individual, its problem will attack our descendant. And its problem will become much more bigger than now, I think. This situation is very dangerous and difficult to improve, so we should think and spread and act! At first, I will reduce to use air-conditioning to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. And I will try not to waste to take a shower and watch TV and so on."
6675,"I agree with your opinion. To share information is the most important when do communication. In the past,to share information or knowledge needed very complicated process to be done.Because all process was the work of human. All human are living thing,and all of them have some problems.More people relate the conveying of information,more troubles may happen.But we are now living the era of IT.We can access many kinds of information immediately.This is also helping the communication of countries.To share information have become much easier than the past. If people themselves make a little more effort,world may be much better place for us, I think."
6676,"Surely, I don't think it is impossible that the poor becomes rich. But I don't agree with you. Now I think the means is also very difficult. To go to good school, It is difficult to pass an examination without going to the private supplementary school and it cost much money to go to the private supplementary school. So for all the poor, it is not easy. There is the scholarship, but there are few numbers in Japan and it cannot be surely said that all poor people have a chance. First I wish what these expand."
6678,"Of course, creatures of life is something important equally.However I think that thinking this question is not a problem because it is a mere question. So,I disagree with your opinion."
6679,"Your comment is absolutely right. We never recognize what Mr. Trump said. Of course, that comments of him connects with racism like Hitler. He is the source of generating hate and pain. We never discriminate people by sexes, races and religions. The United States accepts immigration. This helps many refugees all over the world. I want them to continue it."
6681,"I also think all people in the world should share the information about pollution. The countries which emit a lot of CO2 should have a sense of shame that 'Does our country exhaust carbon dioxide so much?' All country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and compete each other."
6683,"I also laughed that arrested man said 'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' It is very funny joke. I think it helps that the news was met with amusement online all over the world. It was a great effect. And I agree with your opinion about Democracy, too. The better education becomes, the more knowledge of politics a lot of young people acquire."
6685,"I disagree with you.Because his vulgar language is very disgusting and makes me really irritated.If other people hear his radical speech,they may be angry and destroy their TV. And what he says is out of logic.Before notice his 'strategy',most of people leave from his sight."
6686,I agree with your opinion partly. Indeed I and everyone are afraid of terrorism. To fight the terrorism have to be taken. But to ban the Islamic from entering the US is not good. And I agree with your opinion which he wanted to save only US.
6689,"I agree with your opinion. Your comment is so great. First, the awarding system of Nobel Prize have to be considered many times. And people in Japan have to notice the peace is rare."
6690,"I agree with your opinion. To be honest, I don't know the real situation of Tunisia, but when I know that gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens, I am very sorry for Tunisian people because they may feel complex rather than happy. I learn that it is important not to see the event from one aspect and not only winner of the Noble Peace Prize but also giver of that has responsible for each other."
6691,"Bill Gate's action is very grateful and nobody act as Bill Gate. His opinion makes sure. However, it is not real. I have thought him realist even. He started Microsoft and created Windows OS. He has a great head for business. Using it, he became the top of millionaires. So, I thought that his idea was real very much. I believe that fossil fuels are essential in modern society. If fossil fuels are exhausted, our society will collapse. Renewable energies not being supplied much can't support our society. Finally, fossil fuels are only generator supporting our life for the present. About the distant future, we will have the solution of energy problem. It is nuclear fusion. Now it is technologically difficult to use nuclear fusion, but we mostly generate energy by nuclear fusion in future. Bill Gate should invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion. However, I don't say renewable energy is no useful. I say renewable energy don't become main energy source in our society and we should develop nuclear fusion more primarily than renewable energy. If I were Bill Gate, I will invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion."
6692,"I regret that he declared that he expel Islam emigrant. In late years the reaction to Muslim is changing by an action of terrorism and ISIL, but I think that it is wrong to expel all the members because it is a part."
6693,"I think that Trump's statement put out American real. The United States is a country of immigrants from the first. A lot of races, for example the Anglo-Saxon race, Latin race, Hispanics and Slaves and so on, get gather in the U.S. and the United States completed. So, the U.S. is often called 'salad bowl'. Now the United States accepts constant number of immigrant every year. This is impossible for Japan having problem that is accepting immigrant or not accepting immigrant. On the other hand, the United States and a lot of Americans experience 9 11 terrorism. This terrorism is to hijack airplane and to attack the building, named World Trade Center (WTC), in central of New York by hijacked airplane. Many people were killed in the terrorism and living people don't forget the terrorism. Al-Qaeda, Islam terrorist group, practiced this terrorism. So, Americans don't like Islam people, but a lot of Islam people want to come to the United States as immigrant now. The United States and Americans are troubled 'salad bowl' or 'fear of terrorism'. Tramp chooses 'fear of terrorism' So, he can say banning Muslim immigration. Before saying, there are 'salad bowl' and 'fear of terrorism'. Whether people agree with Tramp' idea is that the most important thing for the United States is 'salad bowl' or 'fear of terrorism'."
6695,"I know there are Darth Vader and his subordinates in Ukraine, but don't know that Chewbacca, one of Darth Vader's subordinates, was arrested. In addition, I don't know Star Wars very much. However, hearing the news, I think Star Wars is very famous movie all over the world and a lot of people like Star. By the way, there are a lot of election systems in the world. In Ukraine, people who want to stand as a candidate don't need to use real name. So, Darth Vader could come forward as a candidate by name of 'Darth Vader'. In Brazil, all candidates can decide their candidate name, too. Of course, Japan and a lot of countries don't allow candidates to decide their candidate name, but it has several merits for candidates to decide their candidate name. A first merit is that unique names are often born and that the election activates very much. If election activates very much, a lot of citizen will be interested in politics. Next merit is that candidates can have character by candidate name which candidates decide. If candidate name were 'Darth Vader', the candidate will get very strong character. However, this system has big demerit. It is citizen can't know candidate's real maybe. This incident occurs for the demerit."
6697,"Hearing the article, the article idea is the same to my idea. There are six Nobel Prize, but I think Nobel peace prize don't need only. I have three reasons supporting my opinion. Firstly, 'peace' is ambiguity. People say that peace is not to break out wars. If people's idea is true, cold war age will be very peaceful age because there is not world war. So, we should establish unclear Nobel peace prize. In addition, Norway use Nobel peace prize for politics. For example, when EU awarded Nobel peace prize, EU had dangerous breaking. Norway gave Nobel peace prize to EU for breaking. It is not good for Nobel Prize. Finally, the most important reason is that parson who shouldn't get Nobel peace prize can get Nobel peace prize. In the past, people inducing wars got Nobel peace prize. For example, Hitler and so on. It is better to be banned Nobel peace prize than they get Nobel peace prize. All in all, I think that Nobel peace prize don't need for our society. Things we need is not Nobel peace prize but hurts of seeking peace."
6698,"I think so too. I think we are not able to answer this question. Our lives are equal. In my opinion, the question which forces students to choose which person will you help is itself nonsense. However taking it into consideration that the question is made in China, it may be influenced by the thinking of the Confucianism, which say we should take good care of older people. I can not help thinking that the man or woman who made this question is so stupid."
6699,"I think that test makers have all responsible. This incident is, in summarize, that answer in the National Judicial Exam is against ethics. Moreover, there are several choices in question. Test makers should consider choices in question when they make exams and weren't criticized about choices in question from general people. Especially, the exam is the National Judicial Exam. Test makers should pay attentions very much and they knew that. If the incident occurred in Japan, it will become a very big problem in society. The incident occurred in China, needless to say, it became the one of biggest problems in China. By the way, why did such a incident accrue radically? Fault of the National Judicial Exam system? Lack of test makers? I don't think such reasons. I think that the reason is separation between law and common sense. Of course, in common there is separation between law and common sense, but it isn't allowed because it accrues such a big problem. It runs short of test maker's efforts only to solve this problem. All people who know law much must do their best to solve this problem. If they do, this big problem will be solved in future. Moreover, there is the problem in only China. The problem may occur in Japan and there is some possibility of doing. Not becoming so, we always pay attention for separation between law and common sense. I as one parson learning laws will consider this problem and this incident."
6702,"I agree with your opinion. Originally, we can't decide value of human life and all people's lives are equal. I can't choose girlfriend or mother. However, Chinese government decided value of human life by legislation. Chinese government's decision and the question were allowed against ethnic. I was very sad to think people answering the question which don't have answer in the National Judicial Exam. So I think Chinese concerned with law should protest Chinese government's decision and disagree with Chinese government's answer. Such incident may occur in Japan. when it occur in Japan, I will protest Japanese government's decision and disagree with Japanese government's answer. Certainly, law is a strong rule, but the most important thing is that ethics is one of the strong rules, too."
6703,I agree with your opinion deeply. It is usual that there are many poor families. But the government did not take proper manifest. And we have to think this problem deeply.
6705,"I can understand what you want to say, but just calm down and take a deep breath. I recommend you to reread this article again. The question is just the story of man. Is it right to say that the question is really sexism? I cannot think in that way at all. I am sorry to say, but you are a little too sensitive."
6706,"I agree with your opinion. I think that Nobel peace prize don't need. There are a parson making wars break out, a human agreeing with violence and people do nothing for peace in Nobel peace prize winners. Why did they get Nobel peace prize? One reason is that Norway uses Nobel peace prize for politics. Giving Nobel peace prize, Norway gets winner's good inspection and helps not only winner's good action but winner's bad action. So, Hitler began World War 2 and Obama restarted violence named 'fighting against terrorism'. Second reason is that there is Nobel peace prize every year. Originally, there is never a great parson or a great organization for peace every year. Otherwise, Nobel peace prize winner is announced every year. So, quality of Nobel peace prize winner is decreasing. In the other words, Nobel peace prize is got no value. Before saying, I think that neutral organization should decide Nobel peace prize winner and Nobel peace prize winner is chosen every 4 years. If Nobel peace prize changes my idea, Nobel peace prize will return the most valuable prize all over the world in future."
6707,"I agree with your opinion. Nowadays, Japan is very dangerous. Rich men's children become rich for good. Poor men's children become rich for good. In ancient there are a lot of middle in Japan. However, it begins to collapse. If current working generation retires, Japan won't have working men and don't move economical differentials. Old people have a lot of money and don't use the money. Young people have a little money. The worst situation is that a gap-widening society completes and young men don't have wishes, go out Japan to foreign countries. Japan can't return even Japan and there are no rich men in Japan. So, I think that Japan should know limit of current capitalism and consider correcting current capitalism"
6708,"You are right. we would upset and couldn't make a good decision if we were in such situations. There is also the possibility that we wouldn't help neither of them. To summarize, the question is nonsense."
6709,When I read this article and knew that almost all the Nobel peace prize winners are not justified according Nobel's wish I was surprised and very shocked. And the nobleness of the Noble peace prize is decreasing and becoming the prize only in name. To regain the nobleness I think that the Nobel committee should take it seriously and think who to award the prize carefully enough. Many people all over the world want the Noble peace prize to be more respectable. Someday I want to win the Nobel peace prize.
6711,"I agree with you.Donald Trump's idea is too radical.USA government should think the immigrants as lives. And I also think,to be radical is actually good for solving one problem,but if solve one problem in such way,more difficult problems will be appear.Though radical opinion looks simple and easy to do,this is the most difficult way to solve problem. I think."
6712,"I totally agree with you. I was shocked to read this article. Some people who won the Nobel peace prize was concern with wars. This fact means that they are at the other end of the spectrum. I am not able to respect these people. Your idea that the criterion should be clearer to make it better is a good idea. I don't want such people, for example, Obama, Kissinger to be winners of the award from now on too."
6713,I think so too. I also had been thinking that the Nobel peace prize was always award to people who were respected by all the people and who kept on doing peaceful active to the end of their lives. I think that the selection of the Nobel peace prize winner should be improved. However the difficulty of the selection of the Nobel peace prize is that the winner who we think is suitable can do violent actions. When the Barack Obama won the Nobel peace prize I was thinking that he is peaceful person and he is proper to the prize. But after that he decided the US drop bombs in Afghanistan.
6714,"I agree with you. To select the Nobel peace prize is a very difficult problem. There are little distinction between peace and war. We cannot say some who ended the war is the peaceful person and vice versa. Many people were killed by the bombing in Afghanistan and it was decided by the Nobel peace prize winner, Barack Obama by the name of justice. As you say we have to pay attention to the occurrence in the background of the receiving it and the later incident."
6715,"I agree with you and I think so, too. The Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded with result of genuine peace. Even if somebody fought for his peace and became a hero, if he murdered the partner who fought, not only he is a hero, but also is a murderous fiend. And more a new fight may be born by suppressed hatred. Can we call this true peace? I do not think so at all. So the Nobel Peace Prize be awarded from a fair viewpoint."
6716,"When I read this article for the first time I was very surprised. Some people in the class say that we have to take it into serious consideration and it is the matter of democracy. However it is just a joke. It is a funny news. And I am a big fun of Star Wars so this news is very interesting for me. I don't have many information and impression about Ukraine, but this news make me have the impression about the country that the country is full of sense of humor. Darth Vader is running for a mayor of a city? Chewbacca is campaigning for Darth Vader and he was arrested? What a amusing news it is! I was not able to read this article without laughing. These days this country has been reported to the dark side of it so many have negative image about this country. However these kind of funny news may make us who have negative image about the county change the way we think about the country."
6717,When I read this article I was surprised. These days terrorism is very important issue all over the world. We Japanese also are afraid of terrorism. We should not think it is somebody's else problem. In fact many people were killed by terrorism attack by Islamic estate and there are Japanese victims. The ban of Muslim immigration seems to be one of the way to prevent terrorists from coming into the united states. It is against the united stats' policy. The country is made up of immigrants. So they should not turn down immigration. And the plan which Donald Trump thinks cannot be the solution for terrorism of Islamic estate. I cannot understand the reason why he is applauded by many people. Can't they imagine what will happen if the policy will really be enacted. This plan will provoke terrorists. This plan makes further hate of terrorists toward the country. I think that this plan will end up causing another terrorism attack. This problem is too difficult but to make the peace and better world we should go on thinking about the problem and make a great effort to solve the problem.
6718,I agree with your opinion. I am also afraid of terrorism attack by Islamic estates. I think the plan to ban of Muslim immigration cannot be the good solution for the problem too. As Hillary Clinton said on twitter hate is not an American value. I believe that someday we can solve this big problem.
6720,"After I read this article I thought some opinions. First, I agree with Bill Gates. I also think that without a substantial carbon tax, there is no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the linnet of limit of cycle of growth in capitalism and we are noticing about that. Capitalism is the system that developing countries are making a large quantity of cheap goods and selling them to developed countries. But now the wage of developed countries is rising so the system is difficult to keep. Other opinion is that in this system rich people are getting more rich and poor people are getting more poor. Finally, population problem is serious. This is because the production age population has been aging and the young population has been decreasing. We should be think about it more seriously."
6721,I agree with your opinion.You have some good points. You know well about the negative points of the capitalism. and what I would like to say is all included in your opinion.
6723,"I was very shocked when I read this article at first time. Trump's remark is racial discrimination. However Trump is supported by a lot of people. This fact signify that people feel terrified by terrorism in France. If I encountered a scene of terror, probably I feel terrorism. However I think it is wrong for that trump's opinion. Trump's opinion is that deny entry of Muslim believers. All of Muslim is not terrorist. Moreover I think that Trump should not say this opinion, because Trump is a statesman. The statesman is leader of the country. Leader should not do discrimination. Muslim is afraid by people because terrorism has occurred in France. However I think that Trump makes use of an inordinate from terrorism. It is very sad for me. I want to become a world that is not of discrimination in religion."
6724,I agree with your opinion.'Joke candidates must understand the unstable politics in Ukraine.But For foreign people this case might be the good occasion that they were interested in the recently politics in Ukraine.
6725,"I agree with you. I also doubt that the Muslim immigrants are equal to terrorists. They do not have the hostility and are also victims. So, we should tell them to terrorists clearly. And I was interested in a point you said that If his plan comes true, other tragedy would happen like in Germany during WWⅡ. I also think, they cannot get rid of terrorism if they reject all Muslim immigrants. Of course, we have to fight against terrorism. However, we should do against racism too. Otherwise, we cannot live really peaceful society."
6726,"I really agree with your opinion! There is surely an advantage to accept immigration.For example, aspect of workforce, especially like a progressing aging society. But there are difficult points about accept immigration, which can't overlook. This is for example immigrants and natives in terms of religion, traditional, culture, language, custom, climate, and so on. And most difficult disadvantage is increasing criminal rate. Indeed, In Europe countries which accepting refugee from Middle East are in trouble increasing criminal rate. I think accepting immigration should be cautious."
6727,"I disagree with you. I was surprised when I read this news, too. And I think that Trump should not say him opinion. However I do not think that we should avoid remarks such as Trump because there is scary terrorism"
6729,"I disagree with your idea that the girlfriend is not only one in the world. Actually, it is sure that the girlfriend doesn't have her clones. Her individual life is the only one that no one else has. Then on the term of life value, you can't compare to each other. But i understand that understanding the importance of your father and mother is quite necessary. Without thinking about legitimacy or crime, we should maybe save our parents because they raise us with money that they earn. If we lost them, we would"
6730,"have to live off ourselves. On this point of view, we can't say that saving girlfriend or boyfriend is better."
6731,Your comment is so great. I think terrorism is the problem to not only countries it happened but also countries which terrorist comes from.
6735,"Your opinion that his offensive speech is a strategy is a new idea and interesting to me. Thinking this news with the idea like you, I can change my mind that I disagree with his speech simply. I also think of his strong attitude toward this problem as one of his strategy to win the upcoming election, and actually there is a fact that the approval rate of him is very high. Before I read your comment, I think that people have the same argument like him. However, like your opinion, I think his offensive speech is a strategy, and doing so on purpose, he has the aim that he attract people' interest."
6737,"I disagree with your opinion. Right from the beginning His idea leading another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WW2 is gap in your reasoning. And You ignore risk to accept immigrant. Of course I don't say that should recommend racial discrimination. But Indeed accepting immigration increase criminal rate. And If they accept immigrant from Muslim country for example Syria and Turkey now, it is too dangerous. Now, idea that should accept immigrant can be hear hypocrisy. So, I don't think his idea is inhumane. Because He is candidate of president. I can understand Tramp's idea."
6738,"I agree with your opinion that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer.If I were in the same situation, I could not choose answer. Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. However, I also think that its reason was lack of persuasiveness and it is not suitable for the important exam."
6743,"I agree with you. Even if they were able to win a vote, there is not conclusive evidence whether or not they do politics properly. Actually, we cannot vote for a doubtful person in japan, too. On the other hand, this news let us be interested in politics. This is a nice chance, I think. Because the other day, the government decided person 18 years old or older to allow the right to vote but most of youth are unconcerned about politics. So we should have more interest in them first."
6745,I can understand his opinion because many people do not realize the importance of their mother.
6749,"I think Obama is worth to get Nobel Prize because he got it. I mean, it was not a Prize for the past results, it was for the expectation for the future."
6752,"I think this news show bad aspect of democracy like populism. Democracy is really revolutionary tool, that has many bad points. To get over that, high level education is needed."
6753,"I read this article, this incident has been treated like a joke, but never not those that may be received in that way, it was thought to be those which are considered more seriously. Also, because I was interested in Star Wars by reading this article, I was looking back the whole work."
6754,"I disagree with your opinion. To begin with, I think that Nobel peace prize don't need. There are a parson making wars break out, a human agreeing with violence and people do nothing for peace in Nobel peace prize winners. Why did they get Nobel peace prize? One reason is that Norway uses Nobel peace prize for politics. Giving Nobel peace prize, Norway gets winner's good inspection and helps not only winner's good action but winner's bad action. So, Hitler began World War 2 and Obama restarted violence named 'fighting against terrorism'. Second reason is that there is Nobel peace prize every year. Originally, there is never a great parson or a great organization for peace every year. Otherwise, Nobel peace prize winner is announced every year. So, quality of Nobel peace prize winner is decreasing. In the other words, Nobel peace prize is got no value. Before saying, I think that neutral organization should decide Nobel peace prize winner and Nobel peace prize winner is chosen every 4 years. If Nobel peace prize changes my idea, Nobel peace prize will return the most valuable prize all over the world in future."
6757,I am opposed to your opinion. Because there is a possibility that the declining birthrate and aging population. Marriage with the opposite sex is I should think of law of nature.Same-sex marriage it should refrain because it may also be a problem in the religious.It might be some people that do not have to put up in people But not ginger. Also in Japan exist opinion like that.
6759,"I think so too. We should treat our lives equally. The host decided the TRUE answer was helping his mother. However, I think helping his girlfriend also respectful action. And I also think such question do not have useful to people who take the exam. They should learn more useful things for helping people by using law.I think, they should have a widely view."
6764,"First of all, I am thinking in this way. If there is a girlfriend I love for me, I choose the girl friend over my mother. Although, so many answer, so many people. I think China is backward on the legal field. In China, the traditional values of the Confucianism influence lows. However, this is not compatible with the new global standard. Looking from different angles, the law is a rule which lay down difference of value between ascendants and others. The present day, there is no this kind of law in developed countries. For example, Japanese current Penal Code replaced the provision about murder of ancestor in 1995. China should extinguish the law or change the legal interpretation. There is an opposition to Ministry of Justice, a Chinese lawyer said 'a son is legally obligated to save his parents. So if he doesn't help his family when his family is at stake while he can help him/her, he is accused of negligence. However, if he can help one before the other is injury, it will not be accused to put off the mother.' I agree him. Finally, when I read the last paragraph, I couldn't understand perfectly the meaning. Isn't this by chance? I wondered. That's probably one of the evidence of that feminism is backward in Japan."
6765,"I disagree your opinion. But I think that your opinion is very interesting. I think that it is very difficult thing for everyone to see one's mother's die, because she has brought up us for a long long times. And mother is one person who is related to us by blood directly all over the world, so it is impossible for us to compare these two people and think whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I think mother must be one's only mother, and most valuable person."
6766,"Donald Tramp insisted on plan to ban Muslim immigration. This is problem of immigration. Actually, this problem occur in the world. Germany, France and Japan and so on. For example, Germany tolerated entering a lot of immigrants for many years. Because it need people who works hard in it. However, it showed reluctance to accept immigrants recently. Because it must spend money for a lot of immigrants and became unsafe. In general, immigrants are labor power, but They can give little money. They are poor. So their children can't take the education of high quality, and they give some money from national tax. by social security system. Some people say complain about this state. If Germany is in a economic depression, the poor 'German' criticize them and they are isolated from 'German'. They get dragged into recession. This is one of the problem about immigrants. France have a lot of immigrants, too. Because France is near Africa. In addition, a lot of African can speak french. So it is easy for the poor African to enable to go to France. There are lot of immigrants in France, and there are lot of problems about immigrants in France. For instance, if there are lot of immigrants, you think they disturb the peace and order in general. It is not an exception in France. The south of France, near Africa is not safe. And the area that a lot of immigrants live in is not safe. Because they are poor, they commit a crime. So they do not be liked by 'french'. France is the same state of affairs to Germany. What is the situation in Japan now? Fortunately, there is few immigrants in Japan. We seldom have neighbors who are immigrants. There are only a lot of 'Japanese'. However, Japan will receive some immigrants. If Japan receive some immigrants, Japan get the labor force, but Japan may not be safe. Economic problem may occur. Receiving immigrants must pay attention. The USA is the same. There are a lot of immigrants in the USA. In addition, Islamic State (IS) is developing now. IS has terrorism, so IS kill a lot of people of several races in the world. It is only natural that Islamic people are not be liked in the world include the USA. So I can understand what Mr. Tramp said. Indeed, Mr. Tramp always say everything radically and extremely. And he is called in populist. For example, he criticized another candidate in a sharp tone. In addition, he used words that we can't use in public. He is criticized in these points as a matter of course. However, I can agree to his immigrant policy too."
6769,I somewhat agree with Bill Gates.Bii Gates said that richer countries are got richer and these countries won't stop using CO2 and so on.We should make treaty that order these countries follow it. We should also search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on.
6770,"I have an argument in a part of your opinion. You wrote a focus only in the United States. However, I think that this is to be able to say about the world. Trump refuses an invasion of Islam. However, I think that I may refuse the United States. Because, If the United States is attacked, this is because it thinks that it is fought. The World War will begin if a person from Islam attacks the United States."
6771,"The Nobel prize for peace has long history of nominating and granting awards to individuals who does not fit the criteria and Alfred Nobel's idea of peace. The secretive committee has nominated Stalin and even Hitler in the past. Recent winner, Barack Obama won the prize after being nominated for less than two weeks in office has also called a controversy. Barrack Obama is also responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan, in other words does not fit the model of peace that Alfred Nobel wishes which is disarmament and against militarism. In my opinion Nobel prize for peace should not be a model for peace efforts and people should not take Nobel prize for peace seriously. The prize itself has always been subject for controversies and the committee is very secretive. And most importantly Alfred Nobel, the man behind Nobel prize himself is the founder of dynamites which is violently used in wars. In my opinion the concept of the Nobel peace prize itself is a joke and probably was made to clean Alfred Nobel's image as an armament manufacturer."
6772,"At first, I was very surprised when I heard this news. I disagree with Trump, because it is discrimination if all Muslim are forbidden to entry into USA. And I think only IS should be forbidden to entry into USA."

The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that public have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all."
6774,I agree with your opinion. Because it is discrimination if all Muslim are forbidden to entry into USA.
6775,I have some questions to your opinion. What do you think that they should decide criterion a of this judgement?
6776,"I do not agree with you. Because I can't understand this article when I read it for the first time. I can't understand the Star Wars's words. For example, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' are. I think is is easy for this article to have to be understand."
6778,"'Muslim is enemy', the Idea to capture the word as enemy or Ally of dualism, makes the word simplify too much. in 2015, the word was shocked by Islamic state group. for instance, two of the victims were Japanese, intruding a journalist who often reported from war zones. and in the world, Paris was the target of the separate attacks at the star and the end of the year. radical jihadists claimed responsibility for both sets of attacks which together killed More than 140 people, and in America, 14 people was killed by a terror attack in California. now the word has been rattled by IS. French present François Hollande said, 'France is at the war' and vows revenge against Islamic state for Paris attacks. and US president Barack Obama vowed December 6 that America would destroy the Islamic state group and hunt down its followers at home or abroad, in rare address from the oval office. This problem has also affected the issue of the world's immigrants. in France, French voters give far right party historic election wins. and US Republicans seek to refuse Syria refugees. It is a part of a mounting republican backlash against the Obama administration's plan to accept thousands more immigrants from the war-torn country. US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump insisted Nov.29 he was '100 percent right ' when he said that he saw thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheering the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center. he also defended his provocative call to ban Muslims from the United States and in a then show race reshaped by national security concerns. Terrorism is a show involving the audience, I guess. To distinguish between the people in the wake of terrorism is like terrorists' ideal world. a thought 'we will not give in Inhumane terrorism' which conflicts with terrorists and people never solve the problems. and it's not only talking about Syria. we should not exclude the minority like 'To Kill a Mockingbird'"
6780,"This article is about the ultimate moral decision. There are questions and arguments that will never be solved or receive consensus from everyone. There are always being positive and negative stance and idea for any topic discussed. However, what I am talking about here is that the issue that includes a wide variety of opinions. In addition, the argument of the article, whether to save your mother or girlfriend, has neither majority nor minority stance. What I mean is that there are 50% for both opinions such to save your mother is right or to save your girlfriend is right. I thought about this issue for a while but never come up with a definite answer. And found out how silly this argument is. As I said, this argument is about moral of priority. China as a country states that your mother is more important that your girlfriend which is about the priority of moral. For example, I think saying something bad about someone pointing his or her back from behind is a bad thing to do. However, this kind of behavior usually is not counted as a crime. Of course, in some case when the situations are way too serious, that kind of act are counted as a crime and punishment will be executed. Other than those special situations, saying bad things about someone is very normal things to do for most people. Therefore, I felt the very awkward first time I read this article. There will never be a definite answer. The only way to end the discussion is to not to think about it."
6781,"My first word will be 'disappointed' and the first feeling when I read this news is 'disappointed' too. I was completely shocked by this article. I felt disappointed because I felt like being betrayed by a reliable source of information. Which means that I felt like my entire past has been denied or vanished. My dream is to receive a Nobel Prize in Japan when I was a child and I am pretty sure that many people had the same dream as myself when they were children. To receive a Nobel Prize is like the ultimate goal to pursue or to dream about for many people from different countries. There nothing about race, tradition or background difference involved in there, people from all over the world have dreamed about receiving it. Moreover, Nobel Peace Prize is the most famous one in the Nobel Prizes. There are varieties of Nobel Prize, for example, about chemistry, literacy, physics and so on. As I said, I was extremely disappointed when I first saw this article. I was completely faked. I did not doubt for a moment about reliably of Nobel Prize. I did not doubt for a moment about that Nobel Peace Prize could be mistaken to give. However, I am also relieved a bit because I did not want to get cheated for my entire life. I wanted to the truth and the truth is not always crystal clear. The truth could be gray or cruel. Which makes the life exciting and beautiful."
6782,"I think so too. Because, many people are afraid of terrorism. As what happen in France, We understand what a terrible terrorism is. So, people in the country do not want to enter Islamic."

6784,"I found it quite fun and interesting reading this news at the first time. First the picture inserted in the article was surprising. I did not recognize the creature which is getting caught in the picture so I was stunned at the first time. I thought a giant UMA was caught which is named, Chewbacca, and released to the public. Yet, by the time when I was half way down of the article I could only stop but to laugh. I did not really finish the article because it is not worth argued with someone about it. It was interesting to relate something very familiar like Star Wars and politics. It surely helps people to be more interested in politics which lead to the increase of participation of people in elections and political activities. I that case I am very positive about it. People do not always get interested in complicated things like politics so politicians have to come up with some unique idea to increase the participation rate of people. In this case is that especially for young people who have the right to vote which means that young people who are over 18 ( different situation exist in different countries). However, it does not mean that the level of politics will improve by just increase the number of participants to the elections or political activities. Or maybe the situation will get worth by increasing the number of uneducated participants. Uneducated political participants will be easily influenced by cheap media or propaganda. People who have not received any appropriate education about politics will give a negative impact to other people. What I thought when I read this news is that I would love to see more interesting and fun image on politics but politics is the most important task to think about in democratic countries."
6785,"Bill Gates says that Capitalism cannot save us from climate change. This only an opinion, yet super influential statement for the world. This is because that this quote is from one of the most if not the most influential single person in the world Bill Gates. Actually, before Bill Gates officially states that Capitalism will endanger human beings in terms of the climate change issue, climate change has been the one of the most controversial issues around the world. The appearance of climate change issue has changed the whole world in many different ways. For example, climate change has changed the behavior of developed country which will affect the world's economy. Countries have gotten together for an agreement to reduce the CO2 emissions. This agreement, Kyoto agreement, is lead by developed countries such as Japan, USA, Germany, Great Britain and so on. Those developed countries have set some goals according to the surface are and population. In the end, what happened is that environmentally friendly productions have become the most wanted and boom throughout the world in terms of manufacturing production. Environmentally efficient and friendly products have become the biggest trend for decades which changed the world's economy. Japan actually have taken the advantage of this trend by creating and spreading Japanese technology which are energy efficient. My point is that capitalism is all about making money by business. People have to be remaining in the position of freedom that is an idea of capitalism plus democracy. Bill Gates has pointed out that ideal of capitalism will never improve the situation of world's environment because the environment is not included inside the capitalism ideal when it was created and introduced to the world. I completely agree with Bill Gates but I don't think there is any way to stop the issue of climate change unless the world will face the real hazard of the environmental problem which will endanger majority of human beings."
6786,"First of all, I can understand Trump's idea but I don't think that it is an idea that important figure should say. Trump is a candidate of the president of United States of America in the next period after Barrack Obama. Besides his reputation, he is still an important figure who will give a huge influence on the wide range of not just people in the United States but all around the world. Therefore, I can understand what he is saying but I cannot agree with his idea and at the same time I think that Trump should not say this controversial quote in front of media. Religious conflict is always the most delicate and controversial topic around the world. Religious did provide relief to a tremendous amount of people but on the other hand, it also kill a lot of people as fact. I am just talking about fact and I have no opinion about the existence of religion yet some religion does include extreme idea or teaching that will lead to violence. Muslim has become the hottest topic around the world because of ISIS. Not all Muslim are ISIS and people knows that but it is hard to understand than just knowing. It is hard to not to react when you see a Muslim people walking around in a country, which is not Muslim. To draw a conclusion, I can understand what Trump is feeling and trying to say but he should not say that in front of people. He had to think about how influential he is on the media."
6787,"I agree with your comment too. In the society of capitalism, poor people can not get the big chance.So, we should think about this problem deeply."
6788,"I agree with you. And you are great to search more by yourself. I do not understand what the purpose of the Nobel Peace Prize. I do not know what contribution to peace some winners of Nobel Peace Prize did. There are some contradictions about Nobel Peace Prize between a real and an ideal. Saying ultimately, I think Nobel Peace Prize do not need to continue. At least, I think you do not make a winner or winners of Nobel Peace Prize every year. I think the value of Nobel Peace Prize must be higher. If the value of Nobel Peace Prize is higher, the winner of Nobel Peace Prize is more famous and have more authority."
6789,I do agree with your point that thinks about economy in the first hand. Capitalism is created for making money. People wanted freedom so capitalism has emerged so people have take the responsibility of creating it.
6791,I think you making good point but I disagree with your idea of 'safety of only his country' part. Trump is a future candidate of President of US. He have to put people in US on the first priority. He have to win some polls by doing so. What he is saying is offensive but choices will be done by people which is democracy.
6792,"I do not agree with your comment. Because, the man wear the costume of Chewbacca on purpose to make people interested."
6793,"What I felt was completely same as you. I could help but to laugh when I first saw this article. However, it can be a good spice for young people and give a positive influence on young people who do not participate in politics."
6794,"I really agree with you.I think Japanese is also more sensible than other countries.But I think only Ukrainian is not to blame for this situation. Their country has many ploblem.For example,Russia is always thinking and doing something to annex the part of the country.Ukrainian is also always scary that when the time come,Russia come to annex their land with military power.This stress makes Ukrainian mentally unstable.In addition,Ukraine was a socialist nation.So she couldn't do well economically and be given support from West Europe.It is cruel to say to behave like other developed European countries to the people under such situation."
6796,"I was surprised at this news as you, and I agree with you. Our reaction seems that Japan has a democracy."
6797,"I disagree your comment strongly. Because we have the liberty of politics, the man can be a candidate under the law."
6800,"I agree your comment strongly. Because if we are the same situation, we must stop coming the Islamic."
6805,"I think so too. In real, poor -person can not get the big chance. Japanese government should do some involvement."
6808,"I want to praise the brave man in Chewbacca. Although, the exception is pattern that Russia government participate in this action."
6811,"I think that it is a problem to be hard to cancel the difference between a rich person and the poor person. In the economic richness, the economic conditions of the child are similar to the economic conditions of the parent necessarily. If a parent lives a poor life, the child is easy to live a poor life, too. On the contrary, the child will live a rich life if a parent lives a rich life. It cannot be necessarily said that it becomes like this, but the probability becoming like this is high. I think that there are various factors for this fact. At first, one of the factors is education. The child can learn various things for 14 years from the elementary school to the university in Japan if a parent is rich. However, the child can receive education only until compulsory education if a parent is poor. The difference is seven years. The child who does not graduate from a university often gets work of the low-wage manual labor. However, they take work to use the head for because it is considered that a child receiving education well is a smart person. There will be surely the splendid person that I continue studying even if poor and do a company by oneself, and it is to the president. However, the example is extremely rare. Then, another factor includes an occupation. There are the story like the point and the common point, but the quantity of the salary is different in a poor person and a rich person every occupation. When people get a job unless I become an entertainer and an athlete, the interview official of the company often judges a person from scholastic ability. An able person and the incompetent person are distinguished with scholastic ability. The law may not necessarily match, but the custom in the world is so. Therefore the people who are not rich cannot learn it enough. And they get a low-wage occupation by the result that they cannot learn. Therefore they get only a low salary. After all it is necessary to expand education system to correct this difference. We must fix education system so that a difference of the educational background is not born of a rich person and a poor person. There is surely the occupation that everybody wants to do each. For the occupation that I want to do, as for a salary decreasing, there is no help for it. Without a salary, this is because he is substantial at a point realizing a dream. However, for economic conditions, I cannot allow to narrow width of the occupation choice unfairly. I think that it is necessary to widen education system and width of the occupation choice to correct the difference of economic conditions."
6813,"I think so too.Novel peace prize is very vague on election standard.This problem must be solved as soon as possible,and I hope that Novel peace prize changed the valuable prize."
6814,"I agree with Bill Gate's opinion . In capitalism, we have to make enormous efforts to stop climate change. Bill gave some example to solve this problem, I paid attention to the opinion related the rich and private sectors. Now It is a fact that they exhaust a lot of carbon dioxide. And most of them are in developed countries. So I also think developed countries should reduce CO2 emission positively. Without this, It is unreasonable to tell developing country to reduce CO2 emission. I also think carbon tax is nice idea. The rich in capitalism has very large power. So to get more money, there may be the person who does not mind climate change. And the poor may be unable to help with stopping climate change. So the system of carbon tax will become the key to stop climate change."
6816,"I think so, too. Indeed, many people may think that Obama destroys the world peace. However, Obama must have believed that the world become the wonderful world someday, and Obama always did actions for the world peace. I know that man often remembers people's bad action, but man forgets people's good action."
6817,"I agree with you. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical. An ordinary person is in them, too. For example does the person who would like to go to the United States of America to learn cause terrorism? I don't think so. So I can't agree to his opinion."
6819,"I agree with you corporation all over the world is very important to stand up to terrorism. Also Japan have to do something as one responsible country of international society. However, we have to look up the way to exterminate ISIS without violating human right"
6824,"The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that public have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all."
6825,It's difficult to solve this problem. Indeed a lot of i
6826,I agree with your opinion. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one.
6828,"It's difficult to solve this problem. Indeed if there is a lot of immigrants, many problem occur. However, the country get much labor force."
6829,"'Nobel peace prize winners should be people who are worth to be respected by many people in the world.' I really agree with you at this point.But who is worth to be respected? Nobel Prize is given to someone every year.In this system,selection committee should find the person if they don't want to give anyone,because it is their profession.I think this tradition should be abanodoned.If this prize lasts imperfectly,it is just a blasphemy to Nobel Prize.In Japan,there was a literary prize called 'Akutagawa Prize'. This Prize was said to be a gateway to success in the literary world in Japan. But in 2015,a comedian was given this prize.This made some of Japanese confused. Actually,comedian and novelist is similar type of profession in their work 'to make people laugh or happy with their technical use of words'. But the literature world and comedy world is different thing at all and should be distinguished clearly.It can be also seen as the tragedy caused by the profession to select prize winner every year.In Japan the literature world is going to the comedy level by selection committee.I think we should consider it again 'Who is deserve to wining a prize?'."
6833,"It's difficult problem to solve. Indeed Nobel Peace Prize become a mere name, I think but it is great award."
6835,"I agree with your opinion. We should search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on, and use alternative green energy."
6836,"I strongly agree with you. Though capitalistic private sectors prioritize stakeholder's benefit, it has made a very large contribution to the society. With economic benefit in mind, private sectors have developed technologies and products which has helped humankind to progress even more. In order to gain economic benefit, companies research and creates products which more superior than competitors and this competition benefits the society and consumers. But there will always be winning and losing in competitions. That's why the richer who holds more fortune has more chances to develops better products, thus stays winning in the competition. In my opinion capitalism may not be perfect but it has a lots of benefits. The energy sector is a very promising sector economically. The idea that capitalism cannot save us from climate change is logically weird. First in order to make benefit a company has to produce better quality, more economic, and easy to use products. With capitalistic way of thinking the idea of cheap, reliable and clean energy can soon be reality as energy companies will always try to make profits with its product."
6837,"I disagree with your opinion. I do not know her opinion. I think it is great that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens, so I agree this Nobel Peace Prize."
6842,"It was right that Trump is criticized. That is just a human discrimination and this is totally wrong not only as a politician but also as a human beings. Maybe there is no need to write human history, but I want to say human discrimination generates anything good. Many founders of big companies born in America are immigrants. Best example of Steve Jobs, founder of Apple. His father is immigrant from Syria. According to the news, more than 50% of founders of startups in Silicon Valley for this 20 years are immigrants. Immigrants are playing really important roll in American economy. And we have to think about Japan. Many people think Japanese people are tolerance for foreigners but I cannot totally agree with that. We have very cold aspect for stranger. Good example of that is 'hate speech'. Hate speech is kind of vent for economic differentiation. Economic differentiation is big problem, but human discrimination never justify. I think strongly that stop Trump to say like these human discriminations. He has giant power for making mass opinion."
6845,I agree with you. I think the question doesn't have an answer. It is not suitable for official exam's question.
6847,"I agree with you. I think his proposal should be criticized. It is filled with prejudice, and lead to more serious opposition. It is probable that IS are stimulated and it threatens the United States' national security. I can't believe that the proposal was made by a presidential candidate. His approval rating must have fallen. Because Muslims will not vote to him, and to begin with, the United States itself was founded by immigrants. Closing its border to Muslims will spoil its untiring efforts to oppose radicals. I think he no doubt disqualified himself from serving as a president."
6848,"I disagree with your opinion. I think terrorism by a certain radical Muslim is a very fearful one. Paris was also the very miserable situation recently. So his insistence can also be understood, but a Muslim isn't supposed to think everyone is same radical."
6849,"I am afraid of terrorism, too. I had thought Japan is a safe country, and we were not related to the terrorism by Islam. However, the incident that some Japanese were captured and killed by terrorists make our government and us conscious that we are connected. Thinking about own country and own life, I agree with Trump, but not all Muslims are evil. some of them should be allowed to immigrate."
6851,"I have the same ideas on some points, but I disagree with your main opinion. As you know, this question is for the official judicial examination, so it doesn't ask us 'Which do you help?', and ask people who will be lawyer/judge/public prosecutor if his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. As far as there is the law, this case is possible to occur, and successful candidates have to work with the law. So, this question makes sense and suit for the official judicial examination. In my opinion, China should delete or change the law for both person to be judged and person to judge."
6852,"Even the manager of the Internet and the technology company including Mark Zuckerberg of the Facebook CEO is interested in clean energy technology as well as Bill Gates. I searched green energy technology because I was interested in it. It is the energy that dose not exhaust the toxic substances such as carbon dioxide or the nitrogen oxide even if it bring about electricity and heat or that is extremely little discharge. For example, light of the sun, water power, the velocity of the wind, terrestrial heat, natural gas correspond and so on. It is said that it also points to an energy-saving technique at first followed by electricity generating system techniques such as the renewable energy, the accumulation of electricity technology last. It is necessary for a rich person like him to take the lead in helping economically to let a level to stop warming in the technology of these progress.In addition, I think that the government of developed country is required not only to make the technical development but also to make the system to impose a tax on an energy company and a user, and to change consciousness of the world. The good news is that not only China which is going to plan changing of the energy constitution but also Japan and each advanced countries pay attention to the clean technical supporting the clean energy which controls carbon dioxide emissions recently. If green energy attracts more attention as an investment, I think that research and development of it advance earlier. Bill Gates announced the establishment of Breakthrough Energy Coalition which invests as new clean energy technology on November 30, 2015. In Japan, there is the subsidy payment, so the spread of the renewable energy including photovoltaic power advanced, but it is delayed under the influence of the lower purchase price recently. On the other hand, in the United States, the high-tech company works on the new energy that includes the light of the sun positively. I think that deterioration and worsening global warming is responsible for self-centered developed country and capitalism. I think that they should make an effort for solution more in a front."
6856,"I agree with you. I was very surprised when I know this news. It will not take place in Japan. Star Wars is popular in Ukraine, so costume of Star Wars is suitable to attract attention. However I think that they should follow a law. The politician should give the nation security."
6857,"The peace prize that should make people warm feeling came to virtually let many people hold a question, when I knew this news for the first time, I was sad. But the power to give people the feeling of courage and the peace by there being a prize for peace is true, so I agree with the the continuation of the peace prize. Among the Nobel Prizes, especially Nobel Peace prize and Nobel Prize in Literature, the person who is hard to think that should win it generally may win it. In particular, the conferment to a politician is a question. I think that it is difficult to evaluate the politics and the peace when some time has not passed. A selection reason is vague, and there are many opinions to doubt the significance of existence, but I think that it is not useless because it can give the world an opportunity to think about peace by giving a prize. It is very complicated to evaluate peace because the peace has various definitions and a lot of objects. Therefore I think that the prize for peace should not be send with an political atmosphere of the time easily otherwise it may become a not good prize. I think that it should commend it after a fixed period of time passes after the death of the person and the approximate evaluation of the person was decided if they confer a prize on a politician. Recent Nobel Peace prize has considerably political implication, so the selection that anyone can understand is becoming difficult. Not only appreciating the past results, but also it may be given to send a message in hope of influence after receiving a prize like the future political situation. The politicians who were awarded a prize in the past because of political consideration are Former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, ex-President Kim Dae-Jung, ex-President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Albert Gore and President Obama. Peace and the justice are always unstable with vagueness. It has various values by being evaluated in a way of thinking, a viewpoint, and a situation. Based upon the foregoing, I think that it is understandable that a prize for peace has a pro and con. I think that the prize of the peace is more likely to be accepted willingly by many people without bringing about an argument if a rational judgment without deflection is done at a stage of the selection. As you say, I agree with the opinion the appropriate select criterion is necessary. The committee considers the significance that Nobel made this prize once again and I want it to be the blameless true peace prize."
6858,"When I read this article, I was surprised that to save girlfriend became your crime. However, it is difficult to decide which is better. People's life is equal, but if that choice turn weather family or others, most of the people may save family fast."
6859,"I don't think Trump's comments are totally wrong. Lots of people are afraid of terrorism and want to protect themselves and so do I. So I think he just wanted to claim the opinions that many people have but his way to protect his own country and the words that he used were unsuitable and racism. It is like a kid ignores his friend who he hates. I think he didn't try to think about Muslims and how to deal with terrorism but he just refused them, even not all of Muslims would be terrorists. I think it is one of the biggest problems in many countries. I'm afraid of terrorism like in Paris that could happen in Tokyo Olympic in 2020. I heard that IS attacked Paris because lots of people came from all over the world for COP21, so Tokyo could be the target. I think Japanese government has to think how to protect our country not like Trump's way. I don't know if Japanese people think that we are racists but I think we are because we refuse more immigrants than other countries. I don't think it is the best way to just refuse people from other countries but we need to think how to live together peacefully. If we could do this, I think we would have the solution of protecting our county from terrorism."
6861,"Before COP21 took place in 2015, most of developed countries had to reduce CO2 emissions and some developing countries tried to reduce them too. However, at COP21, it is decided that all countries have to cut carbon emissions. Also it is determined that developed counties will financially help developing countries. I think it was a great decision that all countries, included China, at least need to make an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Nobody can ignore the biggest problem, global warming since it is getting worth because of human being. I don't think global warming is going to be better soon but I think at least it will not get worth."
6862,"I have never watched Star Wars before so I can't understand what these characters are. However I was surprised that it was connected with politics. Some people commented that it should be free what people wear so the man should not be punished. I disagree with this opinion. Even it is democracy, there is common sense and the man has no common sense I think. That occasion was not a private party or a costume competition. I don't know if the man wanted to capture more people's attention, but his behavior was a shame to other politics. I learned that we should be able to tell the difference between right and wrong especially in the public occasion."
6863,"At first, I was really surprised that Chinese people made the question at such a serious exam like the National Judicial Exam. And it is ridiculous that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. We don't know who would be the first that we would save. It really depends on the situation especially in emergency situation. For example, in this article, one man said if his mother and his girlfriend in the burning building, he would definitely save his mother first. However, if his mother was still be able to walk very well and she was just by the front door and his girlfriend was in the furthest room from the front door, I think he would go to save his girlfriend first. It is okay that we discuss this question in private or not serious situation, but I thought it is very sad that many people have to choose one in the exam. We have no rights to judge people who said he or she would save his girlfriend or her boyfriend instead of mother. I really agree with the opinion in this article that people's lives are equal and the law should treat them equally. I think it is very inappropriate to ask many trainee lawyers and judges such question."
6864,I agree with your opinion. Our choice depends on not only blood relation ship but also in the situation where we are. I think nobody wants to compare the worth of our lives but I think some people might say that he would save his girlfriend instead of his mother because he likes his girlfriend better than his mother. But of course people's lives are equal so it is wrong that many trainee lawyers and judges are forced to answer such question.
6865,"I thought it is true that the question made people compare the value of people's lives. It means the person or the organization which made this question don't think that people's lives are equal. We might not save both of them, depending on the situation but we can't judge."
6866,"Some years ago, there were TV show named 'Harvard intensive class' (Japanese title: Harvard nekketsu kyoushitsu), which was hosted by some university professors and they gave some topic to audience and made audience think about that topic. I still remember one of their topic was 'if your train was about to crush into 5 people on the right side of the road and you found only one person on the left side, would you try to make train take left? in this situation, you would kill one person, but you would save five person. is it better? ' When I saw this news article, I suddenly recalled this program. I'm not sure what was the best answer, but professor on TV said it is the matter of whether we choose good result or good moral. I'm sure there is no answer and at the same time there are so many answers. Justice does not exist in only one way.and also what people think is Justice is not true justice sometimes. For example, I think the way of United States treat other countries especially communist countries is as if there are no justice without violence and war. It might be. but is it justice if it is filled with blood or death? what I wrote might get off the subject, but I wanted to say people should not decide what is 100 percent true justice and what is not. especially for the people who will judge people in future, they should not have one certain typical way of seeing something. if they label crime and justice, crime will not be understood why it is happened because people who judge it have 'typical cause and effect label' In order to grow good layer, this exam question should be changed. and also gender slight should be lost as well."
6867,"When I was in New Zealand there was a homo-sexual day and we did some activities to accept homo-sexual people like ATM on the street was re-painted to 'gAyTM'. For me that activity was so impressive because as you know Japan still take disadvantage on same gender marriage and many people sometimes do not accept homo-sexual people. but I thought, if we do some activities for them, it already recognized them as different. if we really think we should recognize them as normal, I mean same as others, we should not do anything special. We should only make a law for their comfortable lives. I do not disagree to spend tax on doing such kind of activities, but more people do some special things for homo-sexual people more they might feel uncomfortable."
6868,"When I saw this news, I partly feel happy because I am very bad at driving but at the same time I feel sad because these days I gradually start enjoying driving. I think driving is kind of sports or exercise. I know it occurs so many death accident, but people have been driving for a long years and it also became our culture. people compete their skill of driving. sometimes boys tried to drive their car really cool in front of girls. I liked such kind of culture. of course non-driver cars will bring us safer more comfortable future, but if everything make automatic, people will lose their own way and lose competence."
6869,"I have belonged to the Faculty of Law Department of Law and I learn the laws, such as the Constitution, civil law and criminal law. The civil law and criminal law among them is easy to relate to us. Court give a variety of judgement by the situations in the case of performing the trial using the civil law. For example, judgement is changed by how many circumstances can the victim know in the fraud. But criminal law adopts basically nulla poena sine lege and court can't give a crime not to be written in the provision. Chinese criminal code adopts nulla poena sine lege too. Then, Japanese court give the judgement like above case in the Chinese criminal law? As a result of the search, the case taken up greatly wasn't exist but some people said it was exist. The people has a variety of opinion about a judgement court have ever give. But, even if we must help our mother to obey the criminal law, they are human. I am a civil service examination to become a government worker and some the problem of a examination let me answer what judgement the accused should accept. I don't want the problem like which case I accept a judgement."
6870,"After terrible terror happened in France, many Muslims post their picture which they wrote 'I am a Muslim but I am not terrorist' on Facebook. I totally understand for the people who lost their family or friends by terror, all Muslim must be seen as killers, but in this terror, victims are not only people killed by terror. Muslims are also victims because they lost their home or social states because of some terrorist which is only a part of Muslim. racism only brought racism and terror only brings anger and revenge. I would not say I agree Mr tramp one hundred percent but I partly understand what he wanted to tell us."
6871,"I think it is a great challenge to capture many people's attention about gay. This is one of the biggest topic and trend all over the world nowadays. As you know, same sex marriage is now legal in all states in the US. Before that, only a few states allowed same sex marriage so lots of people came to the states to marry. Many people were waited this so there were lots of celebrations everywhere. And it was a big trend that Facebook users changed their profile picture to one with a rainbow filter to celebrate the new law in the US. According to these trends, many people are very positive about gay. It is very delightful change that we are allowed to have the equally right to love someone even if he or she is the same sex and allowed to open it. This change is spreading in many countries like the US and European countries, but I think gay people still hard to live to open that they are gay. Recently, it is getting better environmental for gay people than before. For example, we see more famous people on TV who are gay and sexless clothes are trend now. However, there are still discriminations and I think there are more discriminations in Japan than the US. One of may gay friends told me that he can tell that he is a gay to his American friends but he doesn't want to tell Japanese friends because he is afraid of a prejudice. I think nothing wrong to love someone and they should open it like straight people do. I hope Japan will be the comfortable place for gay people too."
6872,"Even the nuclear plants make huge amount of energy, I want to keep is shut down. Because there is one nuclear plant near from my hometown. Some people say that we can't live without nuclear power but I don't think so. I think there are many ways to produce energies and Japanese have potential to find some new ways because Japanese are very cleaver."
6873,"I didn't know that potatoes could be energy. That will be the great way because it will not emit harmful gas or something bad for human being. This method might be used in the US, however, I don't think we have much potato in Japan to generate enough energy. But I think this kind of way to make energy is useful."
6874,"I agree with you deeply. Who should be saved in this situation? I think the only answer is that it depends on the situation of their relationship. The relationship between the son and mother is not always deeper than the girl friend. And the condition of the two ladies does not expect from this document. So, I also think that this question is ridiculous."
6875,"It is a trendy topic in Japan now because the three biggest car companies, Toyota, Nissan and Honda, are making self-driving cars and Prime minister Abe tried to get in the car, which Toyota invented. I watched this news recently and it said that they would be running on the public roads in 5 years. However I'm not excited that it will be real. I feel like everything will be robot like the stuffs in the hotel's front and these self-driving cars. I'm sure that Japan have great technologies and I'm proud of them but it is getting too much. I'm wandering who have responsibilities when car accidents occur. I feel people no longer are needed and we will not have to work. It will make people more lazy and I'm afraid of people will get foolish because we don't have to work, perhaps we will not need to study. Also I'm afraid of loosing our tradition and culture. Japanese technologies can be our culture but I want to keep out culture which has protected for long time."
6876,"I have a same opinion. This is a serious ethical problem. To take this exam, the new lawyers are decided. But, this question cannot answer unless they paralyze their fair feeling."
6877,"I agree with you. Before I read this article, I research for the terrorism in Tunisia. That hospital which is broken by American aerial bombing, which was the only place to solve the medical problems in that area. So, we can not imagine how it gives a big damage of the people who live in that place. In this accident, many nurses and pharmacists and patients are dead. They lost not only the lives but also the important knowledge. I am really sorry for them. At the same time, I feel the deep anger in my heart. So, I agree with you from bottom of my heart."
6878,"Changing the national flag is a big deal since the national flag is a part of its county like its people. I thought it is better to keep their current national flag at first, because people all over the world can recognize that is New Zealand's flag. However, I can understand what Mr. Key thinks. New Zealand's national flag has a flag of the UK and it shows that New Zealand was a former British colony. So he wants to show that his county is already independent and no longer needed their supports. And I think if NZ could change its national flag, it could show its power and protect their prides. So I became to think that it is okay to change its national flag."
6879,"I agree with you. I also think that China did many bad thing for earth, that was wrong. I noticed that my opinion is always too effected by the social media. In Japan, the media pick up the many news that the image of China worse. Probably, there are many reason for example, the political thing, the economy thing and the historical thing. We don't understand each other yet so the relationship between China and Japan is not so good. So I think that we should know that the social media's way of inform for us perhaps does not have the fair view point. In addition to this problem, I felt in Germany that the action for the environment have already started in many country. Last month, I went to Germany. In that country, there are so many solar power generations and wind power generations. I was really surprised the number. So, in Japan, I want the government to do more about the environment quickly."
6880,"In addition to my opinion, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, also have a power that the change the individual mind in the world. His opinion is enough effective,I think."
6881,I think that his opinion is natural as a representation of the United States. But I worry about the goal of the refugees. Where should they go? The extreme policy can be a new trigger of the bigger terrorism. So I really concern it.
6882,"I really agree with you, especially, this part, racism only brought racism and terror only brings anger and revenge. Now, people in the world maybe think that the culture or the religion of Muslim are so dangerous. But as you say, it is not true. Their culture or religion itself is good. The terrorists are only small part of them. Many normal Muslims want us to understand this point of view, probably. And, we should not decide our opinion by one fact. We always should see the thing from some perspectives."
6883,"I have a little different opinion with you. But as you say, there are so many refugees in this world and we cannot judge which person will be dangerous or not. So, many country ban accepting them. But the refugees can be a new labor force? In this situation, it is difficult, I think. Maybe the countries especially Christianity will not accept as a labor"
6887,"I really agree with this sentence. 'Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter'. Of course, the characters are famous all over the world. There are many fans in Japan. Now, we can see everything throughout the Internet, so the sensational news like this will spread quickly. I think it is not bad thing, however, there are no sympathy feelings. So I think that is a problem."
6890,"In addition to my former opinion, I didn't know that the system of becoming a lawyer is really different from the country. In Japan, the bar exams yield the least number of successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam."
6892,"I am in favor of that say Bill Gates. Rich countries will first take the initiative to when it is necessary to solve the environmental problem I think. Other countries doing so also will imitate the country. More specifically, I think it should be much higher the price of coal, which is one of the causes of more global warming."
6893,"I have thought that Nobel peace prize was noble but according to this article, it may be wrong. Nobel peace prize was given to some people who did not active so peaceful. I think people who did violent or cruel thing like bombing should not be prized. It is little dangerous to select people to prize by only one surface. All behaviors of the person should be considered, and then, they should be given the prize."
6894,"I think the police arrest by this incident is reasonable. In the influence election of the country in the future, I think that you use the character of the famous movie violates greatly to fairness of the election. It would become unnecessarily increase the people to vote without considering the policy."
6895,"I think your idea is better ways to Nobel peace prize. To build peaceful world, working for disarmament and against militarism is essential things. I think there are some people who activated to build peace world but if they did extreme violent movement can not be given this peace prize. Little violent movement is needed to build peace world so some making violent movements have to be allowed but too cruel one or too many violent actives do not have to be allowed."
6896,"I agree with your opinion.I think that US is one of the biggest country in world, so the country's candidate should all country's happiness and safety."
6897,"I don't know why the criticism of Donald Trump was far from unanimous. He is not a politician. But he is a famous businessman. So he is good at attracting people's attention by using aggressive and discriminative words. I feel it is nonsense. At first, his controversial statements attracted media's attention, because it was interesting temporary. But he repeated so much such a statement. I am afraid of hearing his statement. I think there are a lot of people feel so sad about his discriminative and outrageous proposal. He criticized about police of Paris without citing any evidence. It was very rude. His main concrete proposal is to block all Muslims from entering the United States. To be afraid of terrorism is natural. But the Muslims who have no connection with terrorism will be very poor. To block those people is very big discriminative and evil act. I wonder why he cannot think about those people. And I think such an aggressive words will stimulate ISIS. I think only to block Muslims cannot prevent terrorism. The problem is not so simple. If he will be the president of the United States, a lot of people in the world have a doubt about the united States. I do not want the United States to be such a future."
6898,I agree with you.Mr Trump confuse ordinary people with terrorists.It is so dangerous because he doesn't divide religion on terrorism.I scared him.
6899,I don't think that his offensive speech was his strategy. I think his opinion is selfish and he just takes care about his country.
6900,"The news difficult for me. The person wear full-body suit like chewbbaca.That is strange thing and the article talk a lot of things connecting with Sterwars.I confuse real thing on fiction. So,the news difficult for me."
6901,"This news is very interested for me. Therefore I research this troubles. The Star Wars character Chewbacca has been dragged before a court in Odessa, in perhaps the most surreal episode in local elections across Ukraine that have been both hotly contested and rife with dirty tricks. The man inside the costume was fined 170 hryvnia for the 'administrative offence' of not being able to produce identification documents. A statement posted on the official Instagram account of the Ukrainian police read: 'Nothing unusual here, just Chewbacca detained for being without documents while driving Darth Vader to the elections in Odessa. The Sith Lord has already claimed this was illegal as Chewbacca is his pet and general servant and thus does not require documents.' Police had earlier dragged 'Chewbacca' from a polling station and put him in a van after accusing him of disrupting proceedings. The person in the costume said he had been there to support Darth Vader, who was attempting to vote. I was very surprised this topics."
6903,"This news story made me surprised very much. This is the first time I heard that candidates wore costume of character. I thought that the man disguised as that character because he wanted to say he was clever like this character at first because I did not know about STAR WARS. So I searched about STAR WARS and the character Chewbacca on the Internet. Surprisingly, Chewbacca cannot speak and can understand only basic language. They are misunderstood by people as savage animals because of their appearances. I was not able to find out the advantages of disguising himself as Chewie. But I consider that he only wanted to gather people's attentions by the costume. I think disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. Some people might decide who to vote only because of their costume. Candidates should gather votes by their own manifesto. And people have to make decision who to vote by deeply considering about not only their surface but also their manifesto and thinking or behavior before the election."
6904,"I have the both opinions of agreement and disagreement with Donald J. Trump. My reason for agreement is that I think many Muslim immigrants will enter the United States and its government cannot deal with them in the aspect of welfare, such as house and insurance. On the other hand, my reason for disagreement is that it is possible for Muslim immigrants to cause terrorism in the United States. I think that the government should be more careful when it decides something important."
6905,"I disagree with you. I don't think that his speech is strategy. In my opinion, he dislikes Muslim because of terrorism and cruel action, so he only represents his thought."
6906,I agree with your opinion. The person who costumed as Chewbacca did no prohibited action but his action brought bad effect to the election. Election is not event which candidates gather people's attention by their costume. Candidates should show people their manifesto and their earnest will to the politics. I agree with your idea that the statement 'as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet.' is too insincere. More faithful person is necessary to go into politics.
6907,I agree with your idea. The news story like a joke but it isn't joke.Election is very important event so I think they should think much more and rethink their idea that vote the candidate.
6908,"In deed, your opinion that Chewie is not a clever character, but I think its costumed man chose the character because it was like mascot character and lovely. Also, Star Wars is one of the world widest movies, so he chose this character, I felt. I wish the future that young people are also attracted to elections comes."
6910,"It is difficult the simulation. I can't answer the question. I think that if I choose one,I regret the answer. So ,the question is so difficult for me."
6911,"I think that it is so difficult question to answer. Many people think that both their own mother and girlfriend will be safe is the best way. In the article, there is an idea like that. ''I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own,' one man reasoned' (quoted from the article) This is understandable. Simply, this question is too extreme speculation. I can not choose which way is better , if really I were in that kind of situation. Law students are also same. However wise in the terms of law, it is difficult to answer and to think from the sight of lawyer. This kind of question is too difficult, but I think it is meaningful think this question seriously and consider over this question from a lot of sights."
6912,I almost agree with you but I have only one point which I am not for. This costuming behavior is humor but not less reliable. Candidates should not make laugh in such ways. The point is remaking the statue of Lenin to Darth Vader is sign of people's longing for new world. I do not think so. I think people who remade the statue did such action for only own satisfaction.
6913,I think Bill Gates's idea that rich countries consider the solutions to the environmental problems is good. I agree with Bill Gates. I also think rich countries should be the first to consider this problems. I hope that this problems are solved completely.
6914,I think he is very bad man. I think he should not be a politician. This news is very horrible. The US government should this US's future.
6915,I agree with your opinion. I think America and any countries should understand that not all Muslims are violent. More careful policy is need.
6916,I agree with your point that Novel prize includes individual thoughts. I think that make the differences of the value of each prize.
6917,"I agree with your idea. The question's answer change the situation for example both people's damaged,age and location. Lawyers should treat equally people's life. The simulation is useful for lawyers because they can train themselves."
6918,"I agree with your opinion. It is natural that people are afraid of terrorism by Islamic estates. But we should think about all people's safety. I did not know about Tom Brokaw. After reading your opinion, I thought I should try to understand more them. I can do to try to understand is very small things. For example, to watch news and to read books. But it is different that I do not all about things about them or not. If I watch news on TV, I feel the happening is no connection with my world. But the thought is wrong. We have to think about all incident connect with our world. Always we should deal like ours thing."
6919,"When I read this article, I was very surprised. It is unbelievable to ask such question in national compulsory test. I have ever heard this question by my friends and it was interesting to think about the answer. My friend said that she asked this question to her boyfriend and he said he rescue his mother first on the spot so she quarrel with him. I think this question is interesting to debate with friends, but this is not worth asking in official exam. This is proper for asking with friends or in psychological test. This question have no correct answer so it can not to be graded. If the right answer is fixed, this is immoral question because people's lives are all equal. Deciding order to rescue at fire is wrong. In China, people who enter the judicially or legal profession must pass this test but I think this question is no relation to a trial. On the other hand, sexual problem is serious in China. This question should be rewritten to gender equality form. China is too thoughtless in various aspects so they should be more careful to decide the question in national exam and sexual expressions."
6920,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that life of each person has same importance. We should not think which life of person is more important than others. Although the answer of this question is controversial, people have to notice that everyone has equal level importance of life."
6921,"I agree with your opinion. I also think that Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded when genuine peace occurred. Like in Tunisia, there is no true peace in the country. Thus, they should not be awarded for their movement."
6922,"I disagree with your opinion. Surely, not all the Muslim has violent idea, and some of the Muslim needs a safe country. However, the possibility of the danger by immigration has become higher since the terror in Paris happened. I can understand Trump's idea."
6923,"I feel sad to read this article, because the people who took that exam had to answer this question which do not have correct answer. People's life is equal. The order to rescue people's life should not be decided before. When we faced such a difficult situation, we have no time to choose the person who are rescued. But it is sure that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones is not correct. This answer will be changed by the situation. My image about China, Chinese people respect their parents so much. But I feel woman's social status is still low position. About the sexist nature of the question, I feel sad. Because it is the outcome of the delay of the social advance of the woman. I think woman in China should insist more their right and social status. If the way of thinking of people changes, such a question will disappear from a test."
6924,"I agree with your opinion. I think candidates have to change their clothes which is appropriate to the occasion. The reason why is simple, we can not respect the person who wears a black tie in the wedding. The clothes have the way which represent the situation one person is included. If we are in the party of wedding, we have to wear white tie. In your comment, one student in your class said like that, nowadays, it is freedom what kind of clothes a person chooses to wear. However, it is definitely different from the custom , I think. Please don't misunderstand what I want to say. I would not like to tell you about the way of choosing your suit clothes but want you to know what is important. The person who have stable sensation gives people good impression. I think except the people who is perverse, almost all usual people tend to like the person who is kind or has common sense."
6925,"I agree with you. This question is too ridiculous and no need to ask in national test. I think the best answer is to try to rescue both mother and girlfriend. It is very difficult to make decision that who to save on priority and it have no means for people. Make people who take the test think about to rank human lives is foolish idea. I think there is more important thing to ask in the test before asking such a question, for example, sexist problem."
6926,"Japanese economical problem is serious nowadays. Japanese government's opinion is Japan is gradually raising in terms of economics. But the export industry does not increase though the yen become weak. Japanese depression has continued since about 2014. I think Japan can not recovery this serious economical situation easily. The Abe Government treats the rich over the poor, so that I can not be optimistic about Japanese future. Japan should also consider about environmental problem, global warming. Each countries tries to soften global warming by decreasing CO2 emission. I searched about China's CO2 emission problem. Although many people think China is the largest CO2 emitting country, actually China CO2 emission per person is less than that of America and European country on official data. I wonder it is 'real' situation. I found that China burns up 17% more coal than official announce. This is intentional error of Chinese government. According to this fact, I understand why there are some problems like air pollution and low CO2 emit rate per person in China. This dishonest acts can not be turned a blind eye to. I think all countries in the world should think deeply about CO2 emission and global warming problem. Japan also have serious CO2 emission problem. CO2 emission have raised 50 ton in 10 years from 1999 to 2009. 1250 ton became 1300 ton in 2009. This is large increasing. TOYOTA has plan to cut CO2 emission. TOYOTA's new vehicle can reduce 22% of CO2 emission by 2020, Tokyo Olympic year. And TOYOTA has new Mexico plant in which hydrogen power and wind power are in use for 40% of CO2 emission. I hope these reducing action bring good result for environmental problem."
6928,"If I am American citizen, I do not support Donald Trump. I think his idea for Muslims is too selfish. All people may be have fear for terrorism and they want not to be victims of IS. But refugees come from Syria at the risk of their lives. We all have to rescue and save their lives by accepting to our countries. I know there are a lot of problem of receiving many refugees and I think we can not find good ways for this problem without limiting the number of accepting. But Trump's idea is only for Muslims. This is inhuman idea. Not all Muslims are criminal people and this is a kind of racism. I think severe entry formalities can keep the terrorism away."
6929,I think so too. Not all Muslims are terrorists and they are also victims of the Paris terror. Only few Muslim people are extremely cruel but most of Muslims are normal people. They have their families and their lives. I watched the refugee situation in TV today. That was very severe. Refusing their entering because they are Muslims is immoral.
6930,I agree with you. There are few countries which can accept refugees. Germany is one of the most positive country about entering refugees but I think the capacity is limited. I anticipate Germany will become full and have to shut border in near future. We need more countries to accept. Japan should receive more immigrants.
6931,"I agree with your opinion. Needless to say, the Nobel Peace Prize is great award which has long history. However, we should not forget that the Noble Peace Prize is made and operated by human."
6932,"At first, I think about 'peace' before you think about the Nobel Peace Prize.According to the Wikipedia in English, 'Peace is harmony between different social groups that is characterized by lack of violence or conflict behaviors, and the freedom from fear of violence. Commonly understood as the absence of hostility and retribution, peace also suggests sincere attempts at reconciliation, the existence of healthy or newly healed interpersonal or international relationships, prosperity in matters of social or economic welfare, the establishment of equality, and a working political order that serves the true interests of all.' It define 'peace' finely in the Wikipedia in English . Secondly, I think about 'Nobel Peace Prize'. According to the Wikipedia in Japanese, 'the Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to a person or organization that was the largest and best contribution for friendly relations between nations or reduction and abolition of armaments or holding peace conference'. However, these days, the members of selection committee seem have expand this definition. I can't understand some points. For example, 'reduction and abolition of armaments'. Do we think it lead the world to peace? Some countries will be attacked relentless from the enemy if they reduce the armaments easily. Such a vague definition is a factor of recent criticism. In particular, I think it is a quite problem to award the Nobel Peace Prize to politicians. Politics is for their country and even has likelihood to have a bad influence on foreign countries, for example, Henry Alfred Kissinger. In such a situation, we can't possibly realize 'peace'. In contrast, other Nobel Prize, in particular science, is easy to discuss. If a scientist get science make progress greatly, that's a good thing. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should be removed."
6934,"I agree with your opinion in the hope of democratization of Ukraine. When I knew this news for the first time, I have only the impression of an interesting story, but in fact, there was a deep political background. This case in itself becomes the mere funny story, but political and geographical problems of Ukraine are the complicated and serious circumstances that tormented Ukrainian people for many years. It is true that the act of this false Chewbacca did the annoying social act that disturbed the election activity, but it is also a fact that many people have a chance to pay attention to Ukrainian political problems like you and me. To become democratic truly for Ukraine, the government, which can changes politics is above all important. Therefore, I want there to push forward election smoothly for next time. In addition, I am glad if they play an active part in the pleasant scenes such as Star Wars new movie exhibitions, not the serious situation such as the election activity in the future."
6936,"I also have the idea that a majority of respondents from seven countries said, so I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. This economic system is the lack of the equality and the society of competing. I think the equality is important to solve the problem. But socialist economics have demerits. I have no idea and the knowledge about the economy, but all the people including me have to learn the economy and try to solve the problem."
6937,I also think this question is too ridiculous.This question does not have the correct answer. We should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. People's lives are equal.
6938,"I do not agree with your opinion. Certainly,it is difficult for me to save both of them. But I can't be businesslike about a matter like you and think. When I have to make a decision which to save, I will upset. It is not good, but I can't choose which to save."
6939,I agree with your opinion. I think that we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism too. Now companies are growing by profit supremacy. Companies strive to lower the cost of goods. And Subcontractors strive too for that. So there is no room for alternative energy enters in the market!
6940,"I am opposite your opinion. I felt the point is not that in this article. It is more important than to save mother or girlfriend that the question exists only for men. We have to recognize that seriously. We have recognized the wrong. Over the recent years, the Japanese society has come to gender equality. However, it has become a serious problem in the India. For example, situations such as marriage of women would buy with the money. Our eyes have to look at the world not only Japanese society."
6941,"I don't think so. It is unique! When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement."
6942,"Humorous people is in any countries and it is also true that there is humorous people who are pulling the society. However, humorous people must choose the time and place when they do humorous action. This news is a bad example. Ukraine has been paid attention to the Crimean peninsula problem in recent years by many countries. In addition, the Ukrainian people will also began to be interested in politics greatly. Territorial problem is very easy for root of problem to become deep. Especially, in this case, it even easier because Ukrainian opponent is power, Russia. In addition, Ukrainian civil war was severe, many civilians were sacrificed in this civil war. According to domestic politics becoming confused, anyone in Ukraine would want to decide the politics in their will. Maybe citizens also thought such a thing in unified local elections.However, this incident occurred.I can easily understand the anger of the high-minded citizens. When important things affecting their future, for example, the election, are run, if playful guys appear, they won't stand. When I looked the beginning of this incident is from the Internet, I still amazed. There is people thinking the stupid thing in any country.Certainly all humorous man isn't bad. People who have humor tends to be a good leader. I think Junichiro Koizumi is a good example.However, the humor at this time is not only just play. I want them to consider their future more. Aside from this topic, Chewbacca is the fellow that act together with the Han Solo of the light side. But I think why you are rooting for Darth Vader of the dark side."
6943,"I think this problem is very serious and now, the people of Islamic in the world receive eyes of prejudice. I became very sad when I watched the news about this. I researched this news more. The Muslim community in the UK has been 'disgusted' by the idea of a possible ban on Muslim girls and young women from wearing veils in public places. Home Office Minister Jeremy Browne says the government should consider the ban. 'We should be very cautious about imposing religious conformity on a society which has always valued freedom of expression,' a Liberal Democrat Minister told The Telegraph. 'But there is genuine debate about whether girls should feel a compulsion to wear a veil when society deems children to be unable to express personal choices about other areas like buying alcohol, smoking or getting married,' Browne said. 'That would apply to Christian minorities in the Middle East just as much as religious minorities here in Britain,' The debate comes after Birmingham Metropolitan College changed its rules last week in an unprecedented move. It's important that the debate will held many times. We should not have prejudice about Islamic people by only the image of terrorism by IS."
6944,"I researched. The category of this question. It becomes 'Crime of Omission (crime of omission)'. The crime that is realized by not performing an artificiality act of the 'uniformity with the crime of omission according to Koujien. There is it with 'When I make it plain, it is a crime to happen by not having done something. For example, it is a plain example to let you result in death without mother giving a baby rice. In addition, I include that I give another person it in silence while knowing it with the drink which harm enters. Chinese Ministry of Justice disclosed an answer later. The answer to this question was 'mother'. According to Ministry of Justice, It is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that it is imposed on the person whom I chose when I help her for the crime by what 'Crime of non-action' that is nothing did. I receive questions and the answer to this problem, and there is various opposition on the net. The problem to choose person either other as with mother at the time of 'emergency is funny. 'According to the 'law, the son has a duty to help mother. However, time when there is jeopardized another person is not written down in the law in the same way there. 'There is the 'woman anywhere. But mother is only one. I surprised this news. The way of thinking in China is not good. These examination questions vs. did it, and had a question, and how long would there be the confused student? If I will solve this problem, I am confused and will not understand to hear the answer either."
6945,"I read this article that I was very surprised and sympathized his opinion. I interested in His idea so, I research his opinion and idea. The emigrant policy of the Republican primary candidate Donald cards of the property tycoon is the forced repatriation. The cards which upset a republican primary election by a discrimination against illegal immigrant remark took the new material. It is one to found 'a forced repatriation corps' which sends back an illegal immigrant staying in the United States to the own country forcibly. 'A product sends back a forced repatriation corps by a humanitarian method'....... I talked about the cards which appeared for a news program of MSNBC this week when you must stop that millions of people wanted to come to the United States and were going to enter the country illegally. As for the cards, what kind of it; the details did not show whether was organized. For example, being the executive officer of the civilian whether you are constructed in a United States Armed Forces corps or being the vigilance committee of a volunteer patrolling in the Mexico border. The emigrant policy of cards created a pro and con so far. Newscaster of the FOX news, building O'Reilly criticize the emigrant policy of cards to build the huge wall for expenditure of Mexico in the border several months ago when not realistic. When FOX slandered oneself, the cards fought back.Two people clashed with each other again this week. I praised the policy of the Eisenhower government which the cards picked up an illegal immigrant from Mexico on the track by the televised debate of the Republican Party candidate whom FOX business network sponsored and arrested all at once. Because a way is violent, and this policy (the speech 'wet Bach' who pointed at a Mexican emigrant did not use the cards because it was considered to be discriminatory expression now either) called 'the wet support operation' caused the dead person, there is the viewpoint to hit human rights violations now. O'Reilly pressed you 'to have been the violent way that kicked an emigrant (as for the wet support operation) back in the own country'.John mosquito Jeb Bush of the calling at entreated cards to stop antagonizing a Hispanic qualified voter of in other Republican tickets. When 'the Hilary camp was only pleased to clap a hand as for Jeb if I made such a remark (the Democratic Party) ,' I persuaded you. Mosquito chic も 'let patronize it, and leave it abroad, and everybody knows it (in illegal immigrants) when is a ridiculous argument'. I argued, it was not the argument of adult to cards."
6948,"I am against this test about the law of China. I think that it is strange that, of two acts to give priority to life of his mother or that of girlfriend, one becomes the criminal act, and the other is justified. It is not the figure which it should be of the law to regulate that you should give priority to the life of parents over other relatives and lovers. It is not the law that is suitable for the modern nation. In addition, I was surprised that a test to give such a nonsense question was 'one of the most exacting national tests in China'. It is not a bad thing to choose which choice, because the choice is decided by sense of values and subjective differences in each person. Therefor, the law should provide a flexible environment to accept the way of thinking of various people because the law should be existence not only to regulate the action of people, but also give freedom to the nation. The traditional custom and way of thinking are various in each country and area and local culture should be respected basically, but as a student learning law, I think that it is not good that such an irrational law custom exists. I want this old custom to be more flexible and rational."
6949,"I think it is good thing the richest man in the world, like Bill Gates to use money to invest new green energy. Because we should change our resource. If we continue to use fossil fuel, CO2 continue to be increased and the resource is gone. To avoid that situation, we have to make new energy. To do so, we need a lot of funds. Thanks to Bill Gates act, American people will be able to notice the importance of changing resources. In Japan, we almost depend on nuclear energy. It is sure that nuclear energy emit CO2 less than fossil fuel. But using that power is really dangerous. Some people in Japan protest to use nuclear energy. But now, we have no energy resource which can be substitute for nuclear energy. To develop more new energy, like a green energy is the most important thing. It is sure that to develop new energy we need much more money. But this will be advantageous in the long run. According to this article, a majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. I agree with this statement. Because in Japan, children who are born in rich family can go to crime school and enough education to go to the United State or private school. After that they can get the high salary good job because they have good school career. It will continue to their children as well. But the poor cannot have enough money to be educated. After that, they take a low salary job. In my opinion, that is a majority pattern in Japan. I do not well other country's which are in capitalism. But those country may be so. I want to believe that 'The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last'. But it will be difficult to be so as now. I can only to believe my country will try to make the country which can give hope to next generation."
6950,"When I saw the headline of this article, I was really interested because Bill Gate is one of the people whom I respect. I read an article about him before, which said 'Bill Gate said 'what the difference between first class and economy class in the plane. whichever arrive to the destination at the same time' so he normally don't use first class.' when I read it, I was so impressed and knew Bill Gate is wonderful person. Even when I read this article I felt respect towards him again. Environmental problem is getting more and more serious. it is true that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies and private sector should reconsider about their attitudes towards to the environments. But I really do not agree the idea like we should give punishment to the country which break the rules of environment. Some countries and people blame china so much but what makes china polluted country? I think definitely it is because of us. If china dismiss their factory, how can people create productive and how can we get goods? so many things are 'made in china' and thanks to this, we can get productive in cheap price. before blaming china, we should reconsider about how 'we' can solve this problem. It is not a problem of only big countries. All country should corporate because we live on the same planets."
6951,"when I read this article, what I thought first was like 'If some Japanese parties pretend to be some character and they do campaign I would definitely go to vote and voting rate must be up' but in this case, I think they do too much. In another news article, I read that they change their ID for pretending to the character. For example, when Darth Vader went to the election place, he showed ID written 'Darth Ivanovich Vader' and he was rejected. I also read seven of the Darth Vaders, Yoda and Chewbacca were nominated for parliament by the Internet Party, which champions technological advancement and demands an end to corruption. As I wrote on the top of this comments, it must be good way to attract people but it is difficult to find out how they are serious for politics. Also their face is hidden by their costume, so we cannot see their expression, which is not good for campaign. I love star wars like many people but it does not mean I can support their party."
6952,I totally agree your opinion. how can put priority to human right? everyone must be equal and we cannot decide until we are putted in that situation. it is not matter what they chose and no one should be blame even that kind of situation was happened.
6953,"I totally agree your opinion. we should focus on what he did rather than what he said. I also read the article which said secretary of novel peace prize regrets that they gave novel prize to Obama and said 'No Nobel Peace Prize ever elicited more attention than the 2009 prize to Barack Obama,' we might should not blame what he did because as I wrote in my comment it is not everything what we saw, but it is definitely wrong that Obama got peace prize."
6954,"Today, some environmental problems has become a very big problem. And global warming has become the most important problem to be solved among them. Meanwhile, Paris agreement was adopted last year and approach to the world of environmental problems began to proceed to a new step by it. Paris agreement is a framework with a legal binding force since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997. Then, what kind of goals does Japan has set ? The goal is 'reducing CO2 26 percent from 2013 to 2030'. The main method is two. The first one is using renewable energy. Renewable energy is 'the energy acknowledged to be able to permanently used as an energy source' and solar and wind power are two of the examples. If they use renewable energy, they use no more natural resources and a new environmental problem won't happen. However, there are also weak points. Solar power and wind power generation is likely to be affected by the weather and geothermal power generation is likely also to be affected by condition of earth. In addition, equipment costs are high and there aren't many environments that you can set up a power plant. The second is nuclear power generation. This is a method to evaporate water to use the energy generated by the fission of uranium and generating power by rotating a turbine with steam. It doesn't emit CO2 at all. It is the best advantage. It is also possible to reuse the fuel. It is friendly for the environment. However, this also has a weak points, too. As you know, eye to the public of nuclear power plants became severely since Fukushima nuclear power plant is misconduct at the east Japan great earthquake. Therefore, it is difficult supporters to nuclear power plant ally public opinion and safety issues always haunt the administration. It is great the flow of world is heading for the direction to reduce CO2. In particular, it is more great more celebrities such as Bill Gates has called. There is progressing rapidly technological revolution in the world, but the consideration of environmental problems is essential in that case. It was warm winter in Japan last winter and the average temperature is rising year by year. You should work to reduce CO2 emissions while all countries are collected because the Paris agreement was adopted recently."
6956,"I definitely against your opinion. It is obvious that Confucianism is very old. Confucianism was completed in 13th. Although contemporary philosophy keeps evolving in 21th. Is there concept of equality between the sexes or comprehension to LGBT? Of course not. Actually, there are some important lesson - for example, we should look after our parents well. However, we can't 'put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism'. I seem that almost Chinese don't think it is a virtue to help their mother with victim of their girlfriend now. It is impossible to keep pace with modern society while they put Confucianism on the central part of their values. So I think it might be better if they get the new ideology with the essence of Confucianism."
6957,"I agree with your opinion which all country should share information about pollution and the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. I also didn't know about the problem of China about pollution, even Japan as well. I feel embarrassed. I feel I should know and understand more seriously about our energy and pollution problem. Japan should imitate good countries which success to decrease greenhouse emission, like German and the United Kingdom."
6958,"I think that it is difficult to praise or to not praise the fact a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia got the Nobel Prize. At first, I think it is so great that Tunisia became the democracy society, but I changed my opinion which praises Tunisia. The reason why is the reality of Tunisia is far from the democracy. I read a column written about this Tunisian revolution last week. It is named 'The process of Tunisian democratization.' in Japanese. The author name is Keiko Takaki. In the column, I understand that Tunisian government really made effort to run democracy society. At first, the first election of Tunisia is thought to come to the failure by foreign countries, but it is different from their foresight. The voting rate was much higher than their foresight. I think that they can say that election was success, but I want to say the local situation is far from the democracy society. Public peace and order has been getting worse after the Tunisian Revolution. I have seen a lot of comments in the internet or columns or articles which shoes the nowadays getting worse of Tunisian public security. I think still now, it is not finished the process of becoming democracy society of Tunisia. Many people in this country feel unrelieved, because they do not imagine what would happen from now. I think it is necessary more time to be a real democracy society for Tunisia. In the pattern of Japan, it took some time to be a real democracy country. Our country have become an absolute monarchy once. Needless to say, Tunisia is the same to Japan, now the people still feel unrelieved, so it needs more time to be a real one. To sum up, I think it is too early for Tunisia to get the Nobel prize, because the local situation of Tunisia is far from democracy and people feel unrelieved."
6960,"I almost agree with your opinion. But I do not think the result is all. I think the process which try to be world peace is also important. In terms of the point of the correct person who should be to receive the Novel Prize, I agree with you. I also think some current winners of the Novel Peace Prize are not suitable. Because they did not pursuit of world peace. In spite of not trying to be world peace, they received that Prize. As you said, many people hope the Novel Peace Prize bring us true peace as you."
6961,"I agree with your answer that the question doesn't have the answer. If we fall into that situation, we need to save people without adhering to the curious thought which we should parents firstly."
6963,"After reading this article, I feel that the humans breaks their own living place by themselves. I understand that the system of capitalism is necessary for our nowadays lives, but it is not good for the environment of our living places and the sources which are necessary for our loves. Nothing to say, the amount of oil is decreasing year by year. The oil is necessary for us, but it has the limit. In the future, the oil will be nothing by using by us. The present system of capitalism helps the reducing the natural sources which is important for our lives. The companies don't think they will use substantial sources instead of oil or any other natural sources. I understand what they do. In case, they try to develop their skills and to find new sources, it is hard for them. The research will cost the companies too much. Simply, selling higher and collecting reliable sources is good for nowadays capitalism. I think only big company which has the thinking about the sources can make progress our source and environment problem. I know that Bill Gates afford to pay much money , because he is one of the richest man in the world. I recommend that big companies receive the much money to make substantial sources by rich people and they try to do research. I think it is good way to get new sources which we need for our lives. However it is difficult because I think it is seldom rich people pay money to these production like Bill Gates. I hope that the present style of our living will not change and people will be able to live in comfort."
6964,"Your idea is understandable. As you said, in Japan the gap of rich people and poor people is getting expanding. I read one monograph. It is written in Japanese. Its title is 'the gap expanding in Japan and the USA society'. This paper shows that Japan is the second disparate country in the world. And the situation of the actual Japan and the USA's disparate society. The income between regular employees and part-timers is so different in Japan. The income of part-timers is too cheap to live by oneself. I wonder why the income is so different in Japan? Other countries do not have this kind of date like Japan. I understand the income of regular worker must be higher that part-timers, but the gap is too big. I think it is strange. I hope that the status of part-time worker gets higher and at least little a bit more income should pay to them in Japan."
6965,"I agree with you. All lives are equal. We can not say the answer. I think that this kind of question goes too far. I understand it is interesting because this question is too extreme too answer. I suppose that the answer to this question is not so important but imagining the situation and thinking what should we do is important. I think the answer is only date but the time we use for thinking what we should do is very meaningful for us. Actually, if we were in that kind of situation, I think we will make effort to help the both of them."
6966,"I agree with you. I think it is too early for Tunisia to get the Nobel Prize. As you said, the local situation of Tunisia is not good. There is the gap between the upper side of Tunisia and local people. I think they should receive the Nobel Prize after the gap is getting smaller."
6967,"I do not agree with you. I think it is not good if there are political reasons, rejecting one part of people is the same to racial discrimination. I don't support his speech if he has some prospects or not."
6970,"I was surprised at this news. I think that there are not any collect answers of the question which was taken up in this article. I think it is an impertinent question. We should treat every people's lives fairly. However, some people who set this question, think that mother's life is more important than girlfriend's life. It is terrible. I hope that they correct theirs mistakes."
6971,"I think so too. I think this question is impertinent because it doesn't treat two lives fairly. If I come upon such as scene, I will not be able to select one. If I save one person, another person die. Of course, if I can't decide, two lives are sacrificed. In the end, even if we do anything in this scene, nobody knows correct answer. Yesterday, I found a site on the Internet. It was known as 'can see only once in a lifetime'. The site asks you to choose your mother or a strange child. I think many people choose their mother. Then a strange child die. Even if you reload the site, the site display a message 'There won't be a second time'. So, you can't save a strange child's life. I think we should treat all lives fairly. However, there are the scene that we must choose one answer, even so there are not correct answer. It is the most important that you believe yourself."
6974,"Big factor that capitalism brought is mass consumption society. Instead of producing a large quantity of fortunes, the production method that spread out to extend profit called for mass consumption. In other words, it produced many goods using a large quantity of resources and It consumed a thing in large quantities and came to discard a thing in large quantities. Of course it is bad in environment because It exploit the earth in resources when someone produce things. Because people in capitalism use the electricity in large quantities, more CO2 is drained from the thermal power station. When they consume it in large quantities and take out garbage, it adversely affects environment in various form. A lot of chemical substances are included in most of the particularly recent garbage. Because a chemical substance is the thing which there was not on the earth formerly, it is not incorporated in a natural cycle. Therefore it leads to the ground, the sea, atmospheric pollution because it is not returned as energy naturally. It is to achieve an aim 'to minimize work force, and to produce the maximum' as for the thing which aimed of the socialism. Even if how is the means on achieving this aim, it is good. The environmental disruption does not matter. it needs a large quantity of electricity if it mechanizes all work. Then people in socialism operate a big thermal power station of the quantity of generation intensively most. On the socialism, this is not special. Thought to do anything for a purpose causes the environmental disruption. This is a point leading to the environmental disruption of the socialism. Thus, where cannot say unconditionally in a point of view called the environment because capitalism and neither of the socialism have nothing to do with the environmental disruption whether it is worse. I think that it is that an each person uses a thought about environment to be important."
6975,"I think this prize is not proper because indeed, there is a person damaged by war or weapon ,but it ignore his situation. So, there was no room for the question in Nobel Peace prize until now , but I don't think that I can easily understand this prize."
6976,"I think so,too. His policy has deflection too much and will win the antipathy of refugees, and I think that it bring about a new menace. So, I think that he should change it to a little milder policy."
6977,"Terrorism by ISIL and immigration problems are the world must solve earliest now. Although Trump Mr. trying to exclude all the Muslims from the United States, I don't oppose the policy completely. Of course, The reason isn't Muslim is bad and it is we hardly take measures to terrorism by ISIL. They are different from the criminal group just like doing things you want to do. Their hideout exist around the world and it is also possible to hide while they aren't noticed. In addition, they are good at information warfare and part of the world of human who watched such as their videos may even become the companions of ISIL. I have felt more threat than any terrorist organization that existed until now. So I can't oppose to the radical policies of Mr.Trump. However, there is also a point which doesn't make sense. They have taken action while often shouting 'Allah Akbar'. Allah is the only God in Islam. However, we mustn't equate them with Muslims, because their behavior is far from the teachings of Islam. In Japan, the media has reported that ISIL called Islamic countries . However, it had given rise to misunderstanding that ISIL = Muslim. I think it isn't the case in the United States. Of course, I think Trump don't believe seriously prejudice that such ISIL = Muslim, but he would have raised the current policy in the near attitude at least. By saying of Mr. Trump's this statement, public opinion began to be bisected large. To be bisected means that the supporters exist. Moreover, the number was beyond my imagination. Than-expected number of people was in favor of Mr. Trump. President Obama was once stopped in an attempt to give the resident rights to illegal immigrants. American measures has been changing for the immigrants."
6979,"I was impressed with your opinion. Anything can not be resolved unless to try to know. Because ISIL is called Islamic countries, there are people think they are trying to eliminate the Muslims. However, it is a mistake. And it is speculation of ISIL to deepen the groove of the Muslims and the general public. The most effective measures for ISIL is to eliminate the ISIL. We have to oppose against to take action from here. To that end, at first, we must be interested in this issue."
6980,"I couldn't understand this news when I read this so I researched other articles about this news. I was very surprised that Chewbacca was arrested, but was surprised that dozen Vader went for the mayoral election more. Ukraine is a country full of the humor. Having been arrested this time Chewbacca (the man who played the part) of the political party member called Internet Party of Ukraine. On Sunday of the end of last week, an election for mayor is held in the town of Odessa, and it is about the polling place that a thing happened. When Chewbacca comes to the spot by car with storm true par, and a paper is found by a police officer; is a problem occurrence by having been license non-possession. I was arrested saying that I performed a vicious act to refuse a result, the legal question of the police officer and was assigned to fine approximately 900 yen equivalency."
6981,"I understand your opinion and I agree. I didn't know that Chewbacca is a character of STAR WARS as you didn't know. If this happen in Japan, Japanese people would think him strange. As you say, disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. People should think the meaning of vote for election and consider each candidates deeply before the election. Their manifesto and thinking or behavior will effect the election."
6982,"I agree with your opinion. Japan will focus on education in job hunting, but this criterion has been delayed in the world. Men of ability is get a good job. It must be the case. Therefore you need assistance to families are facing poverty problems. But now the Japanese government is facing a variety of problems. Of course this problem also important, but it must be run to decide the budget in conjunction with other problems. Therefore, it is the status that can not be resolved immediately."
6983,"I agree with your opinion. Now, Ukraine is very politically unstable situation. Ukrainians are working seriously to politics. And to be disturb is very unpleasant for them. If you see such a person in Japan's election, ordinary human will get angry. Of course cosplay is not entirely bad. I think that it wants followed in the future as one of entertainment. However, I want them to observe the TPO. Have you ever seen people singing a song and dancing a dance in the polling stations of Japan? Such a person doesn't exist."
6984,"His policy was too iron-handed, and I thought that this policy caused a misfortune for the United States.I think that he should learn that he stands in the situation of the other people and thinks about a thing."
6985,I agree with you . The developed country should reconsider an environmental problem.
6986,"I was surprised at time when I read this article. This is because it is difficult whether I help a parent when oneself faced a crisis, or you help a lover. I really think that I cannot start answering that I do not face a crisis. This agenda was very difficult, and I thought that the conclusion was not given."
6987,"I don't agree with your opinion. I am also opposed to the Nobel Peace Prize. However, the reason isn't the winner is disturb the peace. Definition of peace is so ambiguous. There are situations when some people see the world is peaceful, other people see the world isn't peaceful in the world. For example, two organizations that conflict with war and civil war. I won't tolerate the presence of ISIL. However, ISIL think the world that they aim is peaceful. It is not a mistake of the people. Nobel Peace Prize is a presence that could destroy the values of such people. We should eliminate it right now."
6988,"I disagree with you. It is true that the recent prize winner may be surely a person disturbing peace as you say . However, successive many prize winners are people who really made an effort for peace, and I think that they was appropriate people for Nobel Peace prize. In addition, it is to be incorrigible in anything that a personal opinion becomes available and is synonymous with it criticizing decision by majority to criticize it, and I think that they may decide nothing without individual thought."
6989,"I agree with your opinion. The law's purpose is to judge the people but it doesn't force the action to the people. My mother and girlfriend are important for me and humans. I think the situation I can help only one person is the unusual one. If I can help two people, I will help the absolute two people. The problem I think this question isn't suitable as a question of judicial examination."
6990,"I often see a sentence 'the Arabian spring success' when I check this news, may it be said that I really succeeded? I hear the dark news concerning Tunisia including the hotel surprise attack that happened in Bardot Museum surprise attack a half year ago, June consistently. A suicide bombing happens in Turkey of the east, and pains and the uneasiness of the civic life seem to be conveyed in Tunisia which should be excited by winning Nobel Prize. The distance to peace might go far more and more but I understood that circumstances of Tunisia were not so simple when I read articles well. I am common to the circumstances of the two countries at the point where the existence of the radicals tissue 'Islamic nation' casts a gloomy shadow over. The unemployment rate of the youth is more than 40% in Tunisia. The Islamic nation combatant from Tunisia is that there is the most it probably because I am related to it if I watch it by approximately 3,000 and country distinction. The youth who does not feel charm in accomplished democratization but it with much effort in Arabic spring flows out in the Islamic nation. It is a serious problem. It shows the sides different again of Nobel Peace prize when I think so. As few President Obama won the assumption of office room once, Nobel Peace prize seems to have possibilities to be sometimes given with expectation to future peace. Uneasiness is left in Tunisia, but surely still in comparison with Libya and Egypt makes the body of the democratic nation. I think that it is this Nobel Peace prize to expect authority pickles to be opposed to the Islamic nation at the same time to have evaluated it as a success example. The Tunisian government will be to have felt big pressure. I want not only to raise an idea, but also to show that the politics is possible."
6991,"I cannot agree Novel Peace Prize. Terrorism occur one after another, and unemployment rate is high. In other words, reality is far from democracy's success. think it is great that there is a wide gap between Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet and citizens, so I agree this Nobel Peace Prize."
6992,"I understand your idea. I think it's good idea too. The value of the Nobel Prize will fall steadily if a person and the group which are not good for this prize win it. Also, the groups can move boldly and their ideas are in danger of being treated as pacifism by using the tittle of Nobel Peace Prize as you say. Nobel Peace Prize Committee should think the value of this Prize deeply and give to the most good person who fight to keep a peace. However, a lot of serious problems happen all over the world now including the problem of Islamic State and terrorism. I think that word in itself peace is in condition not to be able to easily give off it, and the weight of this prize will become bigger and bigger from now on. I will check the movement for a peace over the world. Many Japanese people don't think about a peace deeply."
6993,"Your opinion is so great. I think so,too.I think we should the define of the all people's safety or happiness."
6994,"I agree with your opinion. i think Nobel Peace Prize is only for the name,now.Not the important thing receiving this prize,I think it that there is it whether they left achievement with this prize in the world."
6995,"I agree with you.Your investment is so good. I think that Novel peace prize has a little worth, so the prize is re consider many times."
6996,I can't agree the prize.Other Novel prize are clear why choose the person but peace prize is not. The news is clear case.I think the prize should be given a person that all people can agree.
6998,"In this article, Donald J. Trump said we should block all Muslims enter the United States. I can understand his words and thinking, but I cannot agree with him. This is because he did not think all people's safety. In other word, he worried Americans' lives. Of course, it is right for him to be concerned people in U.S. However, today terrorism and IS are international problems. He and we, Japanese should think this problem deeply."
6999,"I disagree with you. I think his speech is thoughtless. He delivered speech offensively, because of his anger toward terrorism."
7000,"I agree with you. As you said, all countries should share information about pollution. In addition, I also think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, as Bill Gates thought. I hope this problem is solved early."
7001,"I was surprised at this article, too. I also think Chewbacca gathered attention, and people all over the world turned their eyes to Ukraine. Next time, I hope Chewbacca will attract people for good behavior."
7002,"I agree with your opinion. In Japan, the poor gets poorer.The government should save these people."
7005,"I agree with your opinion on point that Donald Trump's plan is not the solution for terrorism of Islamic estates. To be frank, I caught various threats of the Islamic nation as other people's affairs without a tragedy of recent Paris. May be, there were a lot of the Paris citizens who were a way of thinking like me a little ago. However, I came to think about an Islamic nation more seriously after a sudden tragedy happened in big city Paris and came to feel what's called terrorism closer. I am a sense of fear not to know what happens when and where. There will be many people who do not want to accept an immigrant to save own country like his policy in such a fear. Even if some people believing in Islam do a slaughter act and war, removing the other people of Islam who are not responsible is not good. In addition, not only it fan an extreme Islamic nation, but also will inspire people's fear even more, and it may delay a solution to the problem that the politician of a big large country of the influence suggests such a policy. If not only Donald Trump, but also many people can have courage to cut off a grudge and hatred, it may contribute to solving the problem earlier."
7006,"I agree with your opinion. His offensive idea is very dengerous.His idea based on racism so. it will have bad effect for all over the world.Mireinarisawa say 'If his plan comes true, another tragedy would happen again like it occurred in Germany during WW2'. I think so too,Mr trump's idea is very dengerous.These reasons for Americans should think again their candidate"
7007,"I agree with your opinion. Mr trump's idea is not solution for terrorism.His speech is very offensive but his plans are not realistic. If his plan realize,USA will be a exclusive country.We should research him and learn a lot of things for many countries. The knowledge will help us to think for other countries."
7008,"I agree with your opinion. I am surprised too when I watch TV news about him.Terroism is so afraid but Mr trump's idea also afraid for me.I think that his idea will be expand and a lot of people discriminate for him. Now he discriminate Muslim but he will attack other religion,races and countries. So,his idea is very dangerous"
7009,"I feel so too.When I read the article for the first time, I think that it is a nice joke and it is funny.However, It is TRUE and happen in USA.I think the joke candidates cannot work for USA because they could not win the election themselves and they do these behave like a joke. That tell us the candidate does not have ability for work. I think we should learn a lot of things because we should vote collect candidate not like a joke candidate."
7010,"I disagree with your opinion, I do not think that the Prime Minister Abe thinks only Americans feel or demand. I think that he makes the best decision in consideration of the situation and future in Japan. Therefore, he should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa and I want him to reconcile with a citizen of Okinawa."
7011,"I think that Trump should take back his words, because it may lead to misunderstanding. I think that Muslims felt themselves discriminated by Trump. However his remark doesn't mean to discriminate against Muslims. It means to prevent the terrorists from entering the U.S. They may hide behind immigrants. IS is the most fearful group of terrorists in the world. IS is a group of red Muslims. So Trump want to ban Muslim immigration. However I think that it is the best way for solving this issue, to stop accepting all immigrants."
7012,"I think that the election is very important and holy event for the nation. When I was read this article, I felt uncomfortable. I think that the election should guarantee freedom. But a man who dressed as Chewbacca perverted the meaning of freedom. It was a natural consequence that he was arrested."
7013,"When l read this article, I was surprised that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels in recent years. Until now, I had an impression that China does not think about the green energy, because they discharge a large amount of CO2. I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. This issue can't be solved, if all the country don't join forces with each other."
7014,"I think that it is a good thing for the citizens of Tunisia , a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia were awarded the 96th Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in moving the North African country towards democracy. Tunisia has a serious problem of terrorism. I hope that this news become a chance, to solve the problem."
7067,"Because I have no experience of living in foreign countries, it is so difficult for me to understand a religious value of foreign people. But this arrest is too extreme to understand even if they make much of religions.I think they can express their thought and feeling freely as long as they don't do harm with other people. There are so many people who have various thoughts all over the world that it is important to respect and accept each other."
7068,"I was surprised at this topic.Japan basically doesn't have such a taboo and I don't practice any religions, so I felt this problem was strange.In addition, I consider this punishment was too strict.Freedom of religion for people should be accepted all over the world.But this notion is actually too difficult to realize.Now we can should do is to understand and accept various cultures of foreign country.We should not oppress other cultures."
7069,"I'm surprised at this issue. Most of Japanese don't care about own religion. So I had never thought about that issue. First I read this blog I think Sri Lanka officer is too serious to the woman who has Buddha tattoo on her right arm. She has the freedom to do it. Also we could say she's tattoo is art. But to think it carefully, I realized we need to understand foreign countries cultures and acknowledge each other's differences. We should not make a decision based on only one side. For Sri Lanka people, they feel that woman insults Buddha. Through this class I learn about those things."
7072,"I was surprised to know that Naomi Coleman had been arrested for her Buddhism tattoo. I think we should research for the particular rules that is different from our own country. And,also l think the country that has the particular rules should announce to the tourists ."
7073,"It is important to accept other senses of value.People in Sri Lanka should accept that people living in other country have various senses of value.Travelers need to accept senses of value which people in Sri Lanka have and adapt it,as saying goes ''When in Rome,do as Romans do.'"
7074,"There are so many religions and beliefs in the world and therefore so many taboos exist in many countries. In Japan, many people don't believe in particular religion, so we have few times to think about taboos. However, in many other countries, people have many taboos about food, gesture, clothing, and so on. We should learn about these taboos and be careful not to hurt others' religious feelings."
7075,"I was surprised when I read this article . In many cases , social customs and religions vary from country to country. Unfortunately , this contrariety in a way of thinking or opinions can cause various problems. So We should try to solve these problems , but it is difficult to solve them completely . Then , what should we do to solve them ? In my opinion , we need to know the difference in a way of thinking or opinions more deeply and respect other cultures."
7076,"I think people who have radical thoughts may be dangerous. I can understand people deport them because of radical thoughts. They might take radical actions and hurt others.However, I don't know whether minorities tend to have radical thoughts and I think it is very difficult to judge by arm's tattoos whether we should deport them. It is not surprising that there are different cultures all over the world. We should understand other cultures and respect for them."
7078,"I was surprised to know hurting others' feelings is illegal in Sri Lanka.It is regrettable that Naomi was arrested even though she tattooed her arm because of her religious belief. Ignorance about other culture often causes problems when going abroad, so we should be interested in and accept other cultures."
7079,"I think people in Sri Lanka should accept visitors' action more tolerantly.Sri Lankan think getting a Buddha tattoo is the action that desecrate Buddha, but I think visitors do not know such habitat and they do not do that intentionally. I think Sri Lankan should not force visitors to follow their belief and habitat because Sri Lankan belief and habitat do not always apply to other countries. By the way, I also think that visitors should research the country they are going to go to in advance. When people stay in abroad, the majority is native people and visitors are minority, so I think visitors should adapt themselves to native people's lifestyle. Thus, I think people should accept others' culture and live together while respecting each other's belief and habitat."
7080,"When I read this article , I was very surprised that a British tourist was arrested for a Buddha tattoo on her arm in Sri Lanka. It seemed that she did not know getting a Buddha tattoo was a big problem in Sri Lanka. I think it was a pity that she was deported. In my opinion, people who are going to go to a country should know about religions there in advance. Meanwhile, people should be more tolerant of tourist's behavior, even if it is religious one."
7081,"This issue made me surprised.Almost Japanese don't care about their religion,and religion have no influence on our lives.But in other countries,religion occupies a large part of lives and it also can be a purpose of their lives.When we visit another country,we have to try to recognize the culture in advance and must not bring our senses of values."
7082,"I was surprised to see this article, because it is said that Japanese have a little interest in religions and I also haven't thought very deeply about our religions. So, I recognized the importance of respect for various religions if they aren't major through this article. Then if the two taxi drivers and police officer had noticed that she was a tourist who didn't know taboo in Sri Lanka, they should have warned her to wear a long-sleeved top before she was arrested. And then, she didn't hurt others."
7084,"I was surprised at this news. I have been to foreign countries. but I have never felt the difference of culture. Each country has its own cultures. If I will go to other countries, I have to research difference of culture.'when in Rome do as the Romans do.' This proverb is a perfect for this story."
7085,"I was surprised to know that Naomi Coleman was arrested for 'hurting others' religious feelings'.I think that we should receive many culture and religious, and become tolerant more .But it is difficult .Because they has a more religious aspect.So, I think that we should get education of other religious to try to understand other culture first."
7086,"This made me shocked. As I touched the thing called religion in which I've never been interested for the first time. Of course I knew generally the Japanese are not interested in religion. In this case, I realized I am the one of that. Because when I saw this news first time, I felt this was like a fiction. In other words,I did not feel the reality in religious consciousness. I think I should know more about any religions through this news. This will help me understanding any other news such as ISIS."
7087,"I think this arrest was too extreme. To be sure, Sri Lankan have firm beliefs for Buddha and so might have been hurt by her tattoo. But many people around the world will seek the freedom of their own thoughts. Nowadays, the world have been getting global rapidly, so Sri Lankan should accept the thoughts of foreigners. However, of course, we mustn't forget to respect such as the religious feelings of minority. It is important for people to understand different values and cultures in the world."
7088,"I was surprised to read this topic. If I were the woman who was arrested, I was very regret to put a tattoo. In addition It is difficult for me to think this issue because I don't have religious mind. But I thought religious mind is very strong for people who believe their religion. So If I travel abroad, I research about the country in advance."
7089,"I think this story shows the difficult problem to solve. The problem is that whether the religious policy in Sri Lanka should be complied or the freedom of individual will should be respected. Of course,freedom is important. But if it goes too far, people will conflict with each other. Each country has each different religious policy. So I think tourists need to understand its difference and respect it."
7090,I think that it is strange that she deport. Because it is no problem if the Muslim wear a burqa in UK. I think that all county including Sri Lanka should accept the freedom of religion. The police should not deports her because she did nothing.
7091,"When I read this article, I remembered Japanese way of thinking about tattoo. In Japan, tattoo is unapproachable by reason of connection with Japanese gang. Most onsen and public bath don't allow tattooed people to take a bath because they corrupt public morals. This example is similar to article, since onsen attracts a great number of tourists. It indicates the subject is also in Japan.I think good that each country have culture. We should respect and understand each other's cultures for comfortable travel."
7092,I knew there were many religious and rules all over the world. But I was very surprised to know Naomi Coleman was arrested because of her tattoos. I don't know it is right or not that she was arrested. So I found it was important to think the religious or rules in each country. I'll be careful to go to foreign countries which has strange rules.
7093,"I was very surprised at this news because Japanese does not believe in specific religion. So I felt that this news is strange But I think that Naomi should have acted more carefully. She should have been able to image that the country which believed in Buddhism did some reaction for tattoo of Buddha . When we go to the other countries for a trip , we should be careful about the religion of the country."
7094,"I didn't know that there were some religion problem occurred in other countries. In Japan, there is a rule that people who has tattoo can't enter to a pool, hot spring, and so on. However, if the tattoo is covered with something, usually everyone can go to pool. I knew this rule in japan so I thought the incident in Sri Lanka was too strict. Maybe she could where a jacket to hide her tattoo and this could be a one of solution. Also I think every country should make rule clear that visitor can be careful about some taboos. If they knew nothing, they can do nothing. I wish everyone in this world can visit many places without trouble about taboos."
7095,"I was surprised to know this news because I was not familiar with such a religious problem. Admittedly, it was a insult for some people to use a Buddha tattoo, but arresting her was too strict a punishment. Everyone should be free to decide what religion they believe in and the way to practise their religion. According to the news, hardline Buddhist groups have caused violent attacks against Muslims and Christians. These troubles will increase in today's globalised society. In order to solve them and get along with others, we should take steps. For example, we have to try to understand religion and behave carefully where there are strict rules of religion. For instance, we should not take photos in front of statues of Buddha. Moreover, in the area of Muslim, women should not expose their skins in public."
7096,"When we talk with foreign people and visit foreign countries, it is important to understand the culture. And, we need to adjust ourself to the culture there. However, the thing about religion is very sensitive. There is a thought which we can't understand. But unless someone hurt others, their thought and their belief are free. So, the woman's arrest was undeserved."
7097,I thought it is difficult to understand differences of cultures when I read this news.I'm afraid of breaking a taboo without knowing it.I would like to study and take care of various cultures or religions when I will go to foreign country or I will meet foreigners.
7098,"At first I have made fun among my friends,because my face resembles foreigner!So I am interested in foreign culture originally. I was surprised at prejudice for the religion.In Japan, feelings for the religion isn't so strong that we don't mind believer of other religion.But other countries have some inherent religions, that is why small and large fights commonly caused by religious opposition."
7099,"I was surprised at this incident. We usually don't think seriously about this kind of issues because Japan and Japanese people are so tolerate of religions. We, however, will have to consider these issues because Japan is going to be more global society. We should discuss how much cultural differences Japanese society should allow."
7100,"This news made me shocked. This is because there aren't so many religious problems in Japan, and l don't know the fact that people are deported even easily like this. In my opinion, we should allow various ways of belief except ways with hurting others. Though I can recognize the feelings of Sri Lanka's people, this is going too far. We need tolerance towards religious each other."
7101,"It is obvious that when you are in one country, you should follow the country's law and at the same time you should respect the country's culture and religion. Therefore I think this woman was very careless. She should have learnt more about the country before she visited there. Similar problems happen in Europe. For example, Muslim tried to build a mosque right next to Cologne Cathedral and German opposed the plan. Finally the mosque was not built there. These problems are solved easily by the old proverb 'When you are at Rome do as the Romans do.'"
7102,"I was surprised to read this article. I didn't know that Sri Lanka is particularly sensitive about images of the Buddha this much. I thought it is important to know the manners and customs of other countries well. When we go to the other countries, I understood that we should go after knowing the country ."
7103,"I consider the topic of this article is difference of values between nations. The peculiar cultures of nations or countries must be respected. In the foreign country,we are just tourists. However people in the country spend their dairy lives. Stranger should not change rules of regions into their way. Of course,we have to respect our own culture in oversea countries, so we can enjoy our travels not to offend their cultures. The saying,When in Rome, do as the Romans do, is true."
7104,"I think this is a difficult question. First, we should understand other's thinking because everyone has ones own thought. But, it is also important to respect the value of particular people. So I think we should discuss this matter more than now."
7105,"After I read this article, I think people have to acknowledge their different sense of values. Each countries recognize their national religions and have traditional rules. When people visit another country , they need to obey the local rules. Moreover, it is difficult for Japanese people to understand this kind of religious problem between countries, because most Japanese do not practise ''one '' religion.It means the people do not care about that. They celebrate not only Christmas but also New Years Day and go to shrines to pray in the morning. Japan is a very strange country which has mixed religious culture,but i think it is not so bad because it does not cause difficult religious problems like Sri Lanka and Britain."
7106,"After I read through this article, I felt it is very difficult to understand the culture in other countries. For Japanese, the image of tattoo is related to Yakuza, however it is popular in most of the European countries. There are hundreds of these examples. People mostly do not care about other communities culture, and sometimes we unconsciously harm others feelings. Especially with religious things this may happen, but we should try to understand their ways. It is impossible to be like them but let's have a thoughtful mind to accept them. Solving religious problems is not so easy, but I think the day will come if we do not give up our effort to appreciate and understand."
7107,"'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.' as the proverb says. Actually all people should respect not only laws but also regional customs. However, if the authority want to arrest people who break these rules, arrests must be carried out by law, not only by customs and practices. So if Sri Lanka carried out those arrests or deportations, I understand their decisions."
7108,"Most Japanese don't think deeply about our own religion,and so do l .Actually I don't know my religious affiliation. Therefore, this topic seemed to be too overdoing at first. But, thinking deeply about this issue, I found l saw this topic only by my religious perspective . This problem also might be caused by such difference of religious perspective too."
7109,"It is too difficult to solve the problem. British woman had got a Buddha tattoo surely, but the act was only to indicate the religion belief. However, Sri Lanka's low and the local people is very strict to insult religion, so her act had the potential to be punished by the low. I think it is important to faith the religion, nevertheless we should use our head how we indicate the belief."
7110,"I studied the world history when I was a high school student. So I know the majority in Sri Lanka are Buddhists. But, until I read this article, I didn't know the rule of Buddhism in Sri Lanka was so strict. I was very surprised! In Japan, there are not many people who believe in particular religion. Thus I think that it is difficult for Japanese people, including me, to understand this kind of religious rule.But, we should try to understand in order to communicate with local people."
7111,"Religion is one of the most difficult problem in the world. I think the fault of Ms.Coleman had taken herself for she understood Buddhism and she didn't really know that doctrines and customs are different by some areas where are same religion. It is said that When in Rome do as the Romans do, Tourists have to learn taboo where they want to go, it is good idea to decrease such problems I think. To learn other custom can be apply to world peace aspect of religion in that understanding. Islam are seemed to be frightening people by Japanese, because Japanese heard some news:9.11 or Al-Qaeda or ISIS ,But, in fact, most Muslims are mild. This is a typical misunderstanding example. The more Japanese learn Islam history, culture and custom, the more right knowledge of Islam spread to Japan, and it will good affect each interaction. Globalization is not all good, it makes new conflict between some ethnic groups. So we should understand some custom each other. Ms.Coleman's tattoo hurt Sri Lankan religion at least. If she had more considered, the taxi man would have not done such behave."
7112,"I think it is really important to know the culture and rules before we travel to the area. It is a kind of respect to the people there. If u break the rules, it may make they unhappy. In addition, in my opinion, it can help us feel the lifestyle in that area. It can let us realize the culture there better and be sure to have a wonderful time. There are various people in the world. Everyone has different sense of worth values. We should try to accept those so that our world will be wider,I suppose."
7113,"I am surprised that Naomi Coleman was arrested for a Buddha tattoo in Sri Lanka, because the tattoo is no problem in the county. Nevertheless, people in Sri Lanka think of her as guilty. So I think it is important to understand not only laws but also cultures when we communicate with people in other countries."
7114,"I think that Ms Coleman cannot escape blame for this issue.It is true Sri Lankan authorities took an extremely strong measure,but it is also true there is a possibility that she would hurt local people extremely with her insensitive Buddha tattoo. she should examine customs in Sri Lanka on the Internet before traveling there and wear long-sleeved clothes. These days more and more people are traveling abroad.At the same time the importance of cross-cultural understanding is growing.In our world,fortunately,you can readily gather information about foreign countries by surfing the Net.Therefore,you should in mind beforehand that cultures in foreign countries where you plan to go by doing that.It helps not only your trip more smoothly.It also helps local people welcome you and you more happy."
7115,"I was surprised when I read this article because Sri Lankan stick too precisely to Buddhism. Japanese people believe various religions such as Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism. Therefore, we do not usually think about religions deeply and hardly think about many taboos. However, the problem continues happening if we do not understand their rule. Thus I think that I have to check foreign intelligence when I go abroad and have to understand their religions and thoughts."
7116,"From my point of view, as a foreign student in Japan, I really mistook innumerably in many respects at first. But I always try to behave carefully and ask for other people whether my behavior would be unfavorable to them. Because I think the cultural difference could not be changed, but we are able to attempt to accept the difference and then understand the thought of each other. It is manner to know the country's culture and convention where you will visit beforehand. Especially in the religious aspect, or we will face to the same situation that the woman experienced in the material, though it was a pitiful story."
7117,"When I read this news,I was surprised that a British women was arrested for a Buddha tattoo on her arm in Sri Lanka . I think a British women don't know that Sri Lanka is particularly sensitive about images of the Buddha . In my opinion ,we should know about religions when we go on a trip. Meanwhile, it is important to accept sense of visitor."
7118,"I thought there was nothing surprising about this article because it's quite natural that each country has each attitude toward various religions. When I was lived in the United States, there were so many strict Christians and I thought I had to respect their religious beliefs. I mean she had to know how people relate to Buddhism in Sri Lanka and respect their attitudes."
7119,"I was very surprised at this article.I think it is too hard to understand this arrest.Certainly, I don't have knowledge about religion. But, this arrest is hard to understand, even if I have a lot of knowledge about religion.To prevent accidents like this, countries which have the rules different from other countries' shouldn't apply the rules to tourists."
7120,"I am surprised to hear this news. In Japan,we are almost unfamiliar to religion,so I cannot understand why the people was arrested there. Knowing this news,I think I should come to know more about religion to understand what is going on all over the world in a true meaning."
7121,"In my opinion, this measure against her is fair. Some people in Japan may argue that this is too strict. We should recognize ,however, this as follows: each country has a different religious rule. As a rule, Japanese people are indifferent to religion, and we should not think about this problem with our standard. I think that her attitude was really careless and she had to grasp attitudes toward Buddhism in Sri Lanka."
7122,"I was so surprised when I read this article. Because I think it's hers own freedom right to put a tattoo in, and the contents won't be the reason that every kind of she is arrested. So I think Sri Lanka should expand freedom rights."
7123,"I was interested in new traffic lights. I think it is the sign that shows what gender identity disorder is accepted in Australia. I think it very important to respect gender identity disorder as their identity.because the right that all men live a free life as the human rights.So,we mustn't laugh at this action but respect."
7124,"The idea of expressing a normality of same-sex couples through lights is very creative. Lights are seen in everyday life by all people, so the idea is very effective. Certainly cost for this project is so expensive that it seems to be a waste of taxes, but I think it is worth pouring a lot of money."
7125,I thought new traffic lights is very good . Because I thought that prejudice against same-sex couples is eliminated. Because in Japan have not yet accepted the marriage of same-sex couples I think that may be adopt in Japan.
7126,"This idea was quite surprised me actually. In Japan and the most of the Asian country, the same-sex couples are still not accepted by laws and people. In my point of view, Asia needs some extraordinary change in this respect. To achieve this goal, the idea likes the new traffic light from Austria will gradually change the people's thought and awareness. I hope the equal right to pursuit happiness of same-sex-couple will soon come true in Asia."
7127,"I thought that Japan has two sides of look again.one side that is brilliant is one of the most richest countries among the world.The another side that is shadow is the world's highest suicide rate.In addition to,in these days,the development of Japan starts to stop developing like before.And I think that the massacres like news have increased.So,I think Japanese government shouldn't change the constitution but solve these problems."
7128,"When I read this article, I thought new traffic lights in Vienna were very good. In japan, more and more people are paying attention to people who are gay or lesbian , and more and more cities are admitting same-sex marriages. Therefore, in my opinion , people who are gay or lesbian are not unusual any way , and as is said in this article , we should promote the idea that same-sex couples are a normal, everyday reality."
7129,"This article made me surprised. In some countries,the prejudice against gay-couple has not perished yet.And it is same in Japan. So,I think this attempt for gay-couple in Australia is really meaningful.And it can be a good stimulate to other countries to remove prejudices from all over the world."
7130,"It is great to set the new design signals and it is also wonderful that many people are positive when asked whether they liked the concept.According to the news,some people regard the plan as a waste of taxes.However,I don't think so,because it is important to promote the idea that the same-sex couples are normal and the use of money is sometimes needed to promote that.I hope that the trend spread to Japan."
7131,"Thing needed to be a lawyer or a judge are not to treat people unequally but to treat people equally.Therefore I think that the exam which made them compare the value of lives was inappropriate to test law,theory,legal practice and ethics."
7132,"I took it for granted that depict are a man and a woman. So I was impressed by Austria traffic lights. They have a rich imagination. I agree with it. I don't think the lights contravene traffic regulations and are a waste of taxpayers' money at a cost of $70,000. It can make people to understand about the same-sex couples. Especially in Japan, the marriage of same-sex couples have not yet accepted. It means transgender person should be understood more."
7133,I like this idea. Everyone should have rights to marry anyone whom they love. Gays should be accepted because diversity is one of the most important elements of modern society. Austria's traffic lights may help us accept same-sex couples.
7135,"I think this campaign is a good idea. Traffic lights are part of everyday life,so this campaign is an effective way to make people accept that gays and lesbians are normal. In modern life, values vary from person to person.Gays and lesbians should not be discriminated. Recently, Ireland accepted the same sex marriage in spite of a Catholic country. I hope that all the country say 'Yes!' about the same sex marriage."
7136,"Once people believed as time goes by, the problem of the seriously high older people's proportion in Japan will take a turn for the better. However, still today, this big problem has no clue. Japan's highest public debt in the world shows the pressure of the financial budget for renter in Japan. In Japan's modern society, the trend to retire people by 65 years old seems inevitably. So the hard-line policy by government is needed to promote prolong the retirement, which might be the only way to solve this problem."
7137,"Religious problems are happening all over the world because each religious organization has its own belief and they hate being destroyed. We must try to solve the problems , but some people have wrong ideas. For example, Donald Trump continues to make discriminatory comments about minorities. We must display tolerance and accept their differences."
7139,"I think this traffic lights system is great. Though some people are objecting, it is good for gender minorities being noticed by many people. But too much consideration for them is bad , because we can often damaging to them without noticing it. We must try to solve this problem."
7140,"To tell the truth, I do not like North Korea because this country is always annoying other countries , especially Japan and South Korea. Japan has the issue of abducted Japanese taken to North Korea. We must solve this problem. North Korea has launched rockets despite condemnation of countries all over the world. I cannot understand why. I hope this country will stop launching rockets immediately."
7141,"I felt that Japan has no ability to take action when I read this news first time. Elimination of discrimination must be a global purpose, off course in Japan, this is so. Luckily there is not so much 'racial discrimination' in Japan because Japan is an ethnically homogeneous nation but how's about Discrimination against homosexuals? I think for Japanese people this is the most familiar discrimination. However Japanese government hasn't taken action yet, at least I think so. As a result, Japanese people can't understand it at all. I think Japanese government should approach the problem of discrimination, especially about homosexuals, referring to this Vienna's project."
7142,"I'm very surprised at the idea that show equality for the sex minority. Because of the traffic lights, people might gradually accept and respect them. Nowadays, equality is one of the most important things. I think it is novel and effective to show equality by the things which a lot of people see every day such as traffic lights. Japanese government should follow European countries and encourage citizens to stop discriminating minority."
7143,I agree to the same-sex marriage. Because I think that same-sex marriage is individual free. A person with an agreeable thought increases to same-sex marriage and thinks that it is good. I think that same-sex marriage should be accepted all over the world.
7144,I think this idea is very nice. The people who is called 'ONEE' has been seen on TV recently in Japan. Many citizens recognize there are people who are suffering with a gender identity disorder. But such people haven't been accepted in our society. It is fact that there were some cases that the workers were demoted after they announced their thinking of gender themselves. I hope all people could live their lives in their way with a responsibility.
7145,"I think that new traffic lights system is good, but that we should consider which country introduce that system. In countries whose people hasn't prejudice against sexual minorities such as European countries, that system play a important role of equal treatment for them. But in countries whose people are nervous of sexual issues such as Japan, that system will come to discriminate, not classify. Actually, we Japanese people regard sexual minorities as special and unique existence, for example we call them 'ONEE.' So, we should introduce that system after people deepen understanding of sexual minorities."
7146,"I think that it is a quite good attempt to promote the idea that same-sex couples are a normal reality by using pedestrian traffic lights. Since many people use pedestrian traffic lights almost every day, it is quite effective way to insists something by that. I think that every people have their own concept about their love and it is quite natural that there are some people who love same-sex people. Moreover, same-sex couples don't have bad influence to us at all. I think that we don't have any right to deny their love. I wish that some attempts like this will be adopted in Japan someday."
7147,"I have doubted of Japanese death penalty system since I read the novel 'Jusankaidan' in my high school days. It is said that death penalty is a retributive punishment. It would not be retribution even if carrying it out to a person expecting the death penalty. We should keep such people alive. I think what we need is thinking about our social system, the background of the crime."
7148,"I think new traffic lights have both disadvantages except this article. A good point, people can see traffic lights unconsciously, then they may become not to have a sense of incongruity to gay person. A weak point, these campaigns may be the occasion for a prejudice against gay person. I can't make a judgement about whether new traffic lights are good or bad. For this reason, this problem is interesting for me."
7149,"When I read this article, I had a sense of incongruity. It will be natural that the suspect who did a non-humanitarian act 'to kill people' is given the penalty. However, I think it is hard to say that it is connected directly with the conclusion 'he should have committed suicide'. And one more thing, people in Japan are demanded a result in society. I think it may be the cause for much suicide in Japan. Since murder happened, I can't say the carefree thing. However, I think it is necessary to think about not only the result but also the process."
7150,"Through this news I didn't feel surprised at all. I feel sense of crisis about that. The reason of my feeling is clarity, North Korea has done like this too much. In other words, I've gotten used to these news. Also North Korea did missile weapons experiment without hiding these days. Fortunately,these missiles didn't fired to aimed at the any country as the enemy clearly. However annually the risk of a catastrophe must be increased. I will continue checking the news about North Korea."
7151,"I think this is interesting, but has a disadvantage. Traffic lights are placed to improve our safety. If they has changed somehow, we would be confused and in the worst case, there could be some accidents."
7152,I think it is good plan to promote tolerance and the idea that same-sex couples are normal. But it is unnatural that pedestrian traffic lights change from a stick man to two men or two women. It seems to emphasize that same-sex couples are abnormal.
7153,"I think it is good idea that same-sex couples are normal not unusual. There is a people who is prejudiced against same-sex couples. I think that this trial that is going to reduce the prejudice to a same-sex is good. We must perform such an action positively,because all the people are equal, and the way of thinking that same-sex couples are abnormal is not equal. I wish that all people accept same-sex couples and they consider same-sex couples to normal."
7154,"When I read this article, I was not surprised very much. North Korea has done a test-firing of a missile, so I have been used to such a thing. North Korea is the country which is not predictable and North Korea may become the country which is dangerous to the whole world in the future. I think that it is not good that the policy of the country is decided by one person and it is obvious that it is related to a missile test. I hope that North Korea becomes the democratic nation."
7155,"I was surprised at this traffic lights. In Japan, same sex marriage is not standard. And it's not permitted from the Japanese society. We should admit gay , lesbian and bisexual soon."
7156,"At first, I felt that these traffic lights were useful because it is important to respect the equality of all kinds of people and more people would be able to understand gays. However, considering safety, they are bad, because they will lead to traffic accidents. Drivers will not be able to concentrate on driving as well as pedestrians. Originally, traffic lights are set up in order to promote the safe driving, but those with hearts disturb it. Thus, the equality of gender should be asserted by other ways. For example, the advertisements of the same-sex couples can be put up on the walls of trains. Moreover, the media can have special sections about them, which will lead to the spread of the idea around the world. For these reasons, gay and straight traffic lights should not be used. Instead of them, the government should come up with other ways to emphasize the equality."
7157,"Same-sex couples are unusual to my thought. Maybe most of the Japanese think so. So I was interested in this topic. I think it is good idea to promote that same-sex couples are a normal reality by using pedestrian traffic lights. In japan, same-sex couples are becoming the topic of conversation. So I think it is good to take in such idea in japan to promote same-sex couples. I think same-sex couples are very fantastic.All the people are equal. So the thought that same-sex couples are bad is a mistaken idea. I hope the thought about same-sex couples is promoted."
7158,"I think the idea of the traffic lights is good. It's not usual to marry among same sex in Japan or many countries. So the idea will make the same sex marriage not unusual. Surely there are some problems about same sex marriage. But I think we should marry freely with someone they wanna marry. So if we make more ideas like traffic lights, it may be usual to marry among same sex marriage."
7159,"I agree that same-sex couples marry. People should be free to decide who they will marry. Admittedly, if they marry the same- sex person, they cannot have babies, which will lead to the decrease in the number of people in the world. This is a bad thing from a lot of points of view, such as economy. However, having the right to choose freely is more important. People should be equal in gender and age. Thus, they should marry someone they love. Today, many countries accept the marriage of the same- sex couples. Last year, Ireland finally accepted it. I hope this trend will spread around the world and that someday Japan will also accept it."
7160,I do not think this traffic light is good idea. Because it seems that the traffic light is forcing the new standard to people's thought. Moreover it seems brainwashing like Subliminal Effect (Working directly to people's thought by
7161,"I missed sending the reply. So I send the reply again. I do not think this traffic light is good idea. Because it seems that the traffic light is forcing the new standard to people's thought. Moreover it seems brainwashing like Subliminal Effect (Working directly to people's thought by repeatedly showing one idea). It is quite difficult to change people's old idea. So objections like in the article will continue to exist for a long time. In my opinion, they should announce other ideas that seem more straight forward."
7162,"I fear the worst state that North Korea develop and launch more nuclear weapons. Recently, North Korea develop its skills in nuclear weapons by financial support from any country. The nations diplomatically concerned in nuclear problems of North Korea such as America, South Korea, China, Russia, and Japan can't handle these bad situations. I don't understand other countries' diplomatic policy very much, but concerning Japanese foreign policy toward North Korea, I think Japanese government can't cooperate with other countries in consciousness toward nuclear problems of North Korea. For example, Japanese government put more importance on the abduction issue than nuclear issues by considering the feelings of victims and public opinion. The nations concerned in nuclear issues of North Korea should act in harmony as they could, though they have priority over their own nations' profit."
7163,"This problem is one of the most important issue in Japan. In our society, elderly people are supported mostly by young people. For example, Japanese pension system depends on young peoples work force. In near future, this system will fail. In fact, it is said that my generation will not receive pensions even if we pay money for pension. In my opinion, elderly people should support more other elderly people in order to reduce young people's burden. For example, elderly people should pay more percentage of medical bill."
7164,"This problem is one of the biggest issue for all Japanese,I think.And Japanese government should work on the problem more hardly. If population keep on decreasing as it is and the increasing of elderly people doesn't stop, Japanese economy will contract. Thus, the place where elderly people can work is more required. I think it is the best way that Japanese government make use of elderly people for the next generation. it is important to support a young man's child rearing at elderly people working."
7165,I was interested in this news.The issue of LGBT is very delicate in Japan. So I was surprised that pictures about gay or lesbian are used in public.I think this action by Vienna is great and courageous.It is important that society make efforts to eliminate prejudices about LGBT.
7166,"When I read this story ,I got angry. Because two victims doesn't matter for Kyozo Isohi. But he killed they. And he said he chose victims at random, he wanted to kill anyone so he would be sentenced to death. He is very irresponsibility. He should have death penalty."
7167,"Because I major in law, I'm curious about this article. I remember this law was enacted. There many people to use computer to download music illegally till 2012. Since that law has enacted, illegally downloading in computer has become decreasing. But I find new problem now. It's the place which downloading illegal music is changed from computer to smartphone. Nowadays, there are many illegal app to download music in smartphone. The new law can punish only illegally downloading in computer, not smartphone. Government should add the new law to punish illegal app. And also the new law can punish only person who know it is uploaded illegally. So it's hard to make a judgment which person know a app is illegal or not. I think it may takes a lot of time to solve this issue."
7168,"I thought the idea that started setting up rare traffic light is innovative. In japan, same sex couples are unacknowledged. So these couples are very rare. But in the world, the country that accredit same sex couples are increasing. So I think japan have to accredit same sex couples. Otherwise japan will be despise as underdeveloped country in this side by other country in the world."
7169,"I was surprised at this news. Recently the world society started to admit the same sex couples. However, in Japan , it is not immediate problems. Japanese people does not have good images to them ,so it is nice and creative idea to change the traffic light with the same sex couples. Because even though the people does not mater that kind of problem they are not interested in, people see the lights every day and they will start to think the same sex couples are normal."
7171,"At first , I felt this idea of traffic lights was strange. But , now that the existence of the sexual minorities is gradually recognized , I think of this idea as inventive. In Japan , Shibuya Ward , started giving official certificates to same-sex couples last year. But , the fact is that some people have strong hostilities against this trend. As written in this article , there are many problems . However, I think we should respect the rights to choose same-sex marriage."
7172,"I agree with the Idea that Japan 'needs to realize a society where aging people can participate in the labor market or in social activities' . Because it is not only to boost the economic growth in Japan, but also to connect with the society by continuing working. I have two grandfathers. One grandfather gave the work position to his son but he still go to the office and help the son. He talks many workers and still enjoy his daily life. On the other hand, my another grandfather retired the work and stay home all day every day. It means no connection to society and also people. He has to do nothing and he became lazy. Only thing he is looking forward to is seeing me. Through I saw both grandfathers, i think it is good idea for elder people to keep working."
7173,"I had never notice the traffic sign which can show so much until I read this news. Because the traditional gender identity is stuck in our mind so strongly maybe. So I think it is a meaningful action to the gender problem. Everyone has his or her freedom to choose happiness. Although it may take lots of money, I suppose the idea is creative and nice. It's important to show the right attitude to gender problem. The government can try various and more means in the future."
7174,"I think installing gay and straight traffic lights is nice idea. In today's society, people tend to have a prejudice against gay people. By installing gay motif to familiar things, I think people become to be interested in homosexuality and it will be good chance to think about gay people. I think depicting gay and straight on traffic lights expresses that gay people should not be discriminated but be treated equally. Gay and straight traffic lights will deepen people's understanding of gay people."
7175,"I was surprised at this traffic light. And I thought this idea is great. Because all people have the right to live with the person you like. Then, l think we spread this right to more people in the world. So, we need to think in broader perspective ."
7176,"I think Obama is a great leader. Because he has a wide perspective. There are some-sex couples in the world. But, It is not guaranteed their comfortable life, too. In that situation, Obama transmitted this opinion. I think his behavior encouraged some-sex couples in the world."
7177,"Japan has serious problems with the decreasing birthrate and aging of the population nowadays.I think Japan will become lifeless if this trend makes progress. I cannot say to young women in Japan,' you must bear more than two children.' But we need to think about 'future ' and act for 'future '."
7178,"When I was read this article ,I am surprised at 'gay and straight ' traffic lights. Because I don't know that mainly of practicing nation promote same-sex couples in Japan . I think it is good idea . The design is to attract the attention of all road users ,both drivers and pedestrians. So the idea that same-sex couples are a normal spread all over the country. In my opinion, we ought to be a little more lenient with same-sex couples."
7179,"North Korea should not do such an action.Such a launch only make their condition worse and worse.However,it is difficult to lead them not to do.People who are top of North Korea won't change their idea.People who live in North Korea can't know their condition because of shutting down information.I hope North Korea come to pursue the peace."
7180,"I reckon it is a good idea to recognize same-sex couple socially and movements like this are really important. However, I can't understand why the place displaying such movements is traffic lights. Originally, in order to facilitate the safe driving, they are placed. In my opinion, it is bad that some criticism rises in something regarding safety like signal. So Australian government should reconsider other ways to support minorities such as lesbian, gay, and so on."
7181,"I was surprised to see the traffic lights. In some European countries or in Canad, the marriage of same-sex couples is accepted. However, in most of the countries, it is not accepted by law and besides there is prejudice against same-sex couples. So I think the idea of the new traffic lights in Austria is very good to eliminate the prejudice and to protect human rights of freedom. I think it is needed to eliminate the prejudice by every means available in Japan."
7182,"Though this is the article from 4 years ago, North Korea still continues to launch many rockets in spite of the criticism from other countries. Those rockets didn't hit any country fortunately, but it might be too late if a rocket hits a country. So we should check the trends about North Korea continuously."
7183,"I expect that the issue of North Korea will be peacefully solved. From May 6 , North Korea held political party convention after thirty six years of separation. It shows that economy is getting better than before. Therefore, North Korea will try to make an improvement in the relationship with neighbor countries. I hope that North Korea will become a peaceful country."
7184,"I think this problem is too serious. Japanese society doesn't hold without young people. If the elderly increase , people who can work decrease and increase money that the country put out to public. I think that Japan's economy has a serious problem in this situation. In my opinion,the country needs supports to give birth to a child in order to solve this problem."
7185,I think new traffic lights great. Because they are very novelty and funny. Some developed countries accept the marriage of same sex couples. Today it is said 10 percent of people are homosexuality. Therefore Japan should make a law that allow the marriage of same sex and install the gay and straight traffic lights.
7186,I think US is very advanced about homosexuality. 50% of Americans were in favour of legalising gay marriage. I guess there are few people accepting the same sex marriage in Japan. Because there are some bad reason. For example gay couple can not get babies. But all people have a freedom of marriage. So Japan should make a law to accept the same sex marriage.
7187,"I was surprised at the content of this article. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of inequality all over the world. For example,the minorities such as gay and straight are regarded as aberrant,and a lot of people discriminate against them. However,in recent years,more and more people are paying attention to the topic of equality and equal treatment. The discrimination against the minority is being eliminated. I think it is important for us to struggle to make our society more equal."
7188,"I think it is very good idea,because it's personality.No matter what everyone say,don't worry about it.I think that Austria is more tolerance than Asia.It is very important thing to respect personality.I think that Japan should more accept same-sex couple,and can marry them.Then,Japan should spread thoughts that general acceptance gender identity in Asia."
7189,"I think those new traffic lights are wonderful, because originally the role of governments is securing the nation's freedom and promoting equality. Therefore those traffic lights which the Vienna Government set to eliminate sex discrimination are not a waste of tax. Actually there must be people who can't accept a sexual diversity, and it is a matter of course. However, at least human rights of sexual minorities have to be respected."
7190,"I want to be a lawyer. So I know the standpoint of legal circles. Now, their standpoint agree with homosexuality but disagree with same-sex marriage. I think there is this difference whether Japan as a nation change law to authorize same-sex marriage or not. So It is great to set the new design signals!In Asia, especially Japan understand about homosexuality so little that we have to appeal for importance of it. I wish the equal right to consider them in the same heterosexuality-couples for same-sex couples will come true in Japan."
7191,"I think this is very dangerous problem.We should be support elderly people who can work more some years.And we must support young people.Nowadays,women work as hard as men,so they are difficult to give birth to a baby.And Japanese population decrease.It is vicious cycle.That's why,I think we should support elderly people can work more year ,first.And we must support job of young people ,especially women can give birth to a baby in peace."
7192,"I think equality and equal treatment is really important. But I don't think it is worth costing such big money, because this traffic lights' role is same as normal traffic lights. The role is telling 'stop' and 'go' . I think they don't have to be some illustrating. I wonder if there were any other good way , more practical one."
7193,"It is very regrettable that such an unreasonable crime was happened. It true that we have to think carefully about Japanese death penalty and this man's background, but I think there is more important thing to care about.I think We tend to forget Killed people and their family and friends."
7194,"I am surprised to know that the population of people aged 65 or over will reach nearly 40% of Japan's population in 2060. If this became true, young people have to work very hard in order to sustain Japanese society and elderly people's life. I think Japanese company should offer more chance to work for elderly people. By working, elderly people can earn money and become to buy things actively and then, Japanese economy becomes active. Working is good for their health, too. I think Japanese society's aging is inevitable, so we should think about good way how to live with elderly people and sustain Japanese economy."
7195,"Their life never back. The news will fade out of our concern soon, but bereaved family's anger and sadness lasts forever. Who can solve it?"
7197,"The traffic lights which depict a man and a woman, others, two women, and still others, two men are good idea. Especially in Japan, the fixed idea about same sex couples or marriages is still deeply rooted. However, we should evaluate other people equally. So, such ideas should be accepted. I hope the fixed idea comes to weak gradually."
7198,"I was surprised at this article because so many people accept the new signal. In many countries, including Japan, people tend to complain about the cost, its political implication, and so on. We, Japanese people, should think more about these issues and the government should take some measures."
7199,"The question about whether choosing mother or girlfriend has no answer. I think the man should save the one first he can easily or quickly save. Every person's live is equal, so trying to save mother instead of girlfriend is not always the right answer."
7200,"When I read this article, I just thought the lights installed in Vienna were nice because lately I have been thinking about the importance of equality of all people including homosexual people. And the lights actually promoted the idea that same-sex couples are a normal in the city. Not to mention, that is awesome."
7201,"We should think about Japan's economy in the future,because this problem can make Japan's economy worse. If the proportion of people aged 65 or over reach nearly 40%,more and more burdens will be imposed on young people. As a result,young people would regard saving money as important and pay less money. As this shows,aging society can cause various problems. We need to tackle this problem seriously."
7202,"I am very interested in North Korea. The country held the party congress a few days ago. It is attracting attention around the world. Also, In this year, North Korea carried out a nuclear test and fired a missile. The country has confused the world community. United States, South Korea, Japan, and other countries should try to make an improvement of relations by conversation. The conversation is needed and very important in future."
7203,"In Japan, we are not so open minded to gay couples, so I did not think that there are such gender equality societies in the world. I think it is a good idea because we need to get used to the image of gay couple to think that it is a usual thing. I consider the reason why some of us feel strange when seeing gay couples is because we have never experienced that kind of situation. Japanese traffic lights now shows a single walking person so changing them might cost too much, but we need to make some effort to get used to different types of sexualities and understand their lifestyles."
7205,"I thought that the idea is novelty and interesting. Traffic lights is a good choice to create people's images in a daily life because everyone will see it if we go out. However, I believe that most of people likes other-sex. I am worrying that this signal will lead to recommendation of same-sex couples. I don't think it is bad, but to be honest, I don't want my children to love same gender person. I feelings became complicated."
7206,"When I read this article,I felt that this idea is novel. In Japan,The homosexuality is a sensitive topic.So,I thought that it was a taboo subject too much. But this signal gives an opportunity to think about homosexuality to us.I think that it is important to think by oneself.This is a nice idea."
7207,"I think this is a serious problem. The main consequence of this problem will be the increased burden of young workers.The day will come when there will be less than a young worker for every pensioner. The Japanese government should take measures to solve this problem. For example, they should improve the working conditions of women.this will help women have a baby."
7208,"This article have written 4 years ago but I really think that young generations have less skills to write Kanji than the old days. This problem occurs not only at Japanese but also at English. Young people in America uses 'texting' so spelling skills is decreasing. However, I think we have to think this change as a kind of development. We have to write more Kanji and keep the writing skills, but at the same time, we don't have to think this problem so serious."
7210,"North Korea's action is very interesting. It costs much money to do their appeal of military force and the action make their people's hungry getting worse. I wonder why they are suffering from their own action all the way. Certainly, their nuclear missiles or rocket can be felt fear to many people and their nuclear missile will be threat of war or terrorism. But, this is not rational way. The thing only one team win money, people and lands from war makes almost of people sad, so they had better to abandon the nuclear arms and establish friendships with country, include U.S. and Japan."
7211,"I think some traffic lights in Austria which is 4 gender type couples is effective idea to understand gender problem in the world. When I was a high school student, I heard 'Gender should be gradation.' This opinion is suitable for global world I think. If someones have religious issue, they may be able to learn it. I hope for the day coming when everyone can express their love free."
7212,"I think North Korea is out of control. The leader of this country is trying to beat other countries and his threat upsets a peace of the world. Moreover he imposes a dictatorship so the citizens are crying with hunger. Though they are suffering, the government invests their money in a nuclear program. What a terrible thing this is ! We must try to solve this problem. We need to cooperate with other countries in order to stop this bad situation."
7213,"This article was written in 2012, but now,2016, North Korea has not changed. North Korea fired missiles or rockets over 5 times in 2016. These are improved , and today, whose performance is much better than that of 2012. North Korea threatens our lives in that peace.But some countries can't control it. So we might be faced on the time when we should think the way of solving Korean problem expect economic sanctions."
7214,"I was surprised very much when I read this article because homosexual is uncommon thought for us. Of course, some countries accept same-sex marriage in the world. However, many countries and Japan do not recognize by the law. Therefore, I think this action in Austria offers a better opportunity for us because It will have a chance to think about homosexual. Thus I expect the movement about homosexual to last forever."
7215,"This is a very serious problem. To be sure, it is necessary to create a society where elderly people can continue working in order to stop economic decline. However, I think it is more important to stop declining birthrate. It is caused by the tendency to marry late. I'm often heard that gradual participating business fields by women leads to it. So Japanese government should establish policies which enable women to nurse their children continuing their jobs."
7216,"North Korea is a very closed , isolated country. The people in this country are controlled by the power of Labor Party. Now, Kim Jong-un , the leader of North Korea is trying to have all sorts of power . Not to mention , I think China plays an important role to solve North Korea's problems. But , I think Japan or the USA should do more things. It's difficult to make North Korea a normal country , but we can do it by teaching local people how their country really are . And It's important to tell more information about foreign country."
7218,"I do not like North Korea because their action is aggressive and scary. North Korea launched many rockets in the past. Not only that, they do experiments on the nuclear weapon now. We will suffer serious damage if they fight using those weapons. Therefore, We must solve this problem immediately. Thus I think that We think seriously and must talk about them."
7219,"I was interested in this article and I think that it is good movement. In Japan,same-sex couples are discriminated.Even member of parliament says same-sex couples are abnormal.I hope that the movement spared all over the world."
7220,I've posted a comment about the 2012 archive by mistake.
7221,"At first, I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is fact that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans, but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe.Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored. Recently, EU has a lot of issues caused by Non-peaceful world. Synchronized terrorist attacks in France, it affected all European who think terrorism is other people's affairs. So I want mutual understanding each nation through this situation of facing crisis."
7222,"I think this movement is very creative.Now it has been talking about LGBT,but not so much organization do any action for it. So I think Vienna is one of a pioneer,and this action gives opportunity to think about it for many people."
7223,"I think North Korea is only isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts,too.North Korea should not do this action another country being scared,and we have to solve this problem immediately.Now,Japan needs a high negotiation skill to do it."
7224,"I think this idea is silly and this attempt is just a waste of money. The government should spend a lot of money on more constructive projects such as social welfare or environmental beautification.It is true that the topic of equality and equal treatment about various couples is important.However,this government policy is not cost-effective.In reality,who cares about traffic lights at crossings?I suspect it is only self-satisfaction or hypocrisy of politicians and the general public.If you want to realize the genuine world of equality,you should consider steps toward it seriously instead of taking this easy way."
7225,"This news was very sad news and what is worse,North Korea has not changed for five years.We Japanese,however,can interpret this situation as a good chance.For the seventy years since Japan's defeat in World War II,Japanese people have considered it a taboo to discuss national security in public,but now North Korea is lowering the hurdles by increasing the risk of national security in East Asia.We should take this chance effectively,not miss it."
7226,"I agree with same sex marriage. I know many people still disagree with it, because it seems something unusual. But now, we are facing a lot of problems which did not appear in old days. So we should develop new thinking way. We should change our ideas."
7227,"Nowadays I wonder that the occasion to see LGBT people on TV is increasing. In past time, the discrimination to them may be extremer than that of present days. The people who think them strange undoubtedly exist, but the number of them is decreasing. The trials in the article is very interesting. They help getting rid of persecution of LGBT people. In Japan, the first bylaw for the rights of homogenous couples started, so Japan will be tolerant country for them."
7230,"I was so moved by this story. Although it is so hard to complete the marathon even for the people whose limbs are not paralyzed like me, I think terrific that she didn't give up running during the race. I often give up in the middle of things, but I was moved to try to finish what I have decided to do after reading this story. Also, her family's support was important for her challenge. They should be awarded as well."
7232,I got angry when I read the news. To kill anyone is really bad things unless they have any reasons. There are many problems about killing people. And I think it won't be disappear in the future. But I hope the society in Japan will be better and the number of people who kills anyone or themselves decrease more.
7233,"I think it is important to take such actions to prevent these illegal download behavior. It associate to the music producers' benefit. When I lived in China, I had been download music illegally as all Chinese as usual. I think government should take measures and press should publicize the correct knowledge about download music."
7234,"I think this is a good idea to interest more people for same-sex marriage. Surely,this campaign cost a lot of money. However,the government should spend money on people who like the same sex people and troubled."
7235,"I was very interested in the news. I think the new traffic light shows the new era that everyone is accepted. I think this is wonderful, and the trend that everyone is accepted is likely to spread."
7236,This news surprised me a lot. This is because the fact that North Korea launched a rocket may lead to breaking The World War Ⅲ. I think many countries such as U.S.A. should provide North Korea developing the army.
7237,"I'm so sad to read this article because I really think Kanji is one of the most important cultures of Japan. Not to mention, now we don't have to write by myself thanks to smart phones, PC or something... I think It's not good to depend on those technologies too much."
7238,"I think this trend is depressing. The kanji is Japanese important identity. The government should make the Japanese be able to write more kanji. For example,they use less email other than work and write letters by hand."
7274,I think this news shows that the evolution of the technology increases the possibility that we can help an Il person . I think that a person with a disability can enjoy more sports if elaborate and highly efficient artificial arm and artificial leg was made .
7285,"In modern society, many people use PC or smartphones or anymore, thanks to them it is not need to write Kanji correctly. When we write a paper or send e-mails, these are grate helps. When we tell some words of similar meaning, these gives difference for such some words. And I sometimes feel I'm losing ability. But Kanji is Japanese important culture and we have been keeping up this tradition since Kanji was transmitted from China about 1800 years ago. So we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji with hand. I want to tell this contents as a person of 'calligrapher'"
7296,"I was really moved to read this heartwarming news. Full marathon is very hard for us all, even people with a normal , healthy body. I think her difficulties and hardness to run the marathon and practice walking and running were stronger than we can expect. Her achievement gave me courage to challenge something that I think impossible."
7299,"Kanji is the most important Japanese culture,so we should expand this culture around the world. I think that the Japanese government should cooperation this culture."
7301,"I think this trend is serious problem. If continue this situation,Japanese are declining. So government have to introduce strict education."
7304,"The news is wonderful.Mr.Miura's challenge gave the courage to me. I might've been moved,if Mr.Miura were very very tough or healthy man.However,he has broken his pelvis and left thigh and has also had a number of operations on his heart. This is why I am moved so strongly."
7305,"I agree with your opinion because I think that people 's lives are equal and they should be treated equally,too. The idea is ethical legally."
7306,"When I read this article,I am so exciting! Although Climbing Mt Everest needs much stamina and strong mental for young people,Mr.Miura did it at 89 years! His challenging mind is not easy to try for normal people. Mr.Miura teaches us the importance of challenging by his action."
7307,I was surprised at this news.I thought that it is too hard for a man who is 80 years old to climb Mt.Everest but Mr.Miura made it.This news teaches us that we can't be too old to challenge what we want to do .
7308,"I was surprised at this news. My grandfather is as old as Mr.Miura. But my grandfather cannot walk without cane. So I cannot image this episode. And I was touched to his bravery. Although he experienced a number of injuries and operations, he challenged his limits. If I were him, I couldn't do this behavior. So I was very impressed with him."
7310,I was very surprised at this news. Because he climbed the highest mountain in the world at age of 80 although he broke his pelvis and thigh before. Generally people over the age of 80 cannot climb the mountains like Everest. Moreover some people cannot recover and walk after serious operations or breaking their legs. I think health is the most important thing in the life. Therefore we should take good care of ourselves like Yuichiro Miura.
7311,"When I heard this news, I was proud of Yuichiro Miura as the same Japanese. And I respected him, considering his age and his injury. Of course, It is difficult to keep one's body healthy around 80 years old. But I think it is hard to have goals and keep making an effort to realize the goals, too. I really respected his thought of keeping challenging his limit."
7312,"I was very surprised when I heard this news. I think it is very hard for 80-years-old person to climb Mount Everest, but Yuichiro Miura accomplished it. I respect him because he is challenging his limit . It is important to keep the health of the body , so I think that we should continue challenging the limit like Yuichiro Miura."
7313,"I was really surprised at this news. I thought 80-year-old man was too old to climb mountains.What impressed me most about this news was that Mr Miura had not given up to his challenge. I learned that even if we become old people who can't move freely, we shouldn't give up our life. I thought we can't expect the limits of our own ability, then we can enjoy our life sufficiently like Mr Miura."
7314,"I have heard this news before.When I hear this news first, I cannot believe. Young people is no more hard to climb Mt.Everest than Mr.Miura is. From my view, he was very tough. But he wrote on his web site 'If the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth, one can never be happier,' It makes me realize to have a courage to pursue my dream and it's happy to fulfill own dreams. I had many times to make excuses to try to give up my dream. I think Mr.Miura wants to testify 'It's never too late.' And also the article means we shouldn't give up own dream because of age. I was impressed by him.From today,I'm not to make excuses. I want to be person who don't have a limit like Mr.Miura."
7315,"I think Mr.Miura is amazing man. Even for young people, scaling Mount Everest is very difficult and severe challenge. I was impressed by his attitude not thinking about his age and hesitating. I think scaling Mount Everest needs not only physical strength but also perseverance, so Mr.miura's achievement is extraordinary when consider his age. I am proud of Mr.Miura as the same Japanese. I respect his challenging spirit. When I become 80 years old, I want myself to find the thing which I am enthusiastic about and tackle it cheerfully. From now on, I want to do my best to the things which I decide to do and not give up before doing. With perseverance, I want to challenge my limit."
7316,"I agree with your opinion. I also will not be able to choose which one to save in such situation. I think that people's lives are equal and they should be treated equally. I believe that the most important thing for law students is fairness. This question is too difficult to answer perfectly, but it should be thought deeply."
7317,"I agree with your opinion.When we visit foreign country, it is important to learn culture and religion in the country."
7318,I was very surprised and encouraged when I read this news.Because he climbed the highest mountain in the world though he was 80 years old.The cause that he managed it is the heart that he wanted not to be defeated by the other climber.I think it is important to do something as I want not to be defeated by others.
7320,"I think so too, I wonder it is very hard for 80-years-old person to climb Mount Everest at first. But after I read this news, I have an thought that our physical healthy is depend on mental condition. It may be important that we keep own dream or goal to live longer!"
7322,"I have ever heard about this news before, but I haven't known that he had climbed Mt. Everest three times. No matter how old he is, it is so difficult to climb Mt.Everest that I can find how great he is. Although we often hear the phrase of 'it cannot be too late to start something', I use to think that there is a limit actually. But Yuichiro Miura realize the phrase is real. I was impressed by his toughness."
7323,"I'm also fond of driving a car. Since I got a driving license, I want to use a car no matter where I go. Needless to say, it is important to reduce the number of traffic accident. But an automatic driving system will prevent us, male all over the world, showing a driving skill to female. That is a little sad."
7324,"This article move my heart .Yuichiro Miura, who climbed Everest when he was 70 and then again at 75. I think that it's very hard for Mr,Miura who is 75 years to climb Mt,Everest. But he made the climb twice. He challenge his limit . I think I want to challenge my limit ."
7325,"When I read this article, I was surprised and also be moved.I really respected his attitude to keep on trying difficult challenge even his old age. And also I was proud of Yuichiro Miura as a Japanese. I think It difficult to keep one's healthy body for people over 70 years old. However We are 19years old.We are much younger than him. All university student in Japan should this article and we have to realize that we are surrounded by good opportunity to try any challenge."
7326,"Reading this news, I was amazed and respect Mr.Miura. I guess it is so difficult to climb the world' highest mountain at the age of 80. For even young people, this would be hard. A lot of trouble would happen through the climbing, but he made it. After hearing he was proud of himself, I felt that I wanted to try something and feel it, too. Thus, someday I will try the marathon in Hawaii."
7327,"I read the comment, and agree with your opinion. Surely,it is very convenient for almost people.But it is also a fear for people too.I am afraid of the tendency that people try to make anything Automation.Even if a big accident is caused by automatic driving car, a driver cannot blame a machine. And who will pay compensation to victim.It is very difficult question."
7328,I was surprised to read this article. Yuichiro Miura climbed Everest though he was 70 years old. It is very difficult for old people to climb. I think even young people can't climb the mountains as usual. I haven't challenged my limit. But he challenged his limit twice. So I want to challenge my limit when I will be his age.
7330,I was very surprised when I read this article first.It's very good thing to challenge big purpose no matter how taking the old. It gave courage to people all over the world. I hope that he continue to challenge in the future.
7331,"He achieved the brilliant feat of climbing Everest. It is amazing that an 80-year-old Japanese mountaineer could climb Everest. How powerful he is! If I were he,I couldn't climb the mountain. So,I was very surprised to read this article. I'm looking forward to his further development."
7332,"I knew that Yuichiro Miura has climbed Mt.Everest many times before I read this article , but I've been just amazed to know that he'll climb again. Now, he is eighty , and I can hardly imagine that I would be able to doing such a difficult challenge. I tend to give up something to do easily , so I want to learn from his attitude. And like a Yuichiro's challenge , I thought that the help of family or other supporters is very important to achieve a goal."
7334,"I was very surprised to know that Miura Yuichiro ,80,reached the summit of Mt.Everest.At the same time ,I felt that the age did not matter when we challenged big things. I avoided challenging a new thing for fear of failure so far.I read this article,I thought that it was not good to decide a limit in myself. I wanted to become the person that an unreachable splendid achievement is accomplished like Miura Yuichiro."
7335,"I didn't know about this news before I watched the Japanese TV show Down Town Now. When I watched it, first i could not believe this fact, because the age of 80 is so old that I never to think the man 80 can climb Mt. Everest. Getting to know about Mr. Miura, I came to respect him. He always trains a lot. For example, he often wears shoes which are used when he climb.The shoes weight about 5. In addition, he shoulders his backpack which is also weight. He is great!!!! I hope he keeps his health good."
7336,I agree with you. I also want him to try his limits again.
7337,"I agree with you.I respect him too,and I hope that we continue challenging like him."
7338,"I agree with him.The 3D printer is surely convenient.This enables anyone to easily create complicated apparatuses.However,it means that anyone becomes able to make a dangerous weapon.For world security, I felt that it was important that I used the convenient tool definitely."
7339,I agree with ID1313. I think 3Dprinter is very useful invention. We should not place a ban the 3Dprinter because it can product the gun easily. Alarming thing is to spread the gun's blue print.
7340,I watched the movie ' Everest' last week and I thought Everest is the place human beings must not enter.Many people have been killed by this mountain.So I really admired Mr.Miura's achievements. I want to be a cool elderly person who has objectives like Mr.Miura.
7341,"I thought it was a really wonderful thing to climb Everest by 80 years old. I learned wonderful of challenging the limit at this news.I'd like to try the limit like Mr. Mimura, too.When doing that, I think more many things can be learned."
7342,"I agree with you.I respect Mr.Miura ,too."
7343,"Reading this article, I was really surprised at that Mr. Miura reached the top of Mt. Everest at the age of 80. I can't actually know how hard it was, but I know it must be a harsh challenge. He let us know that we should keep on challenging."
7344,This is unbelievable story. When I read it for the first time I was so surprised. I think Mr. Miura trained so hard. I respect him. Because I am so lazy and hate hard thing. But I was encouraged by him. So I will do my best from tomorrow.
7345,"I think so too. North Korea can be threat to Japan. We should think about this problem seriously. If North Korea try to launch missiles again,we need to take strong measures against North Korea."
7347,"I know Mt. Everest is really dangerous and difficult to climb, many people have died by trying Mt. Everest. But Yuichiro Miura made it, even he was 80 . I can' t expect how hard it was for him to climb , but it is clear that he gave me a courage to challenge something looks impossible."
7348,"It unbelievable that he will climb again!! I thought we should learn from his attitude , too."
7349,I agree with the opinion. Because North Korea will continue to fire other rockets in the future. North Korea frightens other country's people now. We should cope with the problem now more than ever.
7350,"I was really moved by his great achievement. It is very difficult to reach the summit of Mount Everest even for young people, but he did that when he was 80 years old. This is unbelievable triumph. I guess that he cannot forgive himself if he fails to accomplish something which he once decided to carry out. I want to learn his mentality and i also want to be a man who accomplish something which he once decided to carry out."
7351,"I knew Yuichiro Miura by watching the news about him last year. When I knew about his record , I was very surprised. I have grandfather whose age is 80, but he cannot walk well. Though Yuichiro Miura is also 80, he climbed Mount Everest. If I were in his place , I could not reach the summit. I admire him very much. I want to do something great at 80 like him in the future. He is fantastic."
7352,I agree with you. He is so powerful. I want to do something great in the future.
7353,"I was very surprised at his strong vitality for his age when I read this article. I prospect that the thing which encourage him is his identity. Recently, a lot of young people tend not to have their own dreams and challenge anything. So, they should imitate him and challenge their limits in a variety of fields."
7354,"I think it is one of the impressive achievements for a man to climb Mt. Everest at the age of 80. The reason is because it is even difficult to go jogging for an ordinary 80 year old person. However Yuichiro Miura completed an even more difficult challenge. He absolutely gives energy to elder people all over the world, but also encourages the young generation to have lifetime hobbies. He continues his adventure even at his age. Though I am not into climbing mountains, however I would like to find some hobbies that I can keep continuing until I am 80."
7355,I agree that we do need to pay attention to the same sex couples. However most of the Japanese TV programs tend to make laugh of those kind of people. So I think it is very difficult to change Japanese peoples mind to think that they are not different. Do you have any idea to make people understand and get used to them?
7356,"When I read this article, I was moved. To keep trying without drawing a line is very important not only for me as belonging sports club, but also for us as model for how to live. If we give up challenging our limits, we cannot know how our best performances show. Of course, it is no problem if you are not interested in that. However, that life will be petty, I think. To be simply dedicate to practicing sports, study and so on, and challenge your limit whether good consequence or not will be supposed to be the brightest and most fun memories in your life and make your confidence."
7357,"I think his challenge is always the pride of mankind. Actually his attitude to life is bright hope for not only senior citizens but also all of us. I expect Mr.Miura and his many rivals compete each other, and I hope someday the world record will be beaten."
7358,"I'm proud that he is a Japanese. His spirit of challenging limit himself is teaches us 'Never give up' and 'Old age won't be failure', and he gave us some impress not only Japanese but also people over the world. I respect him in that his brave and enthusiasm for climbing to overcome some surgery. I would like to be a person who master one thing like Miura."
7359,I agree with you. His battles against nature and diseases are really respectable.
7360,"I already knew him because of watching news and variety program on TV. So I have respected him since then. I remind some book like biography written by him after I read this article. In the book, he said he wants to challenge his limit, and wants to know the powerful charm of life. I noticed meanings of his message. it's definite aim as the human being to accomplish something you want to try. So I feel that I have to make some efforts to find myself what I want to try in my life."
7361,"I agree with you. I think if I am eighty-year-old, I can't climb Mt.Everest, too. and I feel so amazing after reading this article, too."
7362,"I think we should have to follow local people's rules when we are travel abroad.However, in case of religion we should consider carefully. People have each creed, and it should not be infringed. I insist that nation guarantee foreigner's religion."
7363,"His achievement is impossible for the general public and amazing. In general, the older we get, the harder we walk. For all this, he reached the top of the mountain. In my opinion, why he could do this is that he made arduous effort for building up his physical health everyday. And such attitude is an example for us to emulate."
7364,"This idea was so interesting and innovative. Probably, not so many people interest in traffic lights design. I think this new style of traffic lights show us not only same-sex couples problems ,but also attention for risk of traffic accident. I hope these advanced traffic lights will come to japan someday."
7365,I was really surprised this article. I never thought that such a old man reach the world highest mountain. Even a man who is healthy and young enough might fail climbing Everest.The another reason I was surprised is he is Japanese.I decide that I will keep my body tough until old age and find something I want to challenge then.
7366,I was surprised at this article. Mr Miura climbed Everest at 80 years old. Climbing Everest is very tight for general people. Mr Miura is very tough and strong mental. I can't imitate his doing. I want to be a tough man who is like Mr Miura.
7368,"These guys are crazy. To be honest, I have heard many times about this kind of news--an old man climbed the high mountain, so I was not surprised of this news. I also know that climbing mountains is dangerous. Some people have died on mountain. This is why I thought 'these guys are crazy'. If I were 80, I will challenge to another things which will not threat my life. However, Mr. Miura did it. He has a huge courage and strong will. To achieve something, maybe we should be crazy."
7369,"I really respect Mr. Miura about his courage and his young attitude to life. I hope I will keep a young adventurous soul which is brave enough to take dangerous challenges at my 70,80 age too. What is more, the physical health is vital too. We cannot climb such a high mountain with a weak body. We should keep doing exercise to remain a strong healthy body as well."
7370,"When I read this article, I was surprised very much and I felt admiration . It is because he gets too much old to climb Mt. Everest. My grandmother is the same age with him. However, she cannot climb Mt. Takao let alone Mt. Everest. Thus, I respect him very much. Therefore, I want to keep my youthful appearance well into later life."
7372,"I was really moved by his great achievement. It is very difficult to reach the summit of Mount Everest even for young people, but he did that when he was 80 years old. This is unbelievable triumph. I guess that he cannot forgive himself if he fails to accomplish something which he once decided to carry out. I want to learn his mentality and i also want to be a man who accomplish something which he once decided to carry out."
7373,"I was surprised to read this news. I was impressed by his very strong body and soul because even though it is so hard to climb Mt. Everest being as young as I am, he did. His challenge must give many people courage, so it should be known to much more people around the world."
7375,"After I have read this article, I thought he is a great man!! This is because he is 80 years old. I don't know If I can live until 80, much less claim the mountain as high as Mt. Everest. I should take care of my health and live as long as he is now to accomplish something special."
7376,I agree with you. I learned that we shouldn't give up own dream because of age at this news.
7377,"I thought Mr.Miura leads a full life.Recently,many Japanese people retiring from their jobs lose their goals and lead a boring life.If you want to enjoy the rest of your life,you should find your goal like him."
7378,"It is difficult to achieve something great. However,nothing will be gained if you give up something to do easily. So,we need to do our best to realize our own dream."
7379,"I agree with your opinion. In capitalistic country, it is difficult for the poor to get a job with guaranteed high income because they cannot spend enough money on education. This vicious circle must be stopped. So I think we have to think about Japanese economy too."
7381,I agree with your opinion. I think the developed country should review an environmental problem and do it smoothly.
7382,"When I read this article, I was very moved and thought it is important to challenge the limits regardless of our age. Mr.Miura didn't give up, and he climbed at the top of Mt.Evelest. So, he really felt the sense of achievement no one around the world can't feel. I have a long future, I should continue trying without giving up."
7383,"When I read this article , I was surprised at the success of Yuichiro Miura because it is very difficult for such a old man to reach the summit of Mount Everest . I think he is a very great Japanese. Like him, when I am 80 years old, I would like to scale Mt Everest."
7384,"I didn't know this news , so I was very surprised! It is hard to climb Mt.Everest. Even young people often give up climbing this mountain. But Yuichiro Miura was 80 years old when he reached the summit. I was moved by his powerful body and spirit.I can't imagine what I will be doing when I am 80 years old.But, I want to continue trying something."
7385,"I agree with you. I think this is very difficult problem. US military facilities should not be concentrated in Okinawa. We should consider the terrible past of Battle of Okinawa. But , at the same time, we should watch out the advance of China in South China Sea. Given these serious facts, we should discuss this problem carefully."
7386,"When I read the article at the first time, I thought he must be a superman. Even we, the young, never can climb Mt.everest without hard training. However he is over 70. We only focus on success to climb, however he must make much effort for the challenge. I really respect him. He is a native challenger. I want to be a challenger and keep on train me."
7387,"I agree with you. The words Miura said touch me. I learned that it does not matter how old I am,when I try anything."
7390,I knew this news before I read this article. But I didn't know detailed story of him. I was surprised that he has a good rival 'Sherchan'. I think his power comes from existence of his rival. To have a good rival is fantastic things of the man. So I want to have a good rival of him.
7391,"I agree with you. In this world, there are many poor people and they need money to live. Buying a picture won't save this world and it is a shame to other people who don't have such money."
7392,"When I read this news, I was so surprised. I learned the importance of a spirit of challenging. Of course I paid tribute to his climbing but I surprised at him because of other reason. I surprised at an fact : he challenged this after he receive a serious injury. After reading this, I wanted to know more about him and I searched about him more. Then I knew that he has made a lot of challenges and he has gotten many titles, for example, best in the world , world-first and etc. He has gotten honor as a skier but he wasn't satisfied and he continued to aim the top more. I think it's the most difficult not to be satisfied. I will aim the next goal of a goal referring him."
7393,"North Korea is isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts, and is wasting its money on weapons and propaganda displays while the North Korean people go hungry. They should use the money for food to save its citizens, not for launching missiles. But they probably launch the missile. So every countries pay attention to missiles."
7394,I agree with you
7395,I was moved by his challenge because he didn't stop challenging although he is so old. I really want to have the mind like his. I want to climb Mt.Everest and see the scene he have seen.
7396,I agree with you. I think the view is the most beautiful in the world.
7397,"As everyone mentioned above, I was really surprised at and moved by his great achievement. If I were him I would not and could not do that. I just want to praise him for his great achievement."
7398,"I think this news is wonderful. Mr Miura is very old, but he challenged his limit and finally break his limit. If I am going to be very old, I maybe can't do those things. So I think he is respectful person in the world."
7399,I completely agree with you!! I desperately wish to have a strong mind just like him.
7400,I agree with you. His challenge made us surprised.
7401,"I was surprised 'the limit of age80' in this article. I think It isn't necessary that the limit of age 80 is at the summit of Mt. Everest, the highest place on earth. Rather I think only the person who can take responsibility for one's physical condition management should be allowed to foot in the dangerous area."
7402,I agree with your opinion. Mr Miura's challenge made us touching. So his challenge is worthy of praise.
7403,"I agree with you. After I read this article, I also think I want to challenge my limit too."
7405,"I was surprised to hear this story. It is great job for 80-year-old man to make it to the top of Mt Everest. Also, I want to challenge my limits."
7406,I agree with you. I never imagine how wonderful I climb Mt.Everest and see the scene.
7407,"I think that my ability to write character is declining these days. I think that to keep the ability, we need to write character by our hands when we write report, memo, and so on."
7408,"I agreed with your opinion. Everyone is equal. China's ministry of justice said to save his mother over his girlfriend.Of course, saving both of them is the best.However, when it is inevitable, whether we should save mother or girlfriend depends on the circumstances and the individuals. Also, If I were him, I should be upset. So, I think the Chinese justice is not true justice."
7409,I was surprised to see the headline of the news.Because I have never thought that the 30% of the Japan's electricity is nuclear.We haven't thought about its danger until it faces us by earthquakes and tunami.We should think about the other ways that provide electricity with us instead of the nuclear.I hope that scientists find out the new ways .
7410,"This problem is very important for Japan and Japanese future. Because generating renewable energy is one of the most important for Japanese who depends on electric appliances. Japan doesn't have much money for using energy,so I think that Japan has to find cheap and lasting energy."
7411,My grandfather is also as old as Mr. Miura. So I cannot believe his episode too. I sympathize with your comment.
7412,"Since the Fukushima disaster in March, I am afraid of nuclear power.Therefore , nuclear power is stopped, and I think that we should use renewable energy . The development of geothermal and solar is expected to further advance ."
7413,"I think we should use nuclear power plants. Because economy of Japan depends on manufacturing. For general families, increasing electricity cost might not be a big problem. However, for manufacturing companies, it is a matter of life or death. Therefore, Japan should restart using nuclear electricity at the moment. By the way, it is the fact that some people are afraid of nuclear power plants. So in order to replace nuclear power to renewable energy in the future, Japanese government should commit some money to exploiting renewable energy side by side."
7414,"Of course using only renewable energy is an ideal way because it can be used forever and it doesn't pollute environment. But it is so difficult for current Japan to realize that that all we can do now is using renewable energy effectively as much as possible with relying on nuclear power. abolishing nuclear power plants suddenly cannot be realistic, so it is important to reduce the number of them by taking advantage of renewable energy. This solution is realistic, kind to environment, and safe."
7415,"Because I live in Yokosuka, I'm really familiar with American troops. There used to be some troubles caused by them, but recently the number of troubles decreases due to a strict regulation. American Army bases are parts of an important elements in term of a diplomacy between America and Japan, so both of them should get along with."
7416,"I don't agree with Abe's opinion because nuclear power is not reliable in the point of its safty.However,it is true that burning a lot of coal and gas is not good for environment.Therefore,we should use renewable energy like geothermal even if it costs higher than other ways."
7417,"I agree with your opinion.In Japan,talking about homosexuality is considered as taboo. This is not good situation for same-sex couples.We should think about homosexuality and be more acceptable about it."
7418,Nuclear is attractive I know.It has big power to make electricity. And also it is reasonable.But I think we must not use nuclear power. Because it has serious risk.For instance we don't know how to waste spent nuclear waste.It's dangerous which we use nuclear not to understand it. So I hope Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has second thoughts about how to make electricity power.I don't want to turn the nuclear plants back on.
7419,This article said that Japan has problems of energy. This problem is very important for our future. We need amount of energy. We have to consider energy problems.
7420,"Yuichiro Miura conquered Everest twice at that age is really extraordinary record, which is respected by people all over the world. He's mental encouraged me to challenge the things I might never made it. People should live like him!"
7421,"Japan is one of the countries that most rely on the nuclear power in that Japan isn't wealth with the natural resources. But still now, there is no substitute power to change the current situation. In the long run, Japan should exploit the power like geothermal power to heat the whole country, which is good for both environmental factors and economic aspects."
7422,"I agree with a part of your opinion. Actually Japan needs to strongly denounce the behaviors of North Korea, but it isn't enough to solve the problem. The most effective way to solve this problem must be the whole world to raise a mutual sanction to them."
7424,I agree with you. I think there is a way to coexist the springing and homoeroticism' happiness is to promote the use of sperm bank to the people who want to have babies!
7425,"I quite agree with you, Japan's most typical letter likes Nengajyou needs to made by hand-writing but not to print out!"
7426,I agree with your opinion in that I also reckon the reason Sony's languishing steps is due to their unchanged management and administration.
7427,"I think you really pointed out the core problem that the Abe won the election because of there is no other choice for Japanese! And still today, Abe is playing the performance to people and hold on the politic power in the ridiculous situation of many people is opposing him."
7428,"I think we should promote the renewable energy development to replace nuclear energy. It is because nuclear power generation is very dangerous. On 2011,March 11 Fukushima disaster caused a lot of damage which is very difficult and take very long time to cure.So never to happen again, renewable energy is very important."
7429,I am impressed by your opinion. I thought nuclear generation should be only stopped. However you pointed out economic view point. So we have to ponder this problem in many ways.
7430,"It is surely that nuclear power is effective to output energy. But I don't agree with the idea to use nuclear power. It is so danger for Japan to use it. When an earthquake has happened in 2011,the damage by nuclear power was big. If a great earthquake happens again,Damage by nuclear power would be big. I don't want my family, friends and myself to suffer the damage. So I think it is good to use renewable emerge."
7431,"I don't agree with Shinzo Abe's opinion , 'turn the nuclear plants back on.' It is true that the amount of green house gases the nuclear plants emit is less than that of thermal plants.But, nuclear energy is very dangerous.Also, Japan has many earthquakes. We must not forget the Fukushima disaster. Japan should not depend on nuclear energy. Moreover , we don't have the way to cope with nuclear waste completely. All we have to do is find renewable revolution and promote it."
7432,"I agree with your opinion. I think Yuichiro Miura is one of the greatest person in Japan, too. His belief should be respected. It is difficult to continue my efforts, but I want to be the person who never give up whatever happen like him."
7433,"I think this is one of the most important problem for Japanese. We have to think which way we should choose to make our electricity now. Surely,nuclear power is attractive for us. It is because nuclear can make big electricity without discharging toxic gas. And also many developed country use this reasonable way. But,definitive difference between the other countries and Japan is the number of earthquakes. We live in the country with many earthquakes. Nuclear power plant are weak at this. So we have to consider the way that matches the geographical conditions for us. It is not nuclear but other way.So I disagree with Shinzo Abe."
7434,I agree with you. His challenge encourage all of us.We have to try more and more and not to be defeated.
7435,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is terrible that worthy wall paintings are damaged and they need to be fixed as soon as possible,too. I cannot believe why he did that things. Anyway, I hope no one will do that things."
7436,"I think nuclear power plant is dangerous. Though prime minister Abe says that they are under control, it is not the case. Nuclear power plants are too dangerous to create energy. Moreover if our country is attacked by other countries, nuclear power plants will be attacked first. They pollute not only the air, but also the land. We must stop the nuclear power plants !"
7437,"I agree with the opinion that Japan should promote to use renewable energy. We found how dangerous nuclear energy is , after the Fukushima disaster. The problem of the nuclear energy is , I think , nuclear waste. And when it comes to burning coal or gas , the emission of CO2 would increase . Though renewable energy efficiency is not so good compared with fuel . But I think we must protect the environment by taking eco-friendly measures because we human have done the earth harm for a long time."
7438,"I agree with your comments. I think if self-drive cars are used practically, many people especially people of advanced years will live their life more comfortable and traffic accidents will decrease. You concern about the problem that people who drive without license will increase. However I think that we will not need to get a car license in the future."
7439,"I think that Japan should use renewable energy immediately instead of nuclear power and coal and petroleum.Firstly, nuclear power is dangerous. Like the accident in Fukushima, nuclear can expose a lot of people to poisonous radiation and they will be more likely to die of cancer in the future. Moreover, if there are some accidents in nuclear plants, people around them have to escape. Secondly, coal and petroleum have a bad influence on the environment. The increase in CO2 by burning them is a serious problem around the world. CO2 makes the temperature go up and the ocean level rise. If this situation continues, we would not be able to live in the earth someday. Thus, we should use renewable energy which is safe and environmentally friendly, and this change should be took place around the world, especially in China and in the U.S."
7440,"I think Japan should use renewable energy and should not rely on nuclear power. I learned nuclear power is very dangerous through Fukushima disaster, but nuclear power can produce huge amount of electric power and it is cheap. On the other hand, renewable energy needs vast site and it can destroy forests and ecosystem. It is expensive, too. I think from such reason, Japan prefers nuclear power to renewable energy. However, when we think about the risk of nuclear power and the victims by Fukushima disaster, we should not repeat nuclear power's tragedy. In fact, when Fukushima disaster happened, Japan cannot secure electric power and many people lived inconveniently without electricity for a long time, so we have to have alternative energy. It is impossible to produce electric power completely by renewable energy, but we should make the most of nature's power because Japan has a lots of potential ways to generate renewable energy."
7441,"In my opinion, it cannot be avoided that Japan uses nuclear power now. You might think Japan should use renewable energy and should not rely on nuclear power because of its danger. But Japan haven't prepare laws and systems for renewable energy. If Japan keeps stopping nuclear power plant under this situation, we will have trouble from lack of power. So, I think we should use nuclear power until we can use renewable energy efficiently."
7442,"Reading your comment, I sympathize with you about problems of nuclear power and coal and petroleum. But now Japan supply almost power by using them, so we should prepare laws and systems for renewable energy rapidly such as subsidy."
7443,"I think Japan should develop renewable energy industry. There are a lot of natural resources to generate renewable energy in Japan. We had better make the most effective use them . Certainly nuclear power has many advantages,but it is risky to use. But immediate change has a lot of trouble with technological weakness and so on. So,I believe it is important to balance between renewable energy and nuclear power for the time being."
7444,"It is a very difficult problem to solve. To be sure, we can avoid emitting a lot of carbon dioxide cheaply by exploiting nuclear power. However, it has a very fearful possibility that it may emit a lot of harmful substances. Even though we must spend a lot of money, Japanese government should help the development of renewable energy and adopt them for making electricity."
7445,I was surprised to read the article. I think nuclear energy is more dangerous than other energies such as solar and wind energy when something happens. Surely nuclear plants are important. So we will have think about energy problems.
7446,"I think that problem about energy and environment are important problem for us. Nuclear energy produces vast energy, but there is the risk that the accident such as the nuclear power plant of Fukushima happens. We must think about the risk of the nuclear power generation more."
7447,"I agree with your opinion. In Japan we do not have particular religion, so we do not have enough chance to think about taboos. However, when we look at the world, there are many religion and taboos. I think we have to learn other countries' culture in order to live in peace."
7448,"I think we should compare the danger by using the nuclear energy to the danger by the greenhouse gas emission. When there is the accident of the nuclear power plant such as 3/11, a person who there was near may be dead by nuclear radiation, and neighboring nature may be destroyed, too. On the other hand, the whole earth will be in the crisis of the warming when greenhouse gas is emitted.If sea level rises by warming, and there is a person losing a place to live, in a sense it may be 'death', too. In both two cases, someone suffers and dies.I can't determine which life is important and l think everyone should not judge. I just think we do not need a large quantity of electricity too much to have us."
7449,"In my opinion, Japan should use renewable energy such as geothermal undeniably instead of using nuclear energy which is dangerous to the whole world. All of us have known the danger of nuclear energy through the two big tragedy happened in Russia and Japan. They made huge amount of victims and we are all be noticed by the two disasters that we will never use nuclear energy. Now the most essential things Japan should do is making the geothermal be more efficiently or finding some new renewable energy soon. However, this two solution to the problem need a period of time. So I think maybe Japan can put more founding on the research of renewable energy to increase the speed of it. In addition, I suppose Japan might be able to buy electricity from other countries."
7450,"I have experienced the disaster and lived the day saving electricity. To be honest, I thought that we don't need to use so much lights because people around me and I didn't felt uncomfortable. In addition, following to the fact about the solar capacity, I realized that we can develop faster if we are out of necessity. Thus, I thought Japan should keep trying to generate renewable energy."
7451,"We should not use nuclear power. There are two reasons for this. First,using nuclear power can cause various problems. For example,the big earthquake in Fukushima 2011 brought great damage to Japan. Second,there are a lot of potential ways to generate renewable energy in Japan as this article shows. Certainly,generating renewable energy costs a lot of money. But,renewable energy is more eco-friendly than nuclear power. Therefore,we should develop renewable energy."
7452,"We should use nuclear power. There is one main reason that i feel this way. In Japan, especially Tokyo, people use electricity ,however most people do not care about how the electricity generate. People who do not know Japan's electricity rely on nuclear power plant say nuclear plant has to stop because it is dangerous. However, if people do not use nuclear power, what replaces it?? There are a lot of way to generate the electricity using wind ,sun and geothermal, but because of Japan's weather and geography, not so much energy can generate. It means if we want convenient life with electricity, we need nuclear power plant."
7453,"We should not turn the nuclear reactor back on.We should use the renewable energies.Nuclear power may be cheap,but it is dangerous.We learned from Fukushima disaster that nuclear reactor makes our lives exposed to danger.There is nothing more important than the safety of the lives of people."
7454,"I think it is very difficult problem. Nuclear power is dangerous, thermal power releases lots of greenhouse gas and renewable energy is not practical. So government thinks seriously about future energy and should find more safety and more earth-friendly way."
7455,"I think Japan should not use nuclear power because it is risky. Though it is apparently cheaper, the power needs a lot of money to pay people and town. In addition, when dispose nuclear wastes, it also needs a lot of subsidy. In short, it costs a lot. These are reasons why I disagree with nuclear power."
7456,"I was also surprised. I assumed nuclear power was little used. The accident was shocking and horrible, but it was also good timing for people to let us know how nuclear power was risky."
7458,"Although this event wasn't a very serious accident by the failure, it shocked the whole world. I think North Korea really launched the rocket in order to show the threat to people around the world and get the predominance. However, in order to be a strong country, it is necessary to cooperate with other countries. Therefore, the government of North Korea should stop isolating itself and make a good relationship with a lot of countries."
7459,The accident at Fukushima nuclear power generation plant was very terrible.I think that we must not cause a tragedy like this. renewable energy has infinite possibilities.Japanese government should aid research and development of renewable energy for the future in Japan.
7460,"After I read this article, I felt that we do need to think more about our renewable energy. I know nuclear power is the cheapest, but one disaster may take everything away from us like the Fukushima case. I think there is something more important than cost or economic policy. even though Japan stopped all nuclear power plants, government reactivated them again recently and they continue activating despite of Kumamoto earthquake. It would be too late after a major accident happens. Sure it is difficult to find sustainable renewable energy, but we need to continue thinking about them. If we do our best, in the end we can find the right alternatives."
7461,"I think, nuclear power is necessary for Japan now, but Japan should desterilize renewable energies. Nuclear plants have a serious disadvantage for the country of earthquake-prone, Japan: they are vulnerable from disasters. So, it is necessary for them to keep under human's close observation. However, if the observer don't know the nuclear disaster like Fukushima or Chernobyl, they have little understanding for disasters and possibilities of happening it increase. Thinking from the viewpoint of protecting People and Country, Japanese government should push ahead with using renewable that is reliable and high safety."
7462,I agree with you. Japanese government should take some actions to develop renewable energy.
7463,"It is a complex problem. Actually if we use nuclear power, we may grow the economy. But if it is true that nuclear power is cheap and reliable, we should not use that dangerous power at least on the quake-prone island, I think. If we quit nuclear power, we probably release a lot of CO2. And perhaps that will promote warming. However, we can not expect an invention which neutralize radioactivity, and we can expect inventions which decrease CO2 or which build renewable energy's plants. That is why warming is better than almost permanent radioactive contamination, although both energies destroy our planet."
7464,"I'm against for the plan to return to nuclear power . Because Japan has experienced serious accident at Fukushima and has a high probability of recurrence . Unfortunately there are a lot of volcanoes and Active faults that cause earthquakes . I think it's not suitable for Japan to make electricity by using nuclear generator . However , it was mentioned in article , Japan has a big advantage in a field about renewable energy especially geothermal . Japanese people like 'Discount' , 'Limited sale' etc, very much . Japanese government should own the land for geothermal power generation and lease a section of that and make a system that the government gives preferential treatment to owners . In this way, I think the government should change a current policy to new one that is suitable for Japan ."
7465,I think so too. I think that people must try to find the new energy instead of fuel.
7466,I agree with you. I haven't thought about the danger of nuclear much. We should think more.
7467,"I agree with you. We should not use nuclear power plants. Though renewable energy costs a lot of money, it is more eco-friendly than nuclear energy. We must do away with nuclear power plants!"
7468,"It is difficult problem in that balance of economy,safe and ecology. Thermal power generation is popular in Japan but it is but for ecology and economy.Nuclear power generation is clean energy but it has danger of radiation.Renewable energy is very good for environment but it doesn't cover majority of electronic power. I think we need nuclear power now ,but we should reduce thermal power and promote to spread renewable energy. In the long run, this way is good for us and the earth."
7469,"I think this is one of the most difficult problem for Japanese. Nuclear power is attractive for us. It is because nuclear can make big electricity without discharging toxic gas. But I think shouldn't we use nuclear power,because this action break down the environment.And very dangerous for Japan,and earth.So I disagree prime minister Shinzo Abe.we should protect our country and our planet earth."
7470,"I agree with you.It's very difficult problem and nuclear power is very dangerous.I hope safety and more earth-friendly way,too."
7471,"I agree with you. Today, information technology is developing and world economy is changing dramatically day by day because of globalization. Japanese companies should have stick to stereotype. They should be flexible to adapt the world circumstance. I want Japanese companies ,such as Sony, to compete in world economy."
7472,"After the Fukushima disaster, Japan's nuclear reactors were shut down. Nuclear is very dangerous. However, it generates a lot of electricity and it's effective. So, Japan should not depend on nuclear power too much. And should find new ways to use nuclear power safely."
7473,"Japanese government is promoting to turn the nuclear plants back on. However, after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, Japan kept running well without nuclear plants. Moreover, in Japan, there are many ways to produce energy without nuclear plants like using geothermal sources, solar energy or hydropower. On the other hand, there is so huge risk by using nuclear plants again. If nuclear plants explode, it is said that total amount of damage will be billion yen. Therefore, I think that Japan should not turn the nuclear plants back on."
7474,"I agree with you. If elderly people continue to increase and younger people continue to decrease as it is expected, Japanese economy will become weaker and weaker. Japan has to think and perform some counter-plans in order to solve this problem. I suggest two counter-plans for this. At first, Japan has to increase the number of nursery schools. Japan has to prepare the ideal environment to raise kids in. Secondary, Japan has to adopt two children policy. Japan has to increase its population by this. It is important to increase the number of younger people."
7475,"I think Japan should stop nuclear power generation. But in terms of cost, efficiency, and the amount of emission, there are many problems about renewable energy. Though Abe may have had no choice but to turn the nuclear plants back on, all nuclear plants operating now should be shut down as soon as technology is developed."
7477,I think so too. We cannot rely on social security .And we have to let elderly people work longer.
7478,I agree with the idea. I think the disparity will go on widening in the world.
7479,"Nowadays, we have serious issues of energy. Before the Fukushima Disaster, I believe the stability of energy supply and safety of nuclear generation. Nuclear energy is huge and clean, so we have to consider how to keep safe the generation. We should make up for energy with other renewable energy resources by development of safety nuclear energy."
7480,"I agree with your opinion. I think Japan should use renewable energy in the future, but had better use nuclear power now. If Japan stops using nuclear power now, we can't live usually because of imperfection of renewable energy. So,we should consider."
7481,"At first, when we think this problem, it is important what you make much of. My idea is simple. We should select which is more important thing when we compare the effective use of the money with the risk of the life. I think making many people's life safe is more important. because I know hidden property of the government called the national maintenance cost among us. So, this problem is settled immediately if the government use it for the reconstruction of the power supply method. I hope Japan become a great nation which uses the money spent for no purpose for the Emperor and a politician voluntarily."
7483,I admire your point of view of Japan's geography. I also think that it is important for the government to understand the geographical conditions when planning energy policies.
7484,I agree with your opinion. We thought that it is necessary to consider how to balance between the renewable energy and nuclear power.
7485,"I agree with your opinion. It is dangerous to rely on nuclear power. Nuclear energy can expose a lot of people to poisonous radiation. Japanese government should decide immediately what energy it will use. Moreover, at the same time, the government should consider whether its energy is really safe."
7486,"I agree that 'it seems to emphasize that same-sex couples are abnormal.' However, I don't hit on another good method. How do you claim that we should not discriminate if it is you?"
7487,I think energy problem in Japan is very difficult issue. Japan is island nation .And Japan has a lot of mountains. Then Japan's land development is so difficult. So Japan leaned on nuclear power. But nuclear power is very dangerous. So we have to search safety energy.
7488,"I agree with this comment. Elderly people are increasing but children are decreasing in Japan. It means supporting the retired elderly people is too heavy burden for young generations. Therefore, it is good idea to give a job to retired people and it will make the economy better . We have to think this problem from now."
7489,"I agree with it. There is human right to get married with the same sex people . The couples who love each other choose marriage, it is good, however the children do not choose the parents. They are hard to admit their same sex parents, therefore i think it is not good idea for same sex couples to adopt their children."
7490,"I agree with this comment. We have less opportunity to write Kanji these days and it makes us to forget writhing skills. Writing Kanji is one of the biggest identity for Japanese people i think. When I went to summer school in England, many friends around the world ask me to write Kanji. They are interested in Japanese writings and they said it was so cool. We should be proud of the Kanji culture and we have never forgot it ."
7491,I believe same way as this comment. People have to have dreams whenever you are. My grandfather has dream even though he is 87. He is always challenging himself. He helps his son with his company.
7492,"I think the time has come for us to consider energy problems in Japan.Japan has depended on fossil fuels or nuclear energy,but it is obvious that the former is not sustainable and the latter is too dangerous if there are accidents or terrorists' attacks.This is because we have to shift these energy to sustainable and safe energy.However,our discussion on energy problems is very unsatisfactory.So at the beginning we should discus them seriously."
7493,"I agree with you. The damage that nuclear plant bring to us in times of emergency, is very serious and can change everything of us only one time.Thinking about my family and friends, I don't want to lose them by nuclear accident. I hope Japanese government walk on safe way."
7494,"I think this article is a little biased because it doesn't consider enough Japan's economy. Indeed following Fukushima disaster predicted blackouts did not happen, using a lot of coals and gas to make electricity cost too much. I think Japanese government should use nuclear power until researchers find energy which is renewable, and also not too expensive."
7495,"I agree with you. Finding a better way is necessary for Japanese government, and the governments all over the world. It, however, costs much and needs specific technical experts, so every country should cooperate each other."
7496,"I cannot get your point of 'It is to increase driving without a license.' because with the automatic cars why do we still need license for driving a car? On the other hand, I think it could be a proper opportunity to decrease the traffic accident."
7497,"Your opinion is quite interesting. However, I reckon the value of the highly complete artworks deserve such a high payment."
7498,I think your opinion is wonderful. It's quite a important territory strategic for both Japan and USA.
7499,Understand their thought might not enough to solve the problem. What we need to do is to provide educational and mental assistance for them to solve the essential issues of their thought.
7500,"I think we don't have to worry about the problem of energy. An ideal energy would be safe, low price, stable, and clean. But every energy has faults. Therefore, we should use many kind of energies to cover other's faults. Now Japan is doing so, so I don't think it is risky. In addition, clean energy will be cheaper because of increasing the popularity of user. Technology will also improve because same reason, I think."
7501,I think your opinion is quite practical. All strategy and method needs financial support for enablement.
7502,"I am all for your opinion. Whether there is a perfect way to save everyone, we always need to think save all of them all the time! Choosing only one of them is really the last way."
7503,I think your opinion is quite objective. It's true that EU is too young to award the prize. Also there are a lot of internal problems is in the waiting list to let them solve.
7504,"I disagree with Shinzo Abe's opinion. Of course, if Japanese government reopens nuclear power generation, our life will become rich. However, it is very dangerous because many disasters occur in Japan such as earthquake, eruption, and typhoon. As a result, Japan will suffer big damage. Therefore, I think that Japanese government must think carefully about it."
7505,I agree with your opinion. The damage of nuclear energy will remain for long time. We should care its safety.
7506,I was very surprised when I heard the news of the accident at Fukushima. I felt it like the nuclear bomb. I think it is important to do away with all the nuclear plants to save many lives and to develop new ways of generating electricity. I hope the day will come as soon as possible when we can live safely.
7507,"I was surprised to read this article of the news. In my opinion,I think we shouldn't use unclear power. Because, I am afraid of unclear power since the Fukushima disaster. When I watched Fukushima disaster though TV , I was very scared . So I think we should use renewable energy."
7508,"I agree with your opinion that disagreeing with Trump's plan to ban Muslim immigrations. But we couldn't look over the situation that many American people agree with Trump's idea, that is to say, they are disgusted with crimes by Muslims and scared with terrorism. So, I think we shouldn't expel all of Muslim immigrations from our country, and we should accept immigrations partly. For example, the government select immigrations by their skills."
7509,"I quite agree with you. It is amazing he accomplished reaching the top of the highest mountain in the world. Like him, I want to try something which is difficult, but worth trying. For example, I would like to travel around the world by myself. This might be troublesome.but at the same time, I will be able to get a sense of achievement."
7510,"I agree with you in that people should promote more actions to solve the gender problems. They should consider the equality of gender. These traffic lights are effective and for example,putting advertisement on walls in the station will be also meaningful."
7511,I agree with you. I think that big inequality of wealth among people in Brazil is the main cause of this accidents too.Olympic will be held in Brazil this year.So I hope Brazil will be the country which we can be relieved to visit.
7512,I agree with you. I have heard this news. But I cannot decide whether he is right or not.It's important for us to think about privacy rights.
7513,Your comments is great! I disagree with Mr. Trump's thought.His statement is not like American. i believe nothing comes out of anger or hate.
7514,"I am very excited with it too.It's revolutionary thing! If this technology comes true, driving will be more safety and more people will try to drive.I'm looking forward to this technology comes true."
7515,"I agree with your opinion. There are many people who are suffering with a gender identify. So, I also think this idea is wonderful, and everyone had accept those people."
7516,"I think ''When in Rome,do as Romans do.' is a nice idea. People should respect other senses of value. There are a lot of people who have various value in the world. We should accept different value each other."
7517,"I almost agree with your opinion. Almost all immigrants are good and victims of ISIS's attacks. However, there is a possibility that there are terrorists in immigrants. Certainly,Trump's plan is overrun but we should notice the risk of terror. We must continue considering the solution of this problem."
7520,"I agree with your opinion. To replace nuclear power with renewable resources is not so easy, so we should know the problem nuclear plants or renewable energy faces and think about how we deal with the plants. It's too difficult to resolve, but nuclear power may break our lives, so we should take interest in this problem."
7521,"I agree with you. As time passes, decreasing CO2 become ever more important. Japan has many useful environmental condition and advanced techniques to generate clean energy. We have learned nuclear is dangerous tool for our country. I hope Japan to be a low-carbon-footprint country."
7523,"I agree this opinion. Now, Japanese government has PAC3 which destroys missile,because North Korea grows economy,technology and military affairs. I hope that we never don't use it."
7524,"I really agree with this opinion. We use smart phone and any other electronics, so I forget some Kanji likes many Japanese people. In my opinion, we should more promote 'Kanken' and reading books which has some Kanji and 'Kotowaza', and more love it."
7526,"I agree with her opinion in that 'prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics'.Now EU has some serious Problems such Greece financial crisis , England elects whatever they withdraw EU. I'm worry about EU which will divide or disperse."
7529,"When I read this article , I felt sad and angry. I cannot understand why Kyozo Isohi killed two people so that he would be sentenced to death. In my opinion, if the suspect really wanted to die, as Matsui Ichiro said in the article, he should have killed himself."
7530,I agree with your opinion. Thinking about new energy is very difficult and important. Also renewable energy has many problems. But you described exactly about it. So you should continue to think about it.
7531,"I agree your opinion. I think we are obligated to live out our natural lives, because there are many dead people who even though wanted to live longer."
7534,I agree with you. We have to learn the rules of foreign countries before going there.
7535,I agree with you. I hope Japan will accept the marriage of same-sex couples as some countries do.
7537,I agree your opinion. I think it is difficult for Japanese to understand the other culture and religion.Therefore it is very important to try to recognize them.
7539,I agree with you. I suppose we write diaries every day because of remembering Kanji and preventing dementia.
7540,"I was also surprised to read this article. I did not know there were strict religious rules like this. In japan, we are comparatively free to decide what and how we believe in, so, for a lot of people this fact would be unbelievable. As you say, we should be careful not to break religious rules when going abroad."
7541,"I agree with you in that each people should believe in each religion freely. If this idea can be understood by people around the world, many disputes related to religion such as the one between India and Sri Lanka will be resolved."
7542,You idea is so realistic. The Japanese government would be able to carry out this plan after the government consider carefully what kind of renewable energy we use and for what we utilise it.
7543,"I agree with your opinion. His action was too rash to participate in politics. It was not right democracy,I think. When we vote in an election, we must not judge by candidate's appearances. So, we should consider about the policy."
7545,"I agree with you.There are many trouble in Okinawa because of American troop.For example, noise of fighter plane and a case of a murder are serious matters. I also think we should share the burden of Okinawa. So, Japanese government should grope for a solution."
7546,I didn't know Sri Lanka is that sensitive about image go the Buddha too. I realize the difference of manners and customs between countries. I agree with your thought.
7547,I agree with you. Japan does not have much source of energy.So we should find the way to change something into energy.And the way should be safety for the environment.
7548,"I think so . But, we should not think to use renewable power but also think to reduce."
7549,I agree with you . Abe seems only economics. So he should think about Japanese future.
7550,I think so. But we also should think about the way to independent from electricity.
7551,I agree with you. I think that he taught us the importance of keeping to try.
7552,I think so. I think he proved that the age isn't related to challenge.
7553,I think so. His soul encouraged to me .And I want to be like him when I am more older.
7554,I used to play rugby.And I experienced many injuries and bitterness.So I respect his challenge spirit.
7555,I agree with you . we should make an effort to understand the transgender.Because People who includes transgender have human rights.
7556,"I was also surprised that in Australia , people have understanding for transgender.we should think how to get understanding for transgender in Japan."
7557,"I agree with you. In Japanese constitution,the liberty of marriage is alowed.So,Gays should be allowed."
7558,"I don't agree with you. In these days, tattoo is considered as fassion.So we make an effort to understand ."
7559,I think so. It is important to research for the country that we go.
7560,"I agree with you. In Japan,we don't feel that religious mind is very strong.But In abroad , people live a life that is based on religion."
7561,I agree with you. We have to find another renewable energy because Japan has few source of energy. And I think it is necessary to save of electricity.
7562,"I don't agree with you. Certainly, it is good if this kind of money is used for constructive things. But the way to use money depends on the thought of people who money."
7563,"I almost agree with you. Those driver and so on will not be able to work in the future.However, new kind of job will be born. For example, self-driving vehicle's mechanic is important and indispensable, I think. So, they can work in a new job."
7564,"I hadn't known the real situation of immigrants in Japan, too. Japanese have to notice the present of them. Some of them may be terrorists, but most of them are good people. So,Japanese must not treat immigrants like criminals,I also think."
7566,I agree with you. I think same-sex marriage should be admitted.
7568,I agree with you.Nuclear power has a lot of risks. I think that we should think about how to reduce costs of generating renewable power.
7569,I agree with you.It is wonderful to keep trying something until you are 80years old.
7570,"I was surprised at this article, too. But, I don't think that they are not proud of their own flag. It means that they just want to forget their shady past. However, I also think Japanese flag is good. We should treat our national flag as important thing."
7571,"I agree with you. I was very surprised at this article. I think politicians should take the responsibility for the job that they did. But we also have responsibility for electing them, I think."
7572,I agree with you. National flag has important meanings. I think it is important to know its meanings.
7573,"I agree with you. I was very shocked at this article. The latest scandals made Japanese people angry. The politicians should take the responsibility for the job that they did. And they should apologize not for their behavior but for their carelessness. The politicians should work hard for the future. But we also have responsibility for electing them. We will vote an Upper House election soon, so we should choose candidate carefully."
7574,"I agree with your opinion. I also think the national flag explains our thought, history and our humanity, and represents the nation so much. For example, there are a lot of tradition and history of Japanese in our nation flag in Japan. Therefore, it is not so easy to change a national flag and we do not need to change our flag."
7575,"I agree with you. It is difficult to judge whether death penalty is need or not. But there is possibility of a false charge. So, we should abolish death penalty, I think."
7576,"I agree with you. Washoku has a lot of merits such as low calorie and healthy,so I like washoku,too. We should expand its attractions into all over the world and hand this tradition to the next generation, I think."
7577,"I am using the Facebook, but did not know this news. I did not think undesirable pictures of plus size models. I think that way of feeling by the people to see the advert is different. Therefore, crackdown of advertising thought it was difficult."
7579,"I agree with you so much. Although I'm a Chinese but I really love Japanese food Washoku. It tastes mild and good to our health. What's more, It's a kind of culture of Japan. We should keep it without loosing someday."
7580,"I agree with your opinion. I also think Mandela is one of the greatest person. There are many problem in South Africa, so, the people who live in there should not disregard it."
7581,I agree with you. i think it's too expensive to pay. So we should pay attention to them.
7583,"I agree with you. I respect her and think she was great person. If I were her, I wouldn't keep running."
7584,I agree with you. I think Nelson Mandela is a great person. I hope we'll live freely without the discrimination.
7585,I suppose I won't keep running as her too. I really respect her because it's a hard work which needs enough encourage and strong impatience. i hope I can become a person like her someday.
7586,"I agree with your idea that Sony slipped back because its unchanged management and asministration.And an innovation company should put its eye in front of the time, It should read the customers' needs in some years after now."
7587,"Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest people in the world I think. I have read the story about him when I was a junior high student. Although he died, his spirits will still leave in our mind. We should keep the freedom and equality."
7588,I totally agree with you. Life is the most precious thing in the world. The value won't be change by age or something other. It is meaningless to make a law like this. I can say it's ridiculous.
7589,"The current capitalism's reputation slipped down. The phenomenon is apparently tell us the reason of it. Japan has a serious problem in national debt, so the first work to Japan is absolutely to make economy turn better. And then we can take our hands on solving the environment problem."
7590,As a candidate for the mayor in Odessa should has a recognize of responsibility. You can take jokes to show your individuality in any time but the work time. Because you have the responsibility to your voter and all of the citizen.
7591,"I agree with you in that people should be free to decide who they marry. It would be true that the number of people will decrease in the future. This will cause the lack of manpower and will impede the economic progress.However, the right to marry someone they love is more important. People should be treated equally. I hope marriage of same-sex couples will be accepted widely around the world."
7592,I agree with you. North Korea's missile has big threat and danger. So we should argue and persuade them not to do that things.
7593,I agree with you. We should think the serious problem. And we should think the solution of the problem till we become that age.
7594,"I agree with you. Recently,we usually use phone or computers when we write. It's also important for us to hand-write."
7595,I agree with you. I don't know why did that things. I hope it won't be happened in the future.
7597,"I agree with your opinion. In fact, I had not known about the news and I didn't know the real situation of Tunisia. When I read this article, I felt Nobel Peace Prize isn't a true award for peace. This is because, in Tunisia and some other countries, there is much terrorism, and the situation of these countries' economy is bad. I think getting rid of a gap between citizens and their government would make the present conditions better. Both factions need to make concessions. Also, we should think over the awarding system of Nobel Prize. I learn that we should see the event from one aspect and it is important to pay attention to not only winner of the Noble Peace Prize but also giver of that."
7598,"I agree with your opinion. Especially, the opinion that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions is good idea. If the destruction of the environment goes on, it influences the lives of next generations, that is to say, our descendants. Therefore, we should discuss a lack of awareness on the part of the persons concerned about environmental issues. I think everyone can do something for reducing CO2 emissions with a conscious effort. And after reading the article, I was surprised to know China has been using resources effectively and other country such as Germany and the UK has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. So the Japanese government should begin doing action for the decrease of CO2 emissions as a member of the world community. But in the world, each country's policy didn't remain be in disagreement. The developing countries want to keep using fossil fuels because the developed countries made their power big by the same way until now. On the other hand, the developed countries want the developing countries not to use fossil fuels from point of ecological views. I accept both opinions. But maybe I think that the developed countries only want the developing countries not to have more power. So this problem is exceedingly difficult."
7599,I agree with you. I can't understand his thought like killing people at random. I hope nobody kills people including yourself.
7600,I agree with you. I think she didn't need to kill herself while his actions.
7601,"I agree with your opinion. Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move away the American bases from Okinawa. I think he American bases burden people who live in Okinawa. We should take away heavy burden of Okinawa, but US troops are necessary and important for Japan. At the same time, Okinawa is important place strategically for America. Especially, advance of China prove a great menace of Japan. So the American bases are important in diplomatic relationship for both countries. It's difficult problem to solve whether American troops to stay in Okinawa or to move away from Okinawa. Therefore we should discuss this problem carefully."
7602,"I agree with your opinion. I was surprised with this article when I read it for the first time. In my opinion, candidates have to change their clothes which are appropriate to the occasion. This is because the clothes have the way which represent the situation one person is included. For example, we will not able to respect the person who wears a black tie in the wedding. If we are in the party of wedding, we have to wear white tie, though it is definitely different from the custom. The people who have stable sensation gives people good impression. As the same thing, candidates should wear their clothes which are appropriate to the occasion, too. Candidates who ran playfully will give a bad effect on democracy. As a candidate for the mayor he should has a recognize of responsibility."
7603,"I disagree with your opinion that we don't have to give him death penalty because we should apply the regulations to any case. Also, there are many complex feeling of families and friends of the victims. But I think so too for this case is difficult judgement."
7604,"I agree with your opinion that the reason of China's Ministry of Justice lacks for persuasiveness. I think this kind of question doesn't have genuine correct answer. These questions are based on each person's thought. So, it is unusual that country is involved in self-decision in that situation."
7605,I agree with your opinion. It is good to everyone has his or her freedom to choose happiness. But I never thought the possibility that it may take lots of money. I hope the government put priority on these policies.
7606,"I agree with your opinion. These days many celebrities wear tattoos, so is considered as fashion. And in Japan, we do not have particular religion. However, in the world, there are many religion and way of thinking. I think we have to learn other countries' culture in order to live in peace. And we should make more effort to understand each other."
7607,"I agree with your opinion that same-sex couples should be able to marry. All people should be free to decide who they marry. It is said that granting same-sex marriage leads to a declining number of children, but there are not solid proof."
7608,"I partly agree with your opinion. Terrorism is terrible, and many people around the world were killed by terrorist. However, we must not discriminate by religion. The discrimination should cause the conflict between Muslim and the others. It is what IS want. So, Trump's thought is very careless and luck of knowledge."
7613,"I think so,too. We need to develop the renewable energy."
7614,"I agree with you that we cannot manage any environmental problem without money. Japan's debt is great. So, Japan government is bound by it and can't carry out bold policy. Now, House of councilors election is going. I'm 18 years old. I will pay attention to economic policy."
7619,"As you say, I also hope the bionic suits will help people having handicaps spend days without difficulties. Moreover, it is important for us to understand them and cooperate with each other. If this is accomplished, handicapped people will be able to live more happily."
7620,"Mr.Trump won primary election of American president. He doesn't change a tougher stance for Muslims and terrorism. His policy is very conservative so he is criticised, but he is still supported some people, because a lot of American feel like Trump. I think so and agree with 'we must keep in mind that all Muslim are not radicals. I suppose such proposal is inconsistent the separation of church and state. And, this plan may lead to causing new acts of terrorism or religious conflicts'."
7621,"I really agree with your opinion. She accomplished the amazing thing, which would have impressed a lot of people. Of course, her efforts enabled her to complete a full marathon, but this achievement is not just because of the efforts. The support of her family had a big influence on her success. Like her, I want to try something which is difficult to accomplish."
7622,"I agree your opinion in that government should regulate using 3D printer to keep safety in future. I read this article, I feel so fear, because terrorists can use weapons so easier. Now, in the world, great number of people afraid terrorism. We should think more serious how to use 3D printer and what we must not to do by using it. I don't want this great technology which is exploited for war."
7623,"It's a serious problem to not only Japan, but also the whole world. We should find out the new high performance renewable source to solve the problem as soon as possible."
7625,"I totally agree with you in this case. To this man, we should use this punishment. But what I want to say this case shows us that there is a serious problem with the system of released criminal. Government should improve it to solve this problem."
7626,"I absolutely agree with you. As the elderly population is growing, we should try to make the work environment suitable to elderly so that work population increase."
7627,I agree with you. We should try to solve the problems.
7629,"I agree with your opinion. North Korea tries to attract other country's attention by violent action, and it is difficult to guess what Kim Jung-Un thinks. So, I think we must think it over carefully as a neighboring country."
7630,"I agree with your opinion. II think Kim Jong Un try to attract other countries' attention and show off his power, as there is rumor that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I worry the action of North Korea that this performance may be escalated. So, I think we must think it over carefully as a neighboring country."
7631,"I don't agree this opinion. Because North Korea is developing now, in that education, technology and military. Pyongyang, at a glance, I can't believe where is dictatorship state. We, so far, North Korea is introvert, tyranny and not modern, but these might be correct. We should change correspondence to North Korea. It is more strong state than we think."
7632,"I agree with you.Like you say, Japan is island nation.So Japan cannot import electricity from other countries.Nuclear power is attractive way to make electricity. But it's very dangerous."
7633,"I agree with you. I think too this question is basically wrong. People's lives are equal, so we cannot decide which life we should save in emergency. Even if he had saved a mother or a girlfriend, he shouldn't have been condemned because it is not appropriate for the official judicial examination."
7634,"I worry the future situation in North Korea too.There is near Japan.If Kim Jong Un develop nuclear disarmament more,the dangerous may reach my country."
7635,"I have read this article too.When I read this, I felt indignation.I want the government do more things to improve women position.So I agree with you so much."
7636,"This is sad news I remember. When I heard this news, I'm high school student.Many people who died by this accident was same with my age. I was shocked.They had brilliant future. And also I disappoint with the captain. He should have responsibility escaped. Why he didn't rescue them. I cannot understand him.If he make the right decision,more student may alive.We should not forget this terrible accident. And make a effort to never occur such as that accident."
7637,I agree with you. I think the government should respect feelings of same-sex couples. There is no reason for opposing to their marriages. They must have the right to be happy like normal people.
7638,"I'm impressed by this article too.I learned many things from Nelson.In his life, he had a lot of trouble. But he didn't give up.He stick to his principle.I want be the person like him."
7639,You say 'you can sleep 7 hours.'I envy you so much!I usually sleep for less than 6 hours.So I always feel sleepy.I often do housework or do my homework at night.But this article tell me sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking.From this I decide to sleep more like you.
7640,I have a same idea with you. Equal treatment to the LGBT has big importance in the world. However many people don't understand the fact what LGBT is and that there are no difference between LGBTs and us at all. This is good idea!
7641,"I totally agree with you. We must continue to try to eliminate discrimination around the world. He has done historically significant thing and a lot of people would have been helped. I believe that we have to do something in order to many people, such as Islamist in Europe, be able to live without the difficulty of segregation."
7642,"I was also shocked to hear this news. Many people today should respect his bravery. I want to be a person who contribute to the development of the world, especially in developing countries, such as Africa."
7644,"I agree with this opinion. Because he leaves us a lot of things.His fight for distinguish changed our stereotypes about race, religion and other some conflicts. I pray that his soul may rest in peace."
7645,"Although I have my account in Facebook, I haven't heard of this news. However, I sometimes see some of my friends pictures (which is NOT filthy ones) are restricted by twitter. I guess they can't tell ordinary ones from filthy ones because there are so many pictures on twitter or Facebook. I think, however, a picture of plus sized model should of course be accepted without any reasonable reason."
7646,"I agree with you. In fact, in Japan, Shibuya certify the gay couple to some extent. However, Japanese government haven't accepted the gay-couple-marriage yet. I hope they will soon be able to get married in Japan."
7647,"Nowadays we still can find double standards in countless aspects, such as the most typical imparity---sex inequality. Article mentioned Facebook rejected a plus-sized model who violated their company's 'ad guidelines'. It quite unbelievable, but at the same time, I realized such happening is what us facing all the time in modern society. Things what people in majority think should not be the standard and disparage the people in minority. We should try to accept diversification in thinking."
7655,"It is difficult to decide what kind of photos should be banned.Today,social networking services like Facebook are public space being looked by many people in all over the world.Therefore,it is not good idea to allow all photos to post without any rules.However,the standards deciding which photos are undesirable to be posted differ from place to place.We should think about differences in cultures."
7657,"Images that depict body part in an undesirable manner should be banned because they can be abused. I think images that are bad for education and incite young people to commit a crime also should be banned. It is difficult to decide what picture should be banned because the standard which picture is undesirable or not is different from culture to culture. However, allowing celebrities to post undesirable picture and banning common people to do that is unfair, so Facebook should make standard that apply to everyone."
7658,I think religious issue should have to think more seriously. There are a lot of religions all over the world. So there are many kinds of people who believe in many kinds of religion. We should have to corporate many things regardless of religion. this issue is big problem for our human.
7659,"I was surprised when I heard this news. I live in Japan since I was born, but I recognize that prior to the Fukushima disaster nearly 30% of power came from nuclear for the first time. This rate is very high for me. Nuclear power generate less green house gasses, but when accident occur, the damage will be serious, so this way to generate electrical is high risk. I think nuclear power should reduce more."
7661,"I agree with you. I respect his thought of keeping challenging his limit. I tend to give up things easily when I face difficulties, but I want to keep challenge and achieve my goal. By reading this article, I become to think that people can achieve their goal if they do not give up, continue thinking about their goal and keep trying."
7662,"I thought Facebook were going too far. There are many people in the world and they have various characters and appearances.So, Facebook should not have banned the photo. The site has a lot of another photos to censor. Certainly, There are some people who think that fat people are not undesirable, but it can be also said about too thin people. Fat people are not wrong and the appearances should be accepted as their individuality. So, we must have tolerance to receive others."
7663,"First I looked this photo,I don't know what it mean.After read the article,I think it's difficult to decide which picture Facebook should ban.If Facebook ban photos in a rigorous way,people will say to violate the right to freedom of expression.But if Facebook doesn't ban any photo,it will disrupt order in the social networking.One thing I can say is it's over the top which Facebook ban photo of a plus-sized model."
7664,"Facebook is only social network service. So, I think Facebook should not make judgement about which photos make viewers feel bad.If viewer feels bad by Facebook's ad, it will be good that such photos initially not to be able to view again in his or her Facebook' ad by Facebook."
7667,I agree with your opinion.And I think we have the right to view all kind of ads by law.
7669,"I agree with you. We should use renewable energy for these aspects, and do you think which way is the best for them?"
7670,"I hope so, too. Do you think suicide is include to kill person?"
7671,I agree with you. Everyone has the right to live by law. I think it means that we have to live until our death.
7672,"I agree with your opinion. I think when we have sense of danger about losing our Kanji's skills, culture of Kanji will not disappear from Japan."
7673,"Although I have Facebook's account,I didn't know this news.I think that the apologize of Facebook was correct.Because people have the liberty of posting photos that they like.But I think that SNS cites should censor photos to protect children.If they won't censor any photos,Facebook will be filled with harmful posting for children like grotesque,obscenity.Therefore I think that Facebook should not censor photos by a shape but a effect that give."
7674,"I think so,too. I think doing everything needs healthy body for us."
7675,"I haven't meet transgender,so I don't understand their feelings.But these days transgender advance into the entertainment world. So we often see them on TV like MatsukoDX,IKKO.And the new law for transgender had passed in Shibuya. I think that this Obama's opinion spread to Japan in 3 years,and the 3years made us try to understand transgender."
7676,"I agree with you. Your insight is very good. Arab Spring shocked the world and greatly changed international relations. I don't think Tunisia's story is only success model of Arab Spring. The countries that democratized in Arab Spring have many problems in politics, economics, public peace, terrorism and so on. Tunisia is just one of them. And, in recent years, the Nobel Prize is utilized for political affairs, like Obama. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded without political reasons and it should seek a new system for real world peace."
7678,"When I heard this news for the first time, I was very shocked. As you know, we have a right which we can express our true feeling, freedom of expression. So no matter what we use plus-sized model, we will not be punished for it. And this problem may develop human rights issue. So this problem should think seriously."
7679,"When I see this article's title, I can't understand the meaning. I didn't know this news. I think Facebook should not have censor the photos of plus-sized model. Her photo is not undesirable. People around the world should have freedom of expressions. Facebook is a worldwide company. So, unless the photo invades someone's privacy or hurt to someone, it should not censored and should protect user's freedom of expressions. However, once a photo appear on the Internet, it can't be deleted. So, the problem in this article is very difficult."
7681,I agree with you. He is great person for people all over the world. Losing him have a major effect for us.
7682,"I agree with you. Kanji is symbol of being good-educated since ancient Japan. So if this problem become more seriously, Japanese good tradition will be lose."
7683,I think so. And I think he is the greatest man in Japan. So His name and challenge is transmitted to posterity.
7684,"I think so. And people should be to cultivate a better understanding of LGBT. If everyone thinks so, everyone feels happy."
7685,"I agree with you. Even now, Japanese population rate of elderly is very high than other country. Therefore, this problem should discuss seriously from now."
7686,I agree with you. Her mind that she never give up is great and honorable. We should target people like her.
7687,"I have my account in Facebook, but I didn't know this news. I think Facebook should have apologized for banning a photo of a plus-sized model. Certainly, some people may think the photo undesirable, but Facebook went too far when it banned it. However, the problem that what kind of photos should censor is difficult."
7688,"This problem is very serious. I propose two solutions. Firstly, to increase labor force, Japan should accept a lot of foreign workers. The world is getting globalizing, and Japanese enterprises expand overseas. So, foreign workers is useful for the business. Secondly, to increase the birth-rate and stop an aging society, Japanese government should increase nursery schools and kindergartens, and raise from the basic wage of its teacher. If it is succeed, the birth-rate will be increased. In this year, 18-year-old franchise is started. Although Japan's population is continuing to age, it is not good that welfare for elderly people is considered the most important thing. We are 18 years old, should go to the poll to make Japan future-oriented country."
7689,"I agree with you. People in Okinawa strongly want American military to leave. Few days ago, in Okinawa, a woman was killed by American workers for the military. So the activity for leaving American military in Okinawa is activated. However, it is important that there is American military in Okinawa for international safety. We can't solute the problem perfectly. Japanese government should continue to seek the best solutions considering people in Okinawa."
7690,"I didn't know this news. i was so surprised because I assumed Facebook was tolerant. But it was a big mistake. I couldn't believe this news first. It is discrimination. We shouldn't approve it. SNS should be equal to us. Certainly I think censoring pictures is good for us, especially kids. But it is not always good."
7695,"I also know some people are restricted by twitter. Both Facebook and twitter restricts us by ways which are not reasonable. We should pay attention to how to use SNS, shouldn't we?"
7696,"I agree with your opinion which says it is very important to respect gender identity disorder as their identity. To get together with other people, I think, we should admit us each other."
7697,"They should not encourage unhealthy diet and should not make people feel bad. However, they also should not restrict the free of expression. It is difficult to judge which is more important. We must keep thinking about these important value and come up with better way to use the Internet."
7698,"I disagree the idea of Mr.Trumpin two point. First, he discriminate people by religion or race. It should not be allowed whatever happens. Second, he often say thing which is not in fact. When we listen to his speech, we assume he say true thing, and we are deceived by him."
7707,"Facebook should treat all the people equally. World has many people. And population is increasing steadily. In this surroundings, it is no surprise that there is a lot of identity. Their assertion is out of step with the times."
7708,"Today, most people use SNS and can see many photos on it. It is difficult to decide which photos should be banned and eliminated from internet because what kind of photo people dislike depends on individuals. For example, in most countries, photos of drinking are accepted. However, in Saudi Arabia, such photos are hated and banned. This one is related to a religious taboo. Like this, there are more problems. In order to resolve them,I think, it is important not only for Facebook to choose photos carefully, but also for everyone to understand that each person has each standard."
7709,"I agree with you. The more technology develops, the fewer chances we will have to write kanji, which will certainly lead to losing the ability to use kanji in a daily life. We should protect it and make it sure that future generations will write kanji."
7710,"I believe your idea to solve the problem is reasonable. Besides yours, I also suggest that the Japanese government offer more jobs for elderly people."
7711,"I agree with you. We should take this problem more seriously. In the future, the number of young people will continue to decrease, which causes many problems, such as economic difficulties. Thus, before we can do nothing to solve the problem, everyone in Japan should think about what they can do and carry out it."
7712,"I think that the death penalty should be abolished. Even if it is murderers, people should not kill them. This is morally wrong. Moreover, they should make up for their crimes until they die. If they are killed by the death penalty, they can feel nothing, which is irresponsible. I know this is one of the most difficult topics, but we have to think seriously and get an answer."
7714,"I agree with you. Fortunately, this time was failed. But if it were to success, Japan would put at risk."
7715,I agree with you. Incidents like this occur many times in Japan. Japan should think about these in order to stop incident like this.
7717,"I agree with you. Whatever he is gay, he have a human right. So Japan allow same-sex couples to marry."
7718,I agree with you. Banning illegal download save musician. And illegal download violate copyright. So from this point this law is desirable.
7719,"In my opinion, some pictures that hurt feelings of other people should be restricted, because images influence greatly to feelings and thoughts, especially young people. For example, images that are bad for education and incite young people to commit a crime also should be banned. However, Facebook should reveal the standard, that is, which picture is OK and which picture is banned. This is very difficult and hard thing, because the standard is different from culture to culture. But I can only mention that Facebook shouldn't have allowed celebrities such as Kim Kardashian to pose with body paint covering her nipples. This is very unfair. I thought Facebook were going too far."
7722,"I think that we should have the idea of firm fairness.These days more and more people are raising objections to different discriminations,but it is not enough. In the end,discriminations that have taken root in the world are not rather gone.Probably,all you can do is love neighbors fairly."
7723,"I think it is difficult to decide what kinds of photos are banned. I have a Facebook account,too. I don't worry about nothing when I put a picture. Everyone else would think so, too. And today, SNS like Facebook and Twitter are very popular. So I think it is a very difficult problem."
7724,"I think that it is a complicated problem to decide which kind of photos should be banned to post.Today,social networking services like Facebook ,twitter and Instagram are developed and many people all over the world can see other people's post easily.Therefore,it is not good idea to forgive all users to post any kind of photos without any rules.However,the standards deciding which photos are unforgiven to be posted.We should think about it to make better rules for public manners"
7725,"I think that the aged society with a low birth rate is one of the biggest problems in Japan.In this society many difficulties lie ahead of young Japanese people such as old-age pension,national debt,and a drop of demographic dividend. However,they still have a lot of opportunities to lead a successful life. Its way is that they become an international-minded person.This is because Japan went into the aged society,but the world is completely opposite.So,it is no reason that they are pessimists."
7726,"I think so,too.Mr.Miura show us that man can grow old wonderfully."
7728,"I agree with you.I think indeed you should not violate fundamental human rights of LGBT unnecessarily,but you should make a clear distinction between normal and abnormal couples.It is strange both of them have the same legal right,although they have differences in a physical and physiological way."
7729,SNS like twitter and Facebook have spread and many people use it. But now the people who post an inappropriate photograph to SNS increase. It is difficult to decide what kinds of photos should be banned to post. I think that people who post photos to SNS should be careful whether there isn't a person who does unpleasant concern with a picture.
7730,"I think it is a difficult problem. Because this picture can be seen appropriate or not. Therefore I think banning this picture by Facebook should not be criticized. However, the case of Kim Kardashian gives opponents grounds to blame. So if Facebook continue to ban this kind of photos, he should apply the rule more strictly."
7731,I agree with you . I think Japan should become tolerant about same-sex couples because human is equal.
7732,I agree with you. It is necessary to know the religion of the country to not involved in the trouble when we visit foreign country.
7733,"I agree with you. I think that everyone has freedom of expression,too. So, we have to consider this problem and respect other's expression."
7734,"I agree with you. To solve this problem,people should be careful when they post a photo."
7735,I agree with you. All countries should cope with North Korea before North Korea have a strong power.
7736,"I think restrict captain's license is a good idea. Most of captains are good but some of them are irresponsible. So, not only South Korea but also other countries need revisions of licence to prevent accidents like this."
7737,"I really agree with you. These days the discrimination of women in society has been decreasing. However, there are some people who says thoughtless things. But I think it was bad to throw eggs. Everyone has to think before acting."
7738,"I think that government should make the opportunity that elderly people can work. Japan should use an elderly person to develop economically. In the society which globalization goes ahead, the economic growth is important. An elderly people is important to Japan which has an aging population."
7742,"I also worry about the North Korean actions. If the launch of a missile succeeds, it would have a big and serious influence on us. The relationship between North Korea and, Japan and the U.S. would become worse, which could lead to a world war. In order to prevent this from happening, Japan should hold more conferences with countries around Japan and consider how Japan gets along with them."
7745,"I agree with you. In Japan, there is no specific religion and people rarely conflict because of religion. However, there is a large variety of religion in the world and people have different believes. We have to understand each other without hurting others. People should not think that their thought is always correct and should accept others' thought tolerantly."
7750,"What to think in this issue is what define the difference between ugliness and prettiness. Facebook, that is SNS used by people all over the world, made a decision to define plus-sized model as 'ugly'. All of people should be under equality, so we can think this decision was not correct. However, Facebook claimed that decision is based on 'community standard', so not a little people define the line between ugliness and prettiness. A few years ago, this line was common sense of all over the world and still extent the thinking now. But as you know, anything of world have been changing and the cultures, histories and societies also have been changing, so 'community standard' cannot exist forever, I think. Facebook's decision was certainly based on 'community standard', but it is not now 'community standard'."
7751,"I think so, too. Occasionally, same-sex relationship is still watched likely illness. That is unacceptable. We should accept the feelings of same-sex couples and come true the world that they can feel livable and comfortable. This is very difficult, but we have to do."
7753,"I, too, think it is difficult for to decrease illegal downloading because of its ease and convenience. But I think the punishment should not be mitigated. The problem is those who illegally download music think if do so, it will not come out. So those who possess illegally downloaded music or films should be cracked down more strictly."
7754,"Recently, there are many kinds of images on a SNS, such as Twitter, Facebook, and so on. And anyone can upload any images as long as the image are not too sexual or too violent. We have the right of expression and perspective of ours can differ from each other, so our expression on SNS should be more free."
7755,"I was surprised at reading this article. Young people has often used the SNS. For example, Twitter and line, and such as Face book. But I don't know this news.Although we usually have up easily, such as the SNS of others photos and videos, it should continue to take advantage of the SNS a little more thought."
7756,"I believe advertisement is freedom of expression, this means basically anything should be allowed advertising unless it goes against morality extremely. Then I think the images of fat women or topless women do not go against morality. At least, only one people, one group or one company should not decide whether the images are relevant or not."
7759,"I agree with you. Nuclear power is dangerous, so we should not rely on it. In order not to repeat the accident like Fukushima disaster, we have to look for alternative energy. Japan should use nature's power more effectively because Japan has variety of renewable energy for example geotherm."
7760,"I agree with you. I sympathize with your opinion that the idea is creative and nice although it takes lots of money. Everyone looks traffic lights, so gay and straight traffic lights give us good chance to consider gender problem. I hope the government introduce more campaign and promote people to understand gay people."
7763,"Facebook is used all over the world and many people post their photos and composition on the basis of their culture,custom,ideology and belief.So it is dangerous that Facebook bans posts by only one standard of Facebook. Of course, a person who updates his posts should understand that many people see it and be careful not to make someone unpleasant."
7765,"There are many people who have various beliefs, so I thought this issue can't be helped in a way. However, I can't affirm judging people by the outlook. Therefore, I thought it was right that there were people who appealed against the rejection of Facebook. We can't violate the right to freedom of expression, but more, we can't violate the human rights."
7766,"I agree with this idea.Even if burning fuel makes greenhouse gas emissions increase, we should stop nuclear power generation because it is too dangerous.In addition.with Japanese high technology, renewable energy will be able to cover Japanese electricity in a few years."
7767,"I think so too. Because politicians can decide our future. Therefore they should face politics seriously. Who votes for such candidates. At least I do not vote for them. Do you Know Mac Akasaka who is a candidate for Japanese elections? He always wore funny costumes and always lost. I think what he really wants is not being elected, but appealing himself. These actions are free. So, the important thing is whom voters elect."
7770,"Generally,Values vary from person to person.So,this problem is too difficult to solve. However,I learned a lot from this article. First,we should take a broad view of things. Second,we need to accept the differences of values."
7771,I was surprised this article. I think tattoo is not big issue. But people in Sri Lanka are particularly sensitive about images of the Buddha. I thought religion is serious problem. But arresting is too strict measures. So we should consider about religion issues.
7773,"Recently, there are many pictures on SNS. So I think company have to control violent and unpleasant expression. But this limitation is too strict and not quite rational. I do not know who is watching my SNS. So I should be careful myself."
7774,I agree with your opinion. Nuclear plant is so dangerous. Thinking about new energy is very difficult and important. But we must do someday. Let's work hard together
7775,I agree with your opinion. This problem is very important for Japan and Japanese future. Thinking about new energy is very difficult and important. But we must do someday. Let's work hard together
7776,I agree with your opinion. This problem is very important for Japan and Japanese future. Also nuclear plant is very dangerous. So thinking about new energy is very difficult and important. I hope that technology is developed.
7777,I agree with your opinion. This problem is very important for Japan and Japanese future. Also nuclear plant is very dangerous. So thinking about new energy is very difficult and important. I hope that technology is developed.
7778,I agree with this idea.I think respecting others is a best way in considering religions or cultures problem.
7779,"I agree with your opinion.Though Nuclear generation makes less greenhouse gas emissions, we should not look away from Fukushima disaster."
7780,"I think so too. He is a pride of Japanese, and I wish I could be such a great old man someday."
7781,I think so too. Freedom of religion should be protect.
7782,"I was surprised heard this news that FACEBOOK banned such a picture. Each people have a freedom of expression, A big size model should not be treated as unfairly. I think even if some feature show unhealthy, most people do not remind it.So Facebook should not manage too much for users."
7783,"A big social media like Facebook should act properly. Because there is a big amount of users using it. Facebook should be considerable to various people. Or it will easily hurt some of its users. What:s more, as a huge social media, it has its responsibility not to make misunderstandings. People may influenced by the pictures posed on Facebook."
7785,"I agree with you. If the population of people aged 65 or over occupy high rate of Japanese population, Japan should make an environment that elderly people can work for a long period. Only rely on young people's working is not enough to sustain Japanese economy when the population problem becomes true."
7787,I do not believe that there is an example that can not be entry by the tattoo of Buddha. It is difficult to understand because the religion of the problem is there is little to Japan.
7788,"North Korea for me is the unknown country. I'm scared every time you hear the news of the missile tests. Since Japan and North Korea are close, I think that may get used to the good relationship someday."
7789,"This is like a censorship. Facebook clearly took a mistake. There was no evidence that someone felt uncomfortable about the image of a plus-sized model , Tess Holliday . I think it's not too late to ban the photo of her after someone who looks at it tells Facebook to stop coming out the photo. However , some might say that people should comply the policy of Facebook. I think this opinion is partly right."
7792,"I agree with your opinion. The most important thing is understanding each other and tolerance for the diversity. We should believe that all people are guaranteed freedom of religion, this means also we must respect law or custom each other to live in peace."
7793,"I agree with you. Especially we, Japanese, should be aware of religions. When thinking about humans' history that have killed too many people because of religious problems, I deplore humans' ignorance."
7794,"I really think so. All people must learn and understand many religions, and all people have to accept and respect each other. To live this century peaceful, we Japanese can lead the world of friendship because we basically have no strong religion."
7795,I agree with you. One of our dreams is allowing living free life each other at least since 18th century. And now 21th century we must endeavor to complete our dreams and must guarantee the new freedom (sexual issue etc).
7796,I was surprised too. I think this limitation is too strict. We should be careful myself. We should pay attention to how to use SNS.
7797,"I was surprised at this news because I am a Facebook user too. I agree with Chercez la femme ' s opinion , so this rejecting of Facebook was not good. However I think Too Fat problem is not more important than the problem of topless photos. Because there are no reason to change the treatment of two Topless photos. Unlike the case of Too Fat photos, there were no policies that could explain why there were the difference between the treatment of the photos of topless aboriginal women and that of celebrities. It means that this is an racial discrimination. Racial discrimination should NOT be allowed to exist among the people. Then I think the 2nd (older) fact of this news is more important for us."
7798,I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. We have to solve them. Let's work hard together!
7799,I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. We have to solve them. Let's work hard together!
7800,I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. I think it is important to respect and accept each other too.
7801,I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. I think I should know more about any religions through this news.
7802,I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. Even so I think this treatment is too strict.
7803,I think this problem is difficult to solve. And I was surprised this article too. Many Japanese do not have one's religious. So we are out of touch on religious issues. But there are many religious problem around the world. I think I should know more about any religions through this news.
7804,I agree with you. This is unbelievable story. When I read it for the first time I was so surprised too. I think Mr. Miura trained so hard. I respect his challenging spirit.
7806,I think so too. SNS should be the place where the freedom of speech is respected.
7807,I think so too. It is true that nuclear power can generate electricity more efficiently than renewable energy. But we should exploit the alternative energy resources for the sustainable society.
7808,I agree with you. I hope that those attempts are spreading all over the world. And also I suppose we must make every effort to remove these prejudices one by one.
7809,"I agree with you. Every opinion whether it is majority or not should be respected by any people, I think."
7810,I was also surprised to read this news . I thought that we shouldn't set the limits of what we can do on our own . I wanna achieve a big success in the future!
7811,Yes. We can learn many lessons from his attitude. I tend to give up difficult trials.
7812,"The most wonderful point of that campaign is probably it was on the traffic lights because it became more effective campaign. I think it was a nice idea, too. However, there are some people that oppose those sexual diversity. I think religious problem is one of big obstacles. Anyway we should make efforts from day to day."
7813,"I also respect his attitude that affects our way of life. And of course , his act gives powerful incentives to those who are about as old as him."
7814,"I think your opinion is great. Actually those attempts are good, but those apt to hurt minority's feelings indeed. When I read your opinion, I noticed new aspects of this problem."
7815,"I do not think so. If they set too strange decorations on traffic lights, drivers and pedestrians are confused and actually it would be too dangerous. However at least in that case, those decorations do not cause accidents, I suppose."
7816,"Now, about 90 percent of Japan's electricity is supplied by burning oil, coal, and LPG. To increase CO2 gas emissions is big problem from the other point of view, so It is certainly necessary for us to use nuclear resources. However, using it may cause disaster and lost the territory or people. We must replace nuclear power with renewable resources for future."
7817,"I agree with you. Actually I admit that same sex couples are not natural. However, to respect those individual's issues is humanity. So the laws should not prohibit same sex marriage, I think."
7818,"I think your viewpoint is great. It is true that from the perspectives of safety , this policy doesn't necessarily solve the problem. We have to consider not only the importance of consideration to gender minority but also safety."
7819,"I think so, too! His challenges are great, and he must be the star of an aging society."
7820,I agree with you. We have many things to be learned from him.
7821,We have to make stop terrorism. We should think happiness.
7822,"I really agree with you. Although Prime Minister Abe promotes nuclear power, I think it is too dangerous for not only Japan but also all over the world, and also not only humans but also the whole nature. In addition, there are too many earth quakes on the Japan islands, so those islands are not proper to build nuclear power plants."
7824,"I agree with you. If we hope to continue relying on electricity, we must endeavor to get renewable energy, I think."
7825,Candidate should wear their clothes which are appropriate to the occasion. They should have a recognize of responsibility.
7826,I question whether nuclear power is necessary for Japan. Because we could get enough electricity after every nuclear power plant were shut down since 2011. So I think we should think and discuss about this basic problem.
7827,"I agree with you. In my opinion,democracy 's success is not important. I disagree with the Nobel Peace prize."
7828,I agree with you. Facebook does not have a right to make such a judgement. It is like a violation of human rights.
7829,"This is a complicated issue of the Internet moral and rights of expression. We all have rights to post we want to unless we hurt persons' feelings whose see the comment. In this case, the problem is the standards of Facebook is extremely strict. Neither plus sized model nor naked aboriginal women make us unpleasant. Facebook should protect Internet manners from different angles."
7830,"I agree with your idea 'our expression on SNS should be more free'. But I feel we need legitimate regulation to save our human rights too. In fact we don't have the way to regulate correctly. So there are too much discrimination expressions now. I've heard that the computers that regulate any online expressions are not good at judging whether or not be forgiven. Now I'm confused on which is more important, the free of expression or the regulation of bad expression. I want to know your thought."
7831,"Reading your post, I understand your thought and feel you're right. But I have other idea about banning . You said 'We should think and pay attention by myself' from line 5 to line 7 and ,maybe, this means Not company but we users should regulate by myself . I can't agree your idea about 'Who regulate'. Of course your idea is ideal, however there are a lot of expressions that hurt the human rights like hate speeches. Then I think it's important to regulate legitimately by company in equal stance."
7832,I'm surprised at your point of view. Because I think this problem is about discrimination by company only. So your view is unique for me especially about 'ugly or pretty?'. I like it. I agree with your idea. I think the SNSs like Facebook should NOT be the MEASURE of how beautiful.
7834,"I agree with your idea especially about last sentence. Current states of policy is not clear and this caused misunderstanding and troubles like this article. So I think like you , Facebook should remake their policy."
7835,"I was surprised and afraid when I read this article. It is because I usually use Facebook, but I have never thought deeply about putting pictures. Moreover, SNS will develop and the chance that we use them will increase. Therefore, we have to consider this problem seriously."
7836,"Your opinion is right and I think so. But I think we Japanese should go next step about religions. Of course in Japan, it's true that the topic about religions is one of taboos. However we've enough escaped from religions problem. Now, 21century, it's said a global century. In the such a century, can we make good relationship with foreigners by escaping the topic about religions? I don't think we can. So now we should have much more interest on the difference between foreigner and us. Then we can't think more about them without thinking religions."
7838,I was surprised when I read this news. Facebook's behavior was so rudeness for fat people. Recently SNS's pictures are big problems. But control of these are big problems too. So everyone should be careful for these problems.
7839,I think so. Facebook took mistakes. And I think Tess's feelings. But the policy is very important.
7840,I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. And the Internet's rule is uncertain. So everyone should have the heart of consideration.
7841,"I'm surprised too, not only Naomi but also Japanese people should understand more about foreign culture and religions. There are big differences about religions between Japan and other countries .In japan, talking about religions is one taboo. This is big problem I think."
7844,"I think so. This is so sad. Okinawa has the war and the capture history. But now, Okinawa doesn't escape from American army. The prime minister Abe should work on Okinawa's problem."
7845,"In fact, I had a prejudices to them before reading this article. I've heard there were a lot of gay couples in the world and I saw the news about Hollywood gay couples. However I couldn't feel this is familiar to my life. I didn't believe this is real. Maybe most Japanese feel this is not near our real life. So this attempt in Vienna is very good, I think. In Japan, these attempt like Vienna should be done!"
7847,"I agree with your opinion. There is much timing that we use Kanji in our society and Japanese culture such as Nengajou, calligraphy, and so on. Therefore, we should have pride as Japanese and increase the opportunity to write kanji."
7848,I think so too. the nuclear energy helped Japan's electricity demand. But nuclear energy is so dangerous. So we have to face up to a energy problem.
7850,"I agree with you. Recently, we hardly use pens. So we use smartphones and keyboards. And we use conversions. Then we don't write Kanji and forget handwriting of it. We should use pens and write Kanji by handwriting."
7851,I think so too. Everyone has the right of loving each other. Everyone has the right to marry with their loving man.
7853,I think so. I surprised to this news. This new traffic light will be change people's behavior.
7854,"I was very surprised after reading this news. Even though I always use Facebook I did not notice that this kind of problem was happening. People should have the freedom to upload whatever type of picture they prefer. The tact that Facebook has been deleting fat peoples pictures is hard to believe. I don't think that standing on the belief that slender people are healthy is an objective view. How do you respond to the opinion that skinny people does not have enough nutrition to be healthy. Who can judge the appropriate weight for each individuals. In order to keep the net society healthy, I think Facebook should also have a healthy view to this issue."
7856,"In my family, the male has very short life. So my challenge is living so long. In my family, males don't pay attention to their health and work too hard. Then I won't work too hard, and I'll make it a rule to eat vegetables every day and sleep well. My first challenge is eating ,my biggest rival in my life, eggplant."
7857,"I do not agree with your opinion. Of course, development of autonomous car will make our life more comfortable. However, it will cause difficult problems. For example, when having caused an accident these car, it won't be decided whose crime it will be by present law. Therefore, as far as there are this problems, our life will not become comfortable perfectly.."
7861,"I think it is difficult issue too.I cannot decide whether US troops should stay in Okinawa or leave.For Okinawa people,they must want US troops move away.Because of noise or danger.But some of Japanese may think US troops should stay for Japan's safety.So I have same idea with you.We should discuss more about this issue."
7863,I cannot believe too!How expensive it is!I have watched Picasso painting.But I could not understand his painting.Because I don't have sense of art.So I hope the person who knocked this painting down have sense of art.And the successful bidder can understand Picasso exactly.
7865,"I was very surprised when I read this article. It is because I usually use Facebook, but I have never thought to use Facebook may lead to dangerous situation. The technology will develop and the chance we use them may increase.."
7867,Your idea is so cool!I have never thought about it.You suggest how to decrease discrimination.'Love neighbor fairly' is easy to do.But we cannot think of it.So since today I decide to love neighbors fairly deliberately.
7870,"I don't agree with your idea. Of course I know the dangerous of nuclear, but this technology is better power generation efficiency than other way. Nuclear is so dangerous but gives us a lot of benefit. We should make much more safe system."
7873,"I think FB should do more considerable behave. FB is the best worldwide SNS, so users who use FB are variety of people about race, religion and custom. This case is not only hurt plus-size people, but also FB regarded to make discrimination by some people. FB must know and make sure of people's personalities."
7874,"I think we can resolve many problem that permitting same-sex marriage cause by being serious. For example, we can make the plan that to help parents the government gives them some money."
7875,"I think SNS is so useful and meaningful for us to communicate in any case. However, we must be careful to use it because we will be suffered from all problems on the SNS. The young especially be careful problem on SNS, because they can't be responsible for problem. And, their parents would be responsible for it. I don't think they can fly the approach of danger unless they are really be careful. SNS have developed to have comfortable time in our life. In other words, our life is uncovered by SNS. Also, I don't want anyone to use without having the goodness good-like purpose. In essence, I hope everyone don't feel danger by someone leaving minus messages. Finally, I wrote some issue and solution about SNS.and I want you to consider about it carefully. If you can find some solution, I want you to act positively. We never supposed to forget Moral of modern society."
7877,"I agree with your opinion. This is difficult problem , because they should not encourage unhealthy diet but too fat body may has some problems such as Lifestyle-related diseases."
7878,"I think SNS is so useful and meaningful for us to communicate in any case. However, we must be careful to use it because we will be suffered from all problems on the SNS. The young especially be careful problem on SNS, because they can't be responsible for problem. And, their parents would be responsible for it. I don't think they can fly the approach of danger unless they are really be careful. SNS have developed to have comfortable time in our life. In other words, our life is uncovered by SNS. Also, I don't want anyone to use without having the goodness good-like purpose. In essence, I hope everyone don't feel danger by someone leaving minus messages. Finally, I wrote some issue and solution about SNS.and I want you to consider about it carefully. If you can find some solution, I want you to act positively. We never supposed to forget Moral of modern society."
7881,"I agree with your opinion. I think we need nuclear power now, but in the long run, we should use other power such as geothermal power. We should promote changing power more ecologically or economically for our future."
7882,I have same feelings wit you. Mr.Miura taught me the importance of challenge. I want to be a challenger like him.
7884,"I agree with you. It is true that Naomi's pious belief should be respected. However , we have to make an effort to understand the culture of the country."
7885,I agree with you. I was very surprised too and very proud of him. His climbing teased us 'Never give up'. It is very important thing in this life and I want to be an old woman like him.
7887,I also learned the importance of understanding the other cultures
7888,"I agree with you. I think young people are tolerance of them, but elders cannot accept them because they have old custom of gender. Japan should promote to recognize and understand same-sex couples."
7889,"I'm surprised too. There are a lot of old but super people. I'm much younger than them, I have a lot to do. I want try everything I can."
7890,"After I read your comments ,I can understand this is serious problem. We should consider this again/"
7892,"in order not to offend others' feelings. Japanese people rarely think of religions . However , we must recognize the fact that there are many lethal conflicts based on personal beliefs."
7893,"Your opinion is great! I think so. We should understand each other and accept the differences. I'm a user of Facebook, so I will share this news on it."
7894,"I agree with 'when in Rome, do as Romans do'. Travelers should respect and study local rules. To know other custom or tradition is good for understanding world each other."
7895,"Mr.Miura is one of the most hungriest people to train himself. His policy that he keep challenge the limit is informative for me, and we should respect his patient and effort. It is he that is model of human."
7898,"I agree with you. To change any public property because of spreading ideas like this is not waste of costs, I think. The movement like this should spread and promote for developing society in any other country, particularly Japan."
7900,"I agree with you.I'm from Fukushima,so I saw the devastated area with my own eyes.And I am keenly aware of horrors of nuclear power generation plant.These are difficult problems for us.However we face up to renewable energy."
7903,"I agree with you.I don't think that Facebook makes judgement about which photos make viewers feel unpleasant.We have the right to get enough information.Therefore,Facebook doesn't have the right to decide."
7904,I think my idea is similar to your opinion. Nuclear power is reasonable. But I think we must not use nuclear power. Because it has serious risk. For instance we don't know how to waste spent nuclear waste. It's dangerous which we use nuclear not to understand it.
7905,I agree with you. He is superman!
7906,"His oldness is deserved to surprise!!! When I become 80 years old, I will not able to just walk long distances."
7907,It is surprising that a old man climbed Mt. Everest. And that he did many times!!!! It worth pleasing so much!!
7908,"I was surprised by his age! He is 80 years old, right? It is unbelievable!!!"
7909,I don't wanna miss the soul you referred to. I will keep trying to make my life a better one!
7910,"I agree with you. Religious problems are very serious.I think we should more corporate many aspects and many things regardless of religion,too."
7911,I agree with you! SNS should be the free world to everyone!
7912,"SNS is a free opened spot to everyone. So whatever we do, they should be allowed in any pages."
7913,"I agree with your thought. 'I think it is important for us to struggle to make our society more equal ' I think so,too. it is a meaningful action to the gender problem.We must more think about this serious problems."
7918,I agree with this idea. Always North Korea tries to test the nuclear missiles and no one can be relaxed near North Korea. We are worried about the time when the war between America and North Korea occurs. The position of Japan are the middle of them so we have to think about that. i wish there is no war in the world!
7919,"I think that it is many problems to decide what kind of photos should be banned to post. In those days, social networking service like 'Twitter ' 'Facebook' 'Instagram' are developed and many people all over the world can see other people's post whenever easily.But,I think that it is not good idea to favorite all users to post without any rules.We should more think about it to make better rules for manners."
7920,"I agree with you. Recently people download music illegally. The Internet develops and it makes people to get the music easily. I heard that when my mom was a child, the CD is very rare and she was looking forward to buy her favorite artist CDs . She collected them. But now even though they are fans of that artist, some people do not buy CDs. The police in Japan has to be strict about the illegal downloading to protect artists."
7921,i agree with you! Facebook should be more tolerant to any person!
7922,I agree with you.Your think 'SNS should be equal to us' is very important thing.We should more this problems and SNS manners to everyone can use SNS in one of the equality.
7923,I agree with you. The line which decides what is good and what is bad depends on each other
7924,I agree with this. I am proud of this achievement as one of the Japanese. Mr Miura is always trying to do something in his life. He enjoys his life even though he became old. Trying to enjoy something at any age is very important!
7925,I was surprised to see this news. The traffic lights are very unique. And I think it is difficult for people around the world to see same-sex couples as everyday reality. So various actions like this should be done.
7926,I agree with you. SNS should be the place where we wont be violated in many ways.
7928,I agree with your opinion. I think these actions should be done beyond the cost.
7929,Fat people are just fat and they are also personalities. We shouldn't violate them.
7930,I agree with you. We should know how to use SNS more.
7931,Why FB is the best SNS in the world?? I love Twitter and I don't use FB often. This is because Twitter don't need many personal information.
7932,"i agree with this. Obama's re-election is meaningful to the American history I think. Because , he was the first Black president of the US. When he was elected for the first time, my grandpa said that i can't believe that the Black could become the president! Through the history, it is very meaningful! that shows us better world than before!"
7933,"I think so. SNS makes our society more comfortable. However,it causes various problems. It is difficult to solve these problems. We should be careful not to cause more problems."
7934,I agree with this. i think going to the museum and looking at the many pictures are not so fun. It is boring &gt;&lt; I know Picasso is very famous but i don&#039;t know why people want the painting for a lot of money.
7937,I think so. This action is very important and great. We should accept the difference of the values.
7938,"I think so. We should be careful for the difference of thought about religion. If we don't pay attention to it,various problem can be caused."
7939,"I think so, too, But this is very difficult. Because there are too much amount of religions to know. For example, Christ is divided Catholic, Protestant, etc. So three religions are the same origin, but they are very different. I think the most important thing is to understand and feel the culture or belief."
7940,"In my opinion, this correspondence is ridiculous. Do we extend the same concern towards those who recklessly endanger the public purse via willful motorcycling, horse-riding or rugby? There are many wholly voluntary activities that carry an increased likelihood of medical care, just seems odd that it's only fat people who ever get singled out for this argument."
7941,"Between Japan and North Korea, We have tense situation for long time. If North Korea success launching nuclear missiles, Japan will suffer nuclear bomb again. We should pay attention this country's intention."
7942,I was really surprised at this news. The age affects performance of people. However he achieved conquering Mount Everest in old age. Yuichiro Miura is very strong man. I respect his effort.
7943,"I want to challenge my limit too. For example, I will study English hard."
7944,"I am glad that Obama was re-elected, because his politics is familiar with Japan. Now Japan should strengthen relationship with America to oppose rogue nations."
7945,"I agree with your opinion. To create a pleasant environment for all users, administrators of these sites should handle all of problems with minute attention, I reckon."
7946,"After reading this Article,I think this punishment is not effective.Because the police can't arrest all people who download illegally.This change promote to prevent illegally download ,but it is not true.I think that we should use the internet carefully and care about ourselves."
7947,I agree with you. I think that it's very high cost to pay.We should more corporate with them and use the computer more carefully .
7948,"This is really complex problem, but I think we can't live without nuclear plants. There is no alternative to them in Japan now. In terms of Japan's financial institution, we have no leeway to generate renewable energy as this article says. It can't be helped for comfortable life."
7949,Not only Sony but also other Japanese companies don't have power to compete against overseas company such as Apple. The reason losing competition is Japanese company has no products witch attract many people.Japanese company should be strong to compete against other big companies.
7952,I think ruling Facebook's guideline is very difficult. It is because a lot of people around the world use Facebook. There are various cultural backgrounds. So it is very difficult not to offend all people's feelings.
7953,"I agree with your opinion. The bigger a social media is, the more attention should be payed."
7954,"Social network service such as Facebook put emphasis on appearance of advertisement. Surely, I can understand Facebook's mind. But Facebook should have not banned particular pictures. That is because people have freedom of expression. Companies should not prevent people from uploading pictures for financial reasons."
7956,"When I read the news, I found Japan is now facing dangerous problem. Young people decreasing and elderly people increasing will affect Japanese society badly. I think the government should promote young people to have children."
7958,This problem is one of the biggest and long-standing problem in Japan. The government should cope with it and find solutions before the situation that 40% of its population are non-working retirees would be turned into reality. Otherwise our burdens would continue to increase and make Japan's economic condition worse.
7959,I agree with you. Our incentive for working would decrease in such a condition. So we must find solutions against this problem as soon as possible.
7960,"I disagree with your idea. In my opinion, it is more efficient to find ways to protect hangers more stubbornly than to find out new ways to generate energies."
7961,I agree with you. It is amazing to keep in good shape at this age. We should learn his fighting spirit and health management.
7962,"I agree with the last word of your comment. Our tastes are individual for every person, and laughing and making fun of them are nonsense."
7963,"I agree with your opinion. Including me, Japanese people are really indifference to religious thought in every country. So we should learn about it more consciously, I think."
7964,I think so. It seems to me that the government forces Okinawa to take difficulty such as US base. So they should try to decrease the burdens of Okinawa.
7965,"I agree with you. It is not good to privatize relics like Pablo Picasso's 'Women of Algiers'. To enjoy looking and feeling at paintings, they should be managed by museums."
7966,"I think you have clairvoyance. Considering the problem of responsibility, it takes time to realize this fantasy."
7972,"I disagree with your opinion. As far as I know, there is no hero breaking the law."
7975,i agree with this idea. Not all Muslim are bad terrorists.. I can understand the ban of Muslim immigration may be one of the way to defend terrorism but some Muslims hope the peaceful society. I agree with Hilary Clinton. Her policy is better than Trump's. i want her to be the president!
7976,I agree with you. This is unbelievable story. When I read it for the first time I was so surprised too. I think Mr. Miura trained so hard. He is amazing!
7977,I agree with you. This is unbelievable story. When I read it for the first time I was so surprised too. I think Mr. Miura trained so hard. I respect his challenging spirit.
7978,"When I was heard the news, I thought that he is awesome. It is unbelievable that climb a mountain even if Mt.Fuji. He is not a old man but tough guy."
7979,"i agree with the idea that more workers lose jobs so the seller of automatic driving system cars need to care about that problem when they introduce the cars to consumers. The merit that using automatic cars is reducing car accidents however i have a question. Are they moving with gasoline?? More people uses the safety cars and using cars population going up , that means they need to be environmental friendly. Otherwise they develop global warming."
7980,I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equally. Choosing a girl friend or a mother is very hard question. If i were the person who has to chose i cannot find my answer. i think i want to save both so i want to try to help both of them. But we have rights to think freely so it is crazy that choosing girl friend is crime. Our decision are not right or wrong.
7981,I think that we should not use nuclear energy in Japan because Japan has many earthquakes. But we should not stop nuclear power plants immediately. We should speed up transition to renewable energy and stop using nuclear energy.
7984,"I agree with the idea. People have less chance to write Kanji because of the developing PC and smartphones. But we are Japanese and Kanji has long history so we should not forget hand-writing. As a Japanese , we need to important of Kanji and introduce the cool culture to the world."
7985,I agree with your opinion. And it means FB infringed on this kind of right.
7988,"I think it is difficult to decide which photo should be banned. There are many kinds of photos on the Internet and everyone can see it freely, so we should ban photos which are damaging children. In order to solve the problem, we have to set rules of banning which photo should be banned. I think plus-sized model is not bad. Facebook should set rules!"
7989,"I think that Facebook's decision is too strict. Social network service should should be open for all people. Facebook should learn to difference of opinion, perspective and culture."
7990,I agree with you. I was shocked by the DJs' insensibility. It is so foolish to dupe dead people. They should apologize sincerely for their remarks and not repeat such a rude thing.
7991,"this article is too important for us.I think Facebook page is official ,so people think deeply what write about"
7992,I was surprised when I read this news. Facebook's behavior was terrible for fat people. In Recent SNS's pictures are problems. But control of these are problems too. We should know how to use SNS more.
7993,"I agree with you! SNS is so useful and meaningful, but we should set rules of photos."
7994,I think that EU should not receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Because EU has many problems with immigration. Furthermore France and UK which member county of EU have nuclear weapons. It seems to me that power politics and far to say peaceful.
7996,"I agree with you. People use smartphones every day and they have less opportunity to write Kanji than before. It is sad that Kanji, which is one of the most important Japanese culture, is forgotten. They should try to get the opportunity to write Kanji more positively to protect it."
7997,"I agree with your opinion. If we go to foreign country, we should respect local culture and observe the local rule."
7998,"I agree with you. Certainly, his actions may receive public attention, but I can't feel his sincerity from his attitudes for example his remark that his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. People like him should not be a politician."
7999,"I think that it is very serious problem. If young population is declining, politician make a policy for older person. But if do so, baby will be declining. And Japan's pension system will be breakdown."
8000,"No, I don't. I'm sorry. Do you have any idea ??"
8001,I agree with you. It is difficult to distinguish good and bad photos for all of us because we have different sense of value.
8002,"I agree with you. There are many religions and taboos in the world. They are differs from each other, of course, however, we should accept each other. It is impossible that everyone has the same religious beliefs, so it is important to try to learn other people's religious taboos."
8003,"I agree with you. In many countries, including Japan, gay-couples are more or less persecuted. I hope many countries will take some measures to accept gay-couples like Austria did."
8004,"I agree with you. We tend to think if we couldn't do something at the right time it would be too late, however, Mr. Miura taught us there is nothing which is too late to do if we really want to achieve."
8005,I agree with you. We should not depend on nuclear power in such a dangerous island.
8006,Electricity is very important in modern lives. But We don't have to make them by killing people. We should use renewable energy more and unclear power less.
8007,"The internet should be the free world contrast to our real world. If we cant get any information from the internet, we wont be able to judge what is good or bad. So any information should be allowed in the world of the internet."
8008,"I agree with you. Japan has little fuel such as coals and gases, so considering our economy, it is difficult to get away with nuclear power. I think we should use it until the alternative is discovered."
8009,"I think so too. We should pay attention to how to use SNS. I think, we should also pay attention how SNS company use our personal information."
8011,I agree with the opinion. All lives are equal. Imagining that is very difficult and important. We should think about it more.
8013,"I agree with you. When I heard this news,I was surprised and sad. Although we have freedom in this country,jeering at the prime minister is not good ."
8015,"I don't think so because most of the car accidents are brought about by human error. And in this article , it is not written that normal automobile will completely disappear from this world. Those who like to drive by themselves can drive a normal car."
8016,"I partly agree with you. It is important to think about this problem from now. However, if we let elderly people to work for a long period, many young people might not be able to get jobs."
8017,"I don't think so because most of the car accidents are brought about by human error. And in this article , it is not written that normal automobile will completely disappear from this world. Those who like to drive by themselves can drive a normal car."
8018,"I agree with you. It is true,the number of car accidents and traffic fatalities will decrease. However, that the number of people who do not have driver license and drive a car is problem."
8021,I think so too. This idea so effective and important.
8022,I think so too. I would like to try big challenge like him someday.
8023,I agree with you. The number of elderly people is increasing is bad problem. We should solve this problem.
8024,I do not think so. Nobody have right to interfere with other's hobby.
8025,I agree with you. Refugees are held like criminals. It's wrong to invade human lights.
8026,I agree with you. National flag presents national spirit. this trend is proper.
8027,I agree with you. This event will make woman stop working.
8028,"I agree with you.If I same thing happen to me, I won't feel good."
8029,"I was just surprised to read this article because in Japan, for instance, the right of expression is really respected and no one is allowed to violate the right. I think we need to be more generous about the right of expression. What do you think?"
8030,"I don't agree with you. Of course, I can understand your idea to some extent, but now, Japan is heavily depending on nuclear power. And I think there are no other renewable source."
8031,I agree with you! When I read this article I thought Facebook should have censor some photos that can be harmful for children but they didn't need to censor others.
8032,I agree with you. I think pictures of plus size model are not undesirable.
8033,"I agree with you because the nuclear power is dangerous for us and especially in Japan, there are a lot of other effective way to generate power, right?"
8034,i was moved very much indeed just like you! I think I want to be powerful man like him someday!
8035,I agree with you because I think people should be respected without the specific reasons. I mean we do not discriminate specific people just because they are LGBT!
8036,If you think new traffic lights in Vienna are very good. Why don't we take an action to promote the new traffic lights like Vienna in Japan!
8038,I completely agree with you! I think it is important to know how the people of the country get along with its religious belief before going to the country.
8043,If I were put into the same situation I wouldn't decide which one to choose and I do not like this kind of test.
8044,When I read through this article I was able to think about a variety of things like how limited my own knowledge was about CO2 emission. Also I felt we needed to think about how we could reduce CO2 emission.
8045,I think he is really respectful person as you mentioned. Is there anyone else you really respect from the bottom of your heart?
8046,We should be allowed to express whatever we want to on SNS as long as it is not harmful.
8047,I think this is very serious problem in Japan. Increasing the percentage of elderly people cause economic stagnation. So government needs to have a solution for that. Japan tend to retire when they got 60 or 65. I think employer needs to hire them only if they still have ability to work.
8048,"I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems."
8053,I was surprised to read this article. It is difficult for Facebook to judge whether the picture is good to show or not. So I think Facebook should judge after someone reports 'the pic is bad to show' like that.
8056,I think so too. I don't know how we should do. so I believe they can do.
8057,"The problem in the event is that Facebook telling the photo of a plus-sized model it made people feel bad and banning it. I think this is the discrimination against plus-sized people. Nowadays, a lot of people around the world use Facebook. So, the judgement of Facebook may have made plus-sized users. Facebook side should realize its influence and pay attention to its statement."
8058,"I was surprised by this news because I couldn't believe that Philippine president let drug sellers be killed. However, I thought it might have necessity to do so, because if he didn't Philippine could be the 'narco-state'. In Philippine, there are lot of poor people and in order not to make them use or deal drugs, it might need strict restrictions."
8059,"I was surprised to hear this news because killings like this rarely happen in japan. It is true that using and selling drugs are very bad, however when it comes to punishing them, I think that we don't have to kill them. We have to think another better ways in order to get them back into society."
8060,I was surprised by this news because many people have been killed by Rodrigo's crackdown. But his crackdown decreased the number of Philippine's crime. So I think it's not bad crackdown.
8061,"When I read this news, I felt a lot. First of all, I personally don't believe in the death penalty because a bunch of researchers conducted a study and discovered that a significant number of people sentenced to death were actually innocent. And I think our justice system is too subjective to be reliable enough to decide whether someone lives or not. Therefore, I think any world leader who decides that killing people is an appropriate way to stop drug crime is both immoral and impractical. I think killing all those people and boasting about it will probably only make it worse.Second, I really believe that people selling serious illegal drugs should be imprisoned but people who are addicted should not be either imprisoned or sentenced to death, instead they should be sent to rehabilitation centers. By doing this, I really want to give them a chance."
8062,"When I read this news, I was first surprised at the reality that the number of people who involved in the drugs is very large. I know that number from the Duterte's comment that 100000 people would be killed during his crackdown. I think many people involved in the drugs because Philippine government hadn't made enough policy to punish the drugs. Thinking such situation, Philippine president began to take action in order to improve the drug problem is good. However, the way Duterte took to punish people who involved in the drugs is too radical. Even if the people who killed are drug users or sellers and the people who kill are policemen, this punishment is radical. Killing people for the drugs is not an appropriate punishment. I think the good way to punish people involved in the drugs is arresting them, teaching them the drug's bad influence to their bodies and making them to reflect on their life. Philippine government should do the campaign to teach citizens hoe drug is bad for human instead of killing people. Therefore, I cannot agree with Duterte's radical campaign."
8063,"I was shocked at this news. The idea that to control narcotics is not wrong. However, Duterte's way is too strict. There are a lot of killed people, but some of them may be innocent. A false accusation is impermissible, because they have already been killed. There are few people who reject his crackdown, so the way may be not bad. But it has a severe problem. So we must consider another way, I think."
8064,"I think Duterte goes too far because people who are not guilty in fact are usually killed. He is often compared with the Republican candidate,Donald Trump. But I think there is the subtle difference between these two Politicians. Trump's claim is somewhat to the point that the jobs in the USA have surely been deprived by the immigrants from Mexico. But Duterte kills the people who may not be guilty in realty. Anyway,the two Politicians exaggerate the fact,and are arrogant."
8065,"I was surprised at the number of people who use the drugs. To be sure,it is important to kill criminals,but it is also essential to educate people (especially children) that the drugs are very dangerous."
8066,"Duterte kills too much people. First I read this article, I think he is cruel person. He doesn't deserves to be president. But my first impression is not right. Because drugs are widespread in Philippine than I had imagined. He may think that is the only way to eradicate this evil root and branch. I think so too. He should kill both of selling and using drugs people. However he's thought will be not acceptable even Duterte's policy has excellent effect at illegal drug. Because he kill too much, it's not nomocracy and they worry about a false accusation. I hope he makes Philippine more safe country. But he should kill only the person who committed a crime for sure. It's the most important thing."
8067,"This news actually shocked me very much. In modern society, I cannot imagine such a inhuman happening still exist today. I reckon there must a less-restricting method to solve this problem. The country shouldn't ignore the international criticize and looking for a better way to restrict the illegal crimes."
8068,"When I read this news for the first time, I was surprised at the real situation a number of people were killed by the president. I don't agree with Duterte's radical campaign. I think many people involved in the drugs because Philippine government hadn't made enough policy to punish them. Take into consideration, Philippine president should start to take action in order to improve these situations. However, the way Duterte took to punish people who involved in the drugs is too radical. Even if punishing drag criminals, killing them is crackdown by only President Rodrigo Duterte's enormous power. This situation is not Democracy but Dictatorship, I think. In my opinion, the good way to punish drag criminals is arresting them, teaching them the drug's bad influence to their bodies and spirits. Therefore, I disagree with Duterte's radical campaign."
8069,"The most interesting and thought-provoking thing in this affair is that Mr. Duterte had taken the legal profession before he took office as a politician. In this case, generally, he should be in a position to strictly observe the law, but he goes contrary. This means, I think, he realized the limitations of the current law as to how to punish drug offenders when he was in the legal profession. Considering drug crimes now prevailing in the Philippines, certainly, you can find the current law is hardly working. If that's how it is, his illegal act needs more consideration before some lightheaded criticism."
8070,"I was surprised at the number of people who use the drugs and too much people killed by Duterte I don't imagine and believe that people killed by own country's President. so I don't agree with Duterte's radical campaign. I think Duterte is very cruel person. In my opinion, the good way to punish drag criminals is arresting people."
8071,"The measures to rid the country of illegal drugs should be taken in The Philippines. I think, however, the measures taken by Duterte isn't appropriate. He need to think why they are using illegal drugs. To kill drug users or people who are involved in drug trade brings about only a fear. By the report of the International Society for Criminology , there are few education for not abusing illegal drugs at the school in the Philippines. From this report, we can find that drug users may not understand why we mustn't use illegal drugs. If they learn it, a number of them may decrease and Duterte might not take such cruel measures."
8072,"I was very surprised when I heard this news. I approve crackdown but I think the way his crackdown is wrong. Before killing, I think it should be examined conservantly whether they use a drug really."
8073,"I was surprised by this news because I couldn't believe that Philippine president let drug sellers be killed.I think that this problem could be solved in other ways.For example, as are in the jail."
8074,"At the fist time, I was surprised by this news. I just though how rude is this president! But after I read the news for the second time. I found that we should admit the severity of this problem. So that it do should be taken some strict measures. However, President Duterte is overstrict i think. Maybe it could be punished by closed in prison for many years or forever. But not be killed. Lives is much more precious than Duterte think I suppose. It refers to the issue of human rights. In my opinion, a criminal's basic rights should also be respected."
8075,"I think Rodrigo's policy is not good way to decrease drug users . This is because sometimes the people who are using drugs want to stop using but they cannot stop it by themselves. They are too addicted to quit it. So if they are going to be killed as President policy , they would not have chances to quit."
8076,"I was surprised at this news, because this is a really extreme measure that cannot be true in today's world.I think drug dealers must be punished strictly, but Philippine president should not kill them."
8077,"I was surprised to hear this news. I cannot believe that the government impose death penalty on people who sold and bought illegal drugs. In my opinion,they should impose death penalty on only people selling illegal drugs. People who are addicted should be sent to rehabilitation center."
8078,"I felt it is not good idea to kill all people who was suspected of referring to narcotics trade. Every country which ruled by law needs to think about the benefit of the doubt. Kill someone before proven he is guilty, it is same as murderer who need to be punished. I want Duterte to think again about his decision and behavior."
8079,"I was shocked to read this article. Trading narcotics is a bad action and people doing it should be punished. Now in Philippine, they are treated by the capital punishment. I feel this is too cruel. The would be another way to punish them. For example, they should be rehabilitated in facilities or hospitals. Then, I was also surprised that people in Philippine support Duterte. From this fact, I can realise they hope narcotics trade will disappear. Not only in Philippine but also around the world, such actions should vanish, so we have to come up with better ways."
8080,"I was surprised to know this news. Because, Philippine is a tropical island I thought, however, it is in the hotbed of narcotics and use brutal way to wipe out criminals. Slaughter is not good way to make peace, but Duterte is popular in this country in that powerful stance. Philippine is needs to end purge soon and to unit by peaceful way. I hope Duterte should resign immediately after to do."
8081,"He killed too many people, however, we should not easily think he is a cruel person. Taking drugs and trading drugs must be punished. In Philippine, drug abuse has been social problem. We cannot help but say his way of punishment is a strong deterrent to crime. However, in addiction, the thing to which serious consideration and attention should be paid is the criminal's rights. They should be given a chance for rehabilitation. Depriving of the opportunity is not to be allowed. I think he should find any other solutions for that. Now, he has a great influence and attracts world's attention in the international community. We should keep watching his remark and action."
8082,"I was surprised when I first read this news. This is because the number of people who were killed in the drug war is very high and they were killed by Duterte, their own country's President. I think Duterte's way to keep the peace is not the best. I think other ways to keep the peace can be found."
8083,"I felt this is really hurtful news, when I read this. Of course, drug addicts often die by overdose, and it is very simple method to give state institutions the right to kill them and buyers. However, they also have human rights and there is no leeway for revival of their own efforts. In my opinion, Duterte abuses his power, and Philippine government will arouse antipathy."
8084,I think Duterte is very strong man. But his policy and his behavior is not humane. So I disagree with his opinions. But his thorough behavior should be emulated by many people.
8085,"Now, I'm a student studying law. So I know that sanctions and harsh attitude against crime. However his way is too violent. Why the drug has spread in the Philippines is not only a user but also a society that allows the drugs. I think he did should do it in a different way. For example, education reform. As in Japan, it is important to educate the horror of drugs from primary education."
8086,"All we think after we see the headline will be the one ' how crude president!!' or something like that. And I also thought almost same thing. But after I read this article, I understood why he is so popular. Drugs harms our society so strong. And his action to criminal is somewhat good."
8087,"I agree with Kern's opinion because multinational companies earn a lot of money and they should contribute to our society by paying taxes. If multinational companies are allowed to exploit low-tax regimes, the difference between rich and poor will increase and it is not good for the world's economy."
8088,I felt surprised to hear the news because the tax of general company is seldom recognized as a problem in Japan.Certainly the media in Japan broadcasts the news that the politicians didn't pay enough tax.But l seldom hear that the company didn't pay enough tax.So I feel this e difference of recognition about tax between in Japan and in America .
8089,"When I read this article , I was very surprised to know that multinational companies like Amazon and Starbucks pay less tax in Austria than one of the country's tiny sausage stands. It is absurd that small companies pay more taxes than big ones in Austria. I think Apple is clever too , so like Mr.Kern, I also praise the European Commission's ruling that Apple should pay up to €13bn in taxes plus interest to Ireland."
8090,"I think that the big companies should pay more taxes than small companies. However, it is not good to force countries to do so, because each countries should be left in their financial policies."
8091,"I thought it is a problem that Multinational companies including pay less tax in Austria than one of the country's tiny sausage stands. We should help the local companies than the multinational companies. In addition, I think that should keep even print media. So multinational companies should pay more tax."
8092,"I was surprised by this article because I had thought multinational companies paid much more tax than sausage stands. To be sure, R running a large scale company is very hard. However, if multinational companies continued paying low-tax, the gap between them and tiny sausage stands would expand. EU should research the recent conditions and sales of a lot of multinational companies and judge which companies are allowed to pay low tax."
8093,"I was surprised to hear this news. Normally we must pay reasonable taxes, but in case of this multinational companies do not pay reasonable taxes. I think multinational companies sell a lot of products all over the world, so multinational companies should have to pay taxes which commensurate with their sales."
8094,"I have already known this general problem, but I didn't think world-famous companies got around the law very boldly and massively such as Amazon, Starbucks, and so on. This may suggest the current tax system in the world is getting outdated. In fact, it was established more than about 20 years ago, though some revisions were added to it. So, it is unavoidable that an inconsistency came up between the reality and the system. After all, we can say the time has come when we have to settle this difficult problem seriously."
8095,"I don't agree with the idea of Duterte. To be sure, it is important to prevent people to use drugs. Moreover, death penalty will terrify drug users and the people who have not use drugs yet but are interested in using drugs, and it will lead to reduction of drugs in Philippine. However, I think killing all drug users is radical. Philippine government should adopt another idea in order to eradicate illegal drugs,"
8096,"It is important to all companies to make an effort to cut down on expenses and to make a more profit. However, it is against the rules to pay no taxes in spite of making a profit. If any companies do such things, economics systems will collapse. We must follow the rules. Multinational companies should pay taxes to all countries where they get a profit."
8097,"I think multinational companies should pay more taxes because they earn a lot of money all over the world. But it has a problem which is decrease in employments. The reason why I think so is that multinational companies set up their branches in the country where the taxes is low. If the taxes are increased, they won't set up their branches in the country. Then, the country's unemployment may be increase. Since it is bad too excessive taxation, we have to consider about this problem seriously."
8098,"I agree with Kern's opinion, multinational companies should pay more taxes. This is because multinational companies earn a lot of money all over the world and they should contribute to our society by paying taxes. In my opinion, the most problem is that small-scale country such as Ireland and the Netherlands stole tax of multinational companies by cooperating tax cheating. Therefore, multinational companies should pay more taxes."
8099,"I'm interested in this head line. 'Amazon and Starbucks 'pay less tax than a sausage stand' in Austria' I cannot understand what this mean. I have same opinion like Chancellor Christian Kern. Multinational companies should pay more taxes. I wonder the companies pay few taxes at some countries like Ireland, it may have bad influence at Austria."
8100,I was surprised to read the news. Because the multinational companies including Amazon and Starbucks pay less tax than one of the country's tiny sausage stands. So I agree with Kern's opinion and they should pay more tax than the small companies.
8101,"I had already known the news that Apple saved its corporate tax and other tax by establishing the head office in Ireland before I read this article. But I didn't recognize this fact that other multinational companies such as Google,Amazon,Starbucks have been taking the similar scheme. It is true that this plot isn't promoted publicly from the viewpoint of fairness. But it is not blameful immediately to do this thing because they don't break the law truly."
8102,"I was so surprised to read this story. I think this action is too strict and unmorality. Never allowed developed country. But this action may be effective. People are afraid government and decrease illegal drug trade. However, I think this idea is not good. So I hope Rodrigo Duterte will find good idea."
8103,"I like Starbucks and Amazon. They are very famous and huge company and everybody knows. I was surprised that every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation like Starbucks and Amazon. I think tax saving is one of business. So that tax saving is not illegal, I think it is okay. But if that is illegal, they must pay more tax."
8104,"I had never known this news. I often use Apple's product ,and I love and trust them. So when I heard this news first, I can't believe what happened. I think there is many people like me in the world, so I want Apple to pay specified taxes. And other multinational companies have many their fans also. I want them to acquit their obligations so that they fail a cut."
8105,"I think drug is bad for people,but killing is worse. So,Duterte shouldn't say such a thing again,and lack the credentials to be a president."
8106,"I was surprised when I read this article. Amazon and Starbucks are very famous multinational companies ,so i can't believe they pay less tax in Austria than one of the country's tiny sausage stands. I think they make a lot of profit from all over the world ,so they have to pay more tax which is appropriate for that earning."
8107,"I was surprised when I read through this article because I didn't know that those companies paid less tax than other firms in Austria. I strongly believe that those multinational companies such as Amazon and Starbucks should pay appropriate tax because, as Kern mentioned, if they paid more tax subsidies, print media could increase."
8108,"I was so surprised that Duterte kills a lot of people who use drugs.Of course , using drugs is a criminal act.But I think this is not worthy of a capital crime. I think he isn't worthy to take the lead because he kills blindly the people involved in drugs without taking their circumstances into consideration."
8109,"When I read this news title, I was so surprised. The multinational companies should pay more tax than small shops. The small shops cannot sell as much as the multinational companies because of the number of shops. I think the companies should pay tax according to their sales."
8110,"We can guess that the Philippines demand drug war, but we can also imagine that many Filipinos live in constant fear of death. We understand a lot of countries' criticism about his drug war, but we know that the nation have self-government too. However, I do not want to support his murder because I believe that authority must not kill people in principle. History shows that extrajudicial killings kill too many people who need not die. Because of many tragedies like Jew-baiting, we have been aiming to build the rule of law. In order to respect human rights, we have repeated one trial and error after another.Therefore I recommend him to reconsider his crackdown if the Philippines desire to walk with us, and not repeat history. Anyway even if the majority agree with his murder, I can not agree as a person."
8111,"When I read this article, I think it is terribly difficult problem. These troubles such as tax-haven are bad systems because these are unfair, but there are both people who make a profit and who suffer a loss by them. Globalization is advancing more, so I suppose that all countries and all companies have to discuss and decide about tax problems."
8112,"I was very shocked by heard this news. Because multinational companies such as Starbucks is considered to be made up by the trust in the various countries I thought. There are better to pay fair than to pay taxes by using loopholes in the law, this way is not to be such a problem, I think that it is also up company image. Therefore I agreed to Kern opinion. More and more globalization is being, more and more multinational companies increase, so I think countries should better to promote making law of tax for multinational companies."
8113,"I agree with your opinion. As with your opinion, I also could not believe it. I think that they have to pay more tax,too."
8114,"I was very surprised at this news,and agree with Kern's opinion. Because multinational companies earn a lot of money and they should contribute to our society by paying taxes by nature.If multinational companies don't pay payable tax,there will occur a widening gap between the rich and poor.It is not good for world economics,So I think we should provide some rules urged companies to pay payable tax. For example, making law is a very good idea because companies cannot resist."
8115,"I think that this problem should be solved by all countries. I understand most companies do not want to pay large amount of taxes and do a various ways to reduce taxes. However the way which Multinational companies do is unjust. So we should make new tax rules in order to correct this unjust. But if some countries do not cooperate, Multinational companies can escape from tax. Therefore all countries should participate in new rules."
8116,"I was very surprised about this news because I do not know about Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte's policy and this thing cannot happen in Japan. I know he is called Philippine Trump before I read this article but I was not interested in his policy. Surely it is difficult to eradicate drug trades, however his policy is very radical and crimes against humanity. I think most his actions are haphazard such as his remark about Obama and may spoil national interests. Therefore Philippine should change the president."
8117,"I think this issue is one of the most difficult matter to solve these days. There are two types of countries that they are welcoming huge companies for their economics and earn more taxes from large companies. For me, both ways are good for their benefit so that I cannot decide which is a right way. I hope every countries will sit the table of negotiation and they will try to find the nice answer for this issue."
8118,"I think killing people who involve in drugs is too strict. I have ever seen a statistic that show that death penalty won't decrease the number of crimes. Killing is immoral, so President should stop that and find some alternative measures."
8119,"I think tax should be paid equally, which means that the larger company should pay more tax. I don't know why the multiple companies aren't criticized more severely although a news of illegality about tax by politicians tends to be broadcast in a big way in Japan. Even if there is difference between global companies and Japanese politician, tax should be supervised more strictly in the term of disparity of wealth."
8120,"I was surprised to hear this news because multinational companies earn a lot of money and they should pay taxes more than other companies. I think companies should pay a lot of taxes, which earns a lot of money.Will be spread poverty of disparity when they were if as this news."
8121,"When I read this article, I was really surprised to know that President Rodrigo Duterte made a vow to kill tens of thousands of criminals in an unprecedented blitz to rid the country of illegal drugs in six months. Of course, I can understand a little why he is so popular domestically and his campaign is boosting his poll ratings. However, I think that killings should not be promoted, whatever reasons they are."
8122,"I often use Starbucks and Amazon. They are the huge companies everybody knows. I was surprised to hear the head line and its news.The head line means every sausage stand pays more tax in Austria than a multinational corporation like Starbucks and Amazon. Multinational companies pay few taxes.I think tax saving is one of their strategy in business. So, if tax saving is not illegal, I think it has no problem. But if that is illegal, they must pay more tax.It is for saving small shops from huge companies.The small shops cannot sell as much as the multinational companies because of the number of shops. I think the companies should pay tax according to their sales if they do illegal business."
8123,Multinational companies make significant sales and also provide us a lot of profits.This is a great achievement. But I think it is also important for large companies like these to build trust. I think they need to pay more taxes.
8124,I think this issue is very difficult . The idea that Multinational companies should pay more taxes because they earn a lot of money all over the world seems like the right thing. But it has the problem that inequality is born between the companies. I think we should make new tax rules that multinational companies convinced pay more tax.
8125,"I think this issue has a very difficult problem. Of course, I think multinational companies which earn a lot should pay as much taxes as sausage stands do. However, it looks unequal that those companies pay more taxes than these stands. I think it is difficult to choose which is more important, the relative equality or absolute equality."
8126,"It is very difficult problem, I reckon. Multinational companies like Amazon, Starbucks, or Apple achieve large sales, and they also have an obligation to pay taxes by that amount. However, when we capture this tax evasion as an idea to gain more profit, we cannot sweepingly say that it was a bad thing. What we need to reconsider, in my opinion, is the system of EU states with low-tax regimes that have lured multinationals."
8127,"This news was quite shocked me. Apple is one of the most successful multi-national companies today, and it has enormous influence in many countries. I really cannot understand how could they ingeniously pay such a small amount of taxes which is less than a sausage stand. I believe that the bigger company is, the bigger responsibility its has. I hope the problem of 'tax heaven' could be solved soon."
8128,"I was surprised to hear this news. However,I agree with Kern's opinion. those companies earn a lot of money. They afford to contribute to society. They should pay more taxes."
8129,"I feel the question at this news. I usually visit Starbucks, I have iPad and I feel Amazon's online shopping useful. As a user, I am grateful for their service. However they pays too little and they are almost criminal. On the other hand, I feel question at chancellor's comment about google and Facebook. He wanted to help traditional media but I think the internet must be the center of future. I will mark a this news like this."
8130,"I've heard this news before, and then I am surprised at it again. I think these big companies, such as Amazon and Starbucks should pay more taxes. Some people will continue to buy their products even after knowing this truth, but others will stop buying them. As a result, the companies' sales would decrease. No one can be happy with it. Thus, I believe all companies should pay taxes equally."
8131,"When I read this article,I think that the battle between America and Russia is similar to the Hammurabi Law.And it is useless to revenge against attack.Besise, the Russian way that uses scapegoat for big problems.because l think those are not solve for the problems."
8132,"I was surprised to Philippine situation. In Japan, even if drug users were arrested by police, they were not punishable by the death penalty. Though Duterte acts like a devil, he gains the support of 90% of the people. Filipino have a hunger to improve a bad circumstance. This mind become a driver of backing up to Duterte."
8133,"I think 'purpose of company' is that making more money within the law. Amazon and Starbucks action follow this purpose. In addition, they obey the law. If so, I think there is no problem. However, it is an absurd story that a large companies pay just as much tax as sausage stands."
8134,"I think tax's problem is too difficult and danger to talk my opinion about this problem. About tax, we have many problem to solve in Japan. For example, tax evasion is the most popular problem. Tax evasion is can't exposed by Regional taxation bureau, because of too many company which have concealed tax evasion. And such companies participate government. So we can't do anything for chaos of society. But I feel regret this fact."
8135,I was surprised by this article. I often use Starbucks and Amazon. So I agree Austria's opinion. I disagree to pay much tax. But I realize Austria's opinion too.
8136,"To be sure, doping should not be forgiven.However, players must be protected from leaking their privacy. I think the problem ought to be left to the 'sportsmanship' of the players."
8137,"Certainly, using drug or selling drug is wrong action, but I think the way Duterte took was not necessarily good. In other words, his conduct was too strict. Punishing people who use or sell drug is natural. Otherwise the weight of punishment should be considered well. Killing criminals is not only way to penalize. For example, in Japan, there are some facilities for drug criminals to rehabilitate and they can train. In brief, in Japanese system they don't have to be killed. They are qualified to live. Incidentally people selling drug are also killed in Japan. As described above, Duterte's way is too severe. He must be cursed. Doing everything how he wants to do is certainly feel good, but I think this action will affect adversely on their future."
8138,"I don't agree with the action of Russian hackers. To be sure, in the field of sports, all athletes must play fair, so it is not good to use restricted drugs. However, hacking is illegal. I I I don't think it is right to expose unfair practices by committing crimes."
8139,"Reading this article, I do not know whether US Olympic stars have taken restricted drugs or not. I think all players should follow the anti-doping rules. I hope no players will not violate them during the Tokyo Olympics."
8140,"Needless to say, leaking private information of athletes is never forgiven. But I think using drugs is as the serious problem as the leaking. Doping will make sports unequal, which means that sports won't be a competition anymore in my opinion. Even if the purpose of using drugs is therapeutic use, doping should be forbidden because such an exceptions will complicate the rule. All athletes must tackle the contention more sincerely."
8141,"It is true that doping is unacceptable habit, but I cannot support the hackers' action. In today's world, protection of personal information is one of the most important issues and we should not use others' personal information without permission for any reason. I think we should solve the doping problems by educating players."
8142,"I didn't know this news that top tennis players and Olympic medalist , Simone Biles was doubted about using restricted drugs. But, this rumor results from the leak by the Russian hackers. So I think it's necessary for the professional institution to investigate the details. And I suspect that there are no relations between this leak and the political conflict. It is true that Russia was feeling unpleasant about the prohibition of the entry of Russian athletes in Rio Olympic games. But Russian government could easily figure out that there are no good effects because it only causes the discord with the U.S."
8143,"I think Olympics should be held without using drugs. Such Olympics may be brought by a leak of personal information by a hacker until now . Even if a personal information leak makes the profit in Olympics, it may not always be profitable. In daily life, it is rather threatening. Our school founder Fukuzawa Yukichi said 'we can't be convenient without being inconvenient.' We need to follow the rules to become convenient."
8144,"I was shocked to hear this news and I think those who were doubted were really surprised and got nervous. I guess that it was a Russian revenge for the punishment for doping. Many Russian athletes cannot join in Rio Olympics, which will make them sad and nervous, but this is a right decision in the long run. The Olympics should be held fairly and the athletes should not cheat. By punishing them, they will never do doping and others feel it is a the worst thing. Then,the problem of Therapeutic Use Exemptions should be considered more seriously. This is a difficult problem. I support the therapeutic use exemption because its use may be a matter of life and death. As a conclusion, athletes should not do doping with just a purpose of winning."
8145,"Some media says many countries' athletes are secretly having anti-doping to achieve a better accomplishment. But more people believe they are just having those medicine for medical use. In any case, I don't think their private record should be open to all over the world. I reckon there must be a better solution to soft the relationship between America and Russia."
8146,"I was very surprised at this news. I think doping is not forgiven in the eyes of fairness of sports. It is problem that athletes use drug to improve their physical ability. But if the purpose is medical care, it may be acceptable. There is no big sense in blaming to Russian government for leaking star athletes' medical files. What is most important is to protect athletes' health because once they break their body, they perhaps can never play sports. Although there is a problem of privacy, if athletes don't have any guilty consciences, they had better to publish the data of their medical care by themselves. If the action is spread, no one will be able to reproach their medical file."
8147,"I think that a crackdown on illegal drugs should do, but it ought to be able to do in a different way. I think that a judiciary proceedings are very important, so Philippine should go back to being a country under the rule of law. There are some gang groups in Japan, but they are under control of the police. In a like way of Japan, Philippine government should do take control drug couriers and decrease them."
8148,Hacking and leaking privacy information are vicious crime. However doping is serious issue in the world of sports.Athletes should play fair each other.I hope that IOC pursue the truth.
8149,"Certainly,Doping is bad thing. However, I think that should not be leaked by the hacking. I think that violation should become apparent by the right way."
8150,"When I was read this article,I was very surprised. People usually want to hide their privacy information,especially medical history and criminal record.It is their important personal information and other people should not invasion.Certainly I think that doping is unacceptable,people should to find and regulate this offense. But hacking is unacceptable,too. I think people should use another way to find doping without hacking."
8151,I can not agree with Russian hackers.The Times reported the leak is regarded as a revenge cyber attack' by Russian hackers angry over the country's partial Olympic ban.It is the truth that the Russian athletes have taken illegal drugs for Rio Olympic in 2016 and it is proved by the official survey.It is obvious to be banned to participate in a sports competition that the country ignored the official rule.And the hack athletes' medical file by Russian hackers is unreasonable.
8152,"Needless to say, releasing confidential medical files of US Olympic stars including tennis players Venus and Serena Williams and teenage gymnast Simone Biles is not forgiven. Because it's personal data. These days, to protect that data is the most important things.For example, we have a lot of law to protect it. So the way which Russian hackers did is illegal. I can understand Russian must be angry about they was not able to participate many Rio Olympic event. Because of doping. But they must not insist their opinion by using illegal way. And also I wonder this accident give bad influence on athletes. I think games should be held fairly. I hope It will never happen again at 2020 Tokyo Olympic."
8153,I was surprised to hear the news. I think doping is bad thing because they should participate in Olympic. But I disagree with the Russian hackers' leak. It makes many athletes disappointed. I hope it won't be happened by next Olympic.
8154,"Actually doping should not be allowed, so we must keep to the regulations. Organizations have to protect both health and privacy of athletes from hackers or authorities. Meanwhile many athletes are related to each government, and there is a repeat of the spiral of hackers and security. I think we can not get rid of doping like Mr.Duterte does, so I believe that we can solve those problems if all people is a good person."
8155,"I guess it was a Russian revenge for the punishment for doping. Many Russian athletes cannot join in Rio Olympics, but this is a right decision in the long run. Actually doping should not be allowed, so we must keep to the regulations. Moreover, the Olympics should be held fairly and the athletes should not cheat. Organizations have to protect both health and privacy of athletes from hackers or authorities. I support the therapeutic use exemption because its use may be a matter of life and death. And, athletes should not do doping with just a purpose of winning"
8156,"I guess it was a Russian revenge for the punishment for doping. Many Russian athletes cannot join in Rio Olympics, but this is a right decision in the long run. Actually doping should not be allowed, so we must keep to the regulations. Moreover, the Olympics should be held fairly and the athletes should not cheat. Organizations have to protect both health and privacy of athletes from hackers or authorities. I support the therapeutic use exemption because its use may be a matter of life and death. And, athletes should not do doping with just a purpose of winning."
8157,"When I read the article, I came to be nervously wondering if my private medical records were the next to be made public. And I think especially athletes' medical records should be protected from hacking with great care because athletes' reputations are greatly depend on their integrates."
8158,"When I was reading this article, I was very surprised. That the athlete is a representative of each country have a doping.That Russian hackers have gone divulge personal information.I was very surprised that the two."
8160,"When I read this news, I thought the hackers should be punished. The leak of the star athletes' medical files taints athletes' honor and they will feel bad. If they really use drugs for medication, their bad image is spread to people without any crime. I think drugs in sport is a serious problem. The athletes who use drugs can play sports in good condition and that will lead them good score. In order to offer an equal situation, drugs in sports should be banned. However, I think supervising private medical details records is not good idea to control drug using because it will involve privacy problem. I would like to suggest that the group for example Wada should check athletes drugs using more strictly in order to avoid the accident like this news."
8161,"I was shocked when I heard this news. Confidential information like these medical files of US Olympic stars should have to store carefully, but in this case these dates leaked. So hacker should have to punish. On the other hand the US might well have to deal these dates more carefully."
8162,"I think that Russian computer hacker's action is dirty. Because Athlete's personal information can be seen by the general public. Most athletes(except athletes using illegal drugs without World Anti-Doping Agency's permission) are innocent. So they have a right that does not be known their personal information by other people. This action means aiming at citizen. Therefore, Russian computer hackers should be arrested."
8163,"I was surprised when I read this news, because it shouldn't be happened that the athletes ' medical data which was kept by the IOC wa leaked. The athletes credit to IOC and leave their privacy data. Therefore, this incident occurred means not only just bad news bud also it will effect the credit of the country."
8164,"I don't agree with the action of Russian hackers.Because hacking is illegal act. But all athletes must play fair in the field of sport, so it is not good to use restricted drugs. I think Olympics should be held without using drugs."
8165,"I felt it is not good thing bringing the terrible skirmish to the world of sports after I read this article. I believe that players can be honest if they have a strong mind to win the tournament. Of course WADA is a very important organization to punish some unfair athletes. However if some countries bring political issues to sports, I cannot stand with them and don't support them."
8166,"I didn't surprise to hear this news ,because I've known Russia which use doping drug and released confidential medical files. This news is bad for Russia, I anticipate that everyone think just not 'Russia is a drag country' when they hear it in addition 'All players of Russia has a tweet.' The hacker's behave is to pour oil on fire which is our label for Russia. I think Russia should eradicate of doping for fair management of Olympics and a lot of sporting events."
8167,"Reading this article, I thought we should consider how important the personal information is. The thing the Russian hackers did is unacceptable even if the athlete had done doping, much more the athlete didn't. Russian hackers might have wanted to remove the stigma of 'drug-nation' Russia, however it seems to be counterproductive."
8168,"I knew that the Russian athletes couldn't join the Olympic. However I didn't know this news about Russian hackers. I think this is a terrible news. It doesn't matter whether it's true or not, the problem is that online news like this seems to be true. Because the online information spreads quickly and this is a powerful media that a lot of eyes on. Especially the word 'hacking' have a reality. Now I have no idea what to do if I'm leaked false information."
8169,"Needless to say, all the sports players should be fair and they should not use drugs. However, their private medical certificate need to be protected as other people. Therefore, based on the assumption that their privacy should be protected, we ought to seek a solution to make the sports game fair. Also, I don't support the way of Russian hackers. Their action is illegal. It is not allowed for any opinion expression to be against a law."
8170,"Surely if people need drugs to compete, like asthma where an astonishing 70% of the British swimming squad have and isn't just limited to the UK, they should participate in the Paralympics,I think. Otherwise what will happen is that dodgy doctors will give 'exemptions' and everyone will take drugs 'legally'. Personally I feel there is too fine a line between legal medications and illegal ones, and therefore am totally disinterested in the Olympics."
8171,"It is very difficult to say good or bad to this problem. In my opinion,leaking private information of athlete is an offense. However, from the point of view of fairness of sports,doping is so bad thing. So, we should take a dope test more strictly."
8172,"There are many different thinking and many different people in the world. It is very good things. People must accept such the various ideas. If they can do so, this conflict about burkini will also calm down."
8173,"I have mistaken burkini for a kind of bikini, but I noticed my misunderstanding today. Burkini is a special swimsuit designed for Muslim women. I don't think that burkini affects public order and I think wearing burkini should not be banned. People have freedom of belief and they also have right to behave following the rules of their religion."
8174,"If the athletes took prohibited drugs, the act of the hacker is meaningful job. However, in this instance, WADA should discover the doping of athletes. In this article, they didn't take restricted drugs. So, the hacker's action is to invade his/her privacy. It should not be permitted."
8175,"This news is too terrible, because I can't believe that large companies for example Amazon or Starbucks had paid lower tax than sausage stand paid. As long as we live in present day, we should follow the rules. That is to say, we should pay tax. But I know that obeying rules is so difficult. In japan for example, there are a lot of tax evasion or delinquency of tax. Certainly, avoiding to pay tax gives money to companies. But considering the loss of discovering a set of these actions, I think paying tax properly is best way for the company. Tax imposing to us corresponds own. It is true that much tax imposes on lager companies and this is equal. I hope them operate sincerely."
8176,"I so agree with Alshelh. Muslim women have rights to wear Burkini. Muslim women wear Burkini is like we wear bikini. Each region has each culture. No one can ban it. For example, Article 20, the Constitution of Japan guarantees freedom of religion is guaranteed to all. No religious organization shall receive any privileges from the State, nor exercise any political authority. I'm disappointed at France. I thought France is symbol of freedom. But now, I wonder does France has a law to protect human rights. I don't know why they want to ban to wear Burkini without any convincing argument. I also follow update of this story and find the picture which French police force her to take off her Burkini. I'm so shocked by that. It's violation of human rights. I hope one day all Muslim women can go French beach without any concern."
8177,I think that the main problem between burkini and Islamic terrorism is public welfare.Thefore the liberty to wear on clothes you like fight against the restrictions to protect people from threat of Islamic terro.So it is difficult to judge which is correct and the judge depends on you.
8178,"Some people say that banning women covering up at the beach solves nothing and is simply religious based harassment. However, in my opinion, it is about fear. France has had more terrorist attacks than many European nations. Those attacks have been by people who reject western values. Burkini is very visible symbols of the rejection of western values. In every country, burkini is seen as symbols of the subjugation of women. Maybe when a woman decides to choose to wear burkini, she should take into some consideration the customs and values of the country she is in as the one making this decision."
8179,"I agree with Alshelh opinion. Muslim woman mast not show their skins. So if it were not for burkini, Muslim women can not swim in the sea and pool. It give Muslim women freedom of swimming any where. So a ban of burkini is big problem for not only Muslim women but also every people over the world."
8180,I think the local authorities shouldn't ban the burkini because Muslim women doesn't do the bad thing in reality and does not break the law. The attempt of local authorities to deport the Australian Muslim woman from France is a invalid action. It is true that that some people associate the burkini with terrorism. But that is a prejudice to Islamism and Islamic women. I think French authorities would rather respect Islamic cultures than exclude them.
8181,"As written in this article, there should not be a connection between terrorism and the burkini, and also there should not be a connection between terrorism and Islam. Originally, Islam is not a dangerous religion. Some Islamic extremists cause terrorism and most of Muslim are peaceful, so we should not have prejudice about them. Next, they have the right to wear freely what they want to wear. Wearing the burkini should not be banned. If it is banned, Islamic women cannot swim in the sea, which is relevant to human rights. Now, all Islamic people have difficulty living all around the world, especially in Europe, because of ISIS, so it is important for us to understand them well and live with them cooperatively."
8182,"Almost all Muslims are harmless. We should not associate them with terrorism caused by a part of Muslims. So, whether Muslim woman wear burkini on the beach or not, people had better not be too sensitive about the swimwear because it is natural for Muslim women to cover their skins. I felt that it is difficult for many people to accept the culture though burkini ban is overturned. However, I think people must respect for other's religion each other."
8183,"I was unexpected that Trump be a American president. Both of presidential candidate have a lot of problem. But Trump's speech was too violent. I have thought he is great entrepreneur but not proper to be a president. However after I read this article, I can understand little why he was elected. I know he is not silly and he is clever. So I hope Trump be a great president and 'Make America Great Again!' Many people is doing a demonstration because they cannot accept Trump be an American leader. U.S.A. is more deeply divided.The most important is 'We are all Americans' I also feel this presidential election is similar to British referendum. No one can anticipate. In this election, I'm particularly impressed by Clinton's speech. 'To all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me, I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion. I know that we still have not shattered that highest glass ceiling. But some day someone will-hopefully sooner than we might think right now. And to all the little girls watching right now, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world.' By this speech, I suppose I want to be the person who can shattered 'glass ceiling'.Clinton gave me an incentive to challenge."
8184,I think Muslims are around to wear Burkini at French beach. All people have a right to believe what they want and should have freedom to wear what they like. Therefore discriminations happened at French beach is illegal and against human rights. However recently terrorism took place in France. So Muslims should also self control not to wear Burkini at the public.
8185,I agree with Alshelh. Because there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether as she said. So I think burkini shouldn't be banned. And I hope the woman wear burkini at the beach freely.
8186,"If the person who put on the burkini appears at that beach, I wouldn't care about her. I think that's because I live in Japan where we haven't suffered damage of terrorism directly. If I were local people, I may let her leave there. Of course all people have right to swim. We can't deny it and tell not to put on burkini here, because we can't prove that there are connection between terrorism and burkini. However I think right to life of local people should be allowed. Each right must not block others. Everyone would have to consider the way in which both rights can exist at the same time."
8187,"I feel danger about American's election result. Because present America seems like former America in WWⅡ.At that time , the thought that is antisemitism that is the intense dislike for and prejudice against Jewish people in america.In those days, Americans thought the cause of the difficulty of finding employment is that many Jewish worked in america.In the way, Americans pegged the blame on Jewish , which caused tragic accident.Therfore Trump's speech, preclude immigrants seems to antisemitism.I have no idea what Trump will do , I think it is important to judge what is exactly individually."
8188,"Eventually, Trump was elected as the new president. At first, I had never imagined Trump would win. However, many people said on TV that they supported him and they expected a person who could change the U.S., so I was feeling that it might be possible that he could win. Admittedly, he may change the country, but it may not be a good one. He is saying that he will not follow the Obama's policy, which made the U.S. comfortable for many peoples to live together, so they will have a difficulty staying in the country. This result would also do damage to Japan, such as the lapse of TPP. Not only the U.S. but the world will change. Now is the turning point in history. To tell the truth, I am afraid of this affair, and I do not think Trump deserves to be President. He should look at things from more different ways. He should consider more people' ideas and feelings. I hope the U.S. will be the country which, for all people, is comfortable and in which all of the people can realize the American dreams."
8189,"First, I didn't know this swimwear 'burkini' so I'm surprised. Second I think that in France, the burkini ban is collect. Because of saving Islam women and reassuring the French people. France is a country who is attacked by Islamic countries and there are a lot of people killed by them. After the terrorism, a lot of French people ware very angry. On the other hand, they feel afraid for Isis too. If there are the big difference between Isis and Islam, many people think the Islam not good. So the burkini indicating myself as Muslim is too dangerous to wear. And for the French, burkini might make them afraid."
8190,"I wonder French react so much to Muslims, while almost all Muslims are harmless. It is just official reason that Burkini is 'enslavement of women,' I think. This is because almost all women who wearing Burkini aren't forced to wear by men, according to an sociologist. Therefor I don't agree that women who wearing Burkini are prohibited."
8191,"I think this ban of the burkini is the discrimination against Muslims.But people in Europe have a greater sense of crisis for ISIS than in Japan.So I cannot say ,' Local people should take Muslims into the circle.'They have no choice but to feel anxious about them."
8192,"I felt sad read this article first. Because ,I think people all over the world respect other cultures and religions.If people deepen understanding about Muslim, it was not occur such unhappy thing and feel good for each other.Nowadays,terrorism took place in Europe and Muslims have bad influence.So it is difficult to stick to Muslims religious 'Burkini'."
8193,"I was surprised that Trump won. I believed that Clinton must win. I think Trump's human nature is defective.He said discriminatory remarks against immigration, Muslim and women. These remarks ought not to be allowed and he not suitable for President. After this election,I often hear that Obama was great .However I had heard criticism of Obama's cowardly attitude before Trump won.I can understand Americans were not satisfied with stagnant society and hope changes.But I feel this selection of American is too selfish. I hope that world peace will continue."
8194,"I oppose chasing off a woman in Burkini from the beach. Muslim women have rights to wear Burkini. We must give women freedom. Especially, I think threats are not good."
8195,"Religion does not have much influence on the lives of the Japanese people. However, in many countries and regions around the world religion is the basis of living.I think that it is very difficult to live in that country."
8196,"All of the French resorts should abolish the ban of wearing burkini. Some French people may be convinced that burkini is the symbol of enslavement of women and has a connection with terrorism and massacre. However, it doesn't have the basis, nor I don't think banning wearing burkini leads to the prevention of danger, such as terrorism. Everyone has human rights to have his own belief. Unless someone's belief threatens public order by danger, all of the cultures and actions from religions should be accepted. I hope Muslim women can express their freedom anywhere by wearing burkinis."
8197,"I was surprised at this news. I understand there are various thoughts about religions, however, it is hard to imagine that official workers such as police have done such a thing. We, Japanese, should think deeply again about religious issues because many of us have no religion."
8198,"I was really surprised at this news and couldn't believe at all. US is the biggest(having power) nation in the world, and this election has effect not only for US but also for all around the world. I believed that the world will be badly confused when Trump became US president. However, it could be too fast to think so, though the world was confused to some extent. I want to see carefully what is happening now and will happen in the future."
8199,"I made out that Trump is supported not by many people but by enthusiastic people. Complaints made people blind, and Trump used that, made people enthusiastic, and enthusiasm made people more blind. People should take advantage of this reflection at the next election."
8200,I felt it is not good thing to ban all burkini because if there are crimes by Muslims it is not mean all Muslims are bad. Burkini ban doesn't work for safe it is only made more hate and difficult for Muslims to live in their society. They should think about Muslims again and have communication with them.
8201,"When I read this article, I was sad to know Burkini-clad Australian woman chased off French beach. Not all Muslim people are dangerous like radicalized people in Islamic State. Off course, there were some attacks by terrorists in France these days, so I can understand why French people are severe with Muslims. However I think that , as is said in the article, 'There shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether.'"
8202,"t was a bit surprising news that Trump won the election, however it is also the result of democracy. The U.S. is a democratic country, so that their people need to accept that result. I heard that some of people who cannot accept the election have done terrible crimes but it is same thing as Fascist that protesters really hate."
8203,"I think it is not good to ban burkinis. French people are sensitive to ISIS after the terrorism broke, but all Muslims are not dangerous. French people shouldn't connect burkini to terrorism. Muslim women have rights to choose clothes they want to wear. We should respect their rights."
8204,"I was also paying attention to the US presidential election. So,I was surprised that Trump won. Public opinion was also annoyed with Trump 's fears. I can not expect positive credit for Trump. But I am paying attention to Mr. Trump who talks about changing the present situation."
8205,"I think that it is inequitable system and I support European commission's ruling. Multinational companies make more money than private shops, so multinational companies should pay more taxes than private shops. Certainly, they comply with law, but it would be widened the economic gap between poor people and rich people. But on the other hand, small nations have to earn foreign currency in such a way as to reduce corporation taxes. I think that it is very difficult problem."
8206,"I was surprised to hear the news because I though Clinton would win the election, certainly. I can't trust Trump because of his actions such as criticizing Obama and saving Japan. He changed the attitudes or thoughts after becoming an American president. But I think Trump is clever. So I hope he will change America and make it better."
8207,"I think that we should stamp out doping for a fair play, and we should impose severe punishment to doping. A state sponsored doping is the worst way. We have to observe rule. If this hack is reprisal and insist on Russian government, it is natural that WADA's ruling suspending from competition."
8208,"I think the result of this election show the state of American people. Nowadays, most citizens are afraid of the threat of terrorism and have frustration for their lives. However the people who insist the dissatisfaction to the immigrants or non-American people must be called racists. Trump's opinion is too extreme. However he is a spokesman for American oppressed people. The reason why few people expected Trump's win is the huge number of people who have discontent but insist it openly. In short, the number of people who wanted to have change their lives settled the election."
8209,"I think it is kind of discrimination against Muslim women to ban burkini. Recently there were many ISIS attacks and many people fear Muslims. The only Muslim extremists plan those attacks .However,people stat to have negative images to Muslims even though not all Muslims are violated and dangerous. That is because he media can make people to have image about what TV said and they can control people's feelings ,so the media have to broadcast news about Muslims more carefully. People need to have the wealth of knowledge about it ,.To ban burkinis in French is not fair. All people have rights to wear whatever they want."
8210,I think most people thought performance-enhancing drugs were banned without exception. Now we know that some athletes have a legal edge over others. I think the sports press should have made this clear before this hack.
8211,"Recently there is a problem about privacy protection, and leaking individual private information is regarded as a serious fault. So the action by Russian hackers should be forgiven. However, in my opinion, taking restricted drug is more serious and unacceptable problem because such drug will make sports unequally. If an athlete who takes restricted drugs beats an athlete who is far from violation, an effort of the latter would become waste of time. It is an insult for sports and sports will make no sense. As for the article's problem, the regulation of therapeutic use exemptions should be more clear. I myself belong to club and play baseball, so I hope that sports are equal."
8212,I was surprised at this result of the election. I think people voted to Trump not because some of them agreed to his speech but because they felt distrust of Clinton. It is difficult for me to think the president who won by that negative votes can improve America. I will be following update of his actions.
8213,"I am conflicted about the Burkini. On the one hand it is symbolic of oppression, on the other hand it allows women who want/must wear it to exercise, play with their kids, relax in the sea or pool. Did they just have to watch all the fun and splashing about before it's invention?"
8214,"I was very sad to hear this news , because burkini is breakthrough idea to break old concept of Islam for Muslim woman. Deterioration in security due to influx of repeated terrorism and immigration happen in France, so French hates Muslims. Now, world divided between ethnic groups, this is typical example. Some people have a prejudice against Muslims , But there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether,' I think too. We should"
8215,"I didn't think Trump became a president. It isn't because I sympathized with Clinton's policy, and she'd be suitable for a president. It's because I knew Trump's radical remark and he was not politician until he became president. American people hoped that they will take completely different ways and chose him who had a slogan of 'Make America Great Again'. Now that he became a president. Japan may feel anxiety at the thought of American policy on protectionism, but I want Japan will be flexible with change without losing sight of its basic policy."
8216,"Many people consider Trump to be a pragmatist; seeing a problem and trying the best solution to a problem. Sure, that approach is never guaranteed, but what approach is? He's had four bankruptcies in his projects, but those projects number in the hundreds, at least. But, a larger picture raises a larger question. Millennials, who fancy themselves as pragmatic, take a look at the entire field, both parties, and see the same old, and probably think that there are no new solutions coming from tired old ideas and politicians. Any lasting, worthy, noble ideas almost always come from across the aisle agreements; Clinton-Gingrich welfare reform, Reagan- O'Neil budget/tax agreement, things like that. Current Washington sentiment isn't getting us to that place. And please, don't point to Obamacare as a noble solution- at best a current work in progress. So many people, a surprising amount, look to both Trump and Sanders as a new option, untested politically, with new ideas, new campaigns, and a new way of doing just about everything. Which to a lot of people, is more attractive than the old way of doing things."
8217,"In fact, he was elected US President, They ought to support his policies. Now his extremist statements focused on people, but in fact he was President he is than his remarks that the country give top priority to responsibility. So, don't have bad policies, not or."
8218,"Everyone has their rights to choose what to wear. We should respect their culture and religion. We show respect to others, and receive respect from others. Of course, there must have some sensitive reasons about these behave by French. But Muslim don't equal to terrorist."
8219,"i was very surprise to the result about the election of the US president. And after reading the news, I becoming to realize the reason about the result. To be honest, I don't think trump is worth to be a president. He is extreme, rude and old fashioned. A country should be connected to other countries,should be global to become stronger, nowadays. However, the result is Trump. The America people select Trump, so i will accept it and except the America move in future."
8220,"As Zeynab Alshelh mentioned, I strongly believe that there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether. Considering the fact that burkinis were originally made to allow more Muslim women to take part in swimming and other sports, and to give them freedom, I'm sure that no one can take it away from them."
8221,"In fact, I thought Trump could be the next American president, because according to some medias, there are a lot of people are the ' silent assistant for Trump'. They cannot openly say they support Trump in that Trump's some shocking speeches. But instead of Clinton, Trump seems like know better what the Americans really want. Also the Trump's triumph may mean the TPP will not be able to take effect any more. In my point of view, it is may be a good news for Japan. Whatever, I am expecting new president Trump brings us many surprises."
8222,"I was surprised by this news, because I think everyone should wear clothes that they want to wear and restricting wearing is abnormal. I do not think wearing burkini equal to terrorism. People who want to protect their skin from sunlight may wear burkini. When I read this news and looked at the two cartoons on the lesson materials, I thought regions restriction is very strict. However, people who believe in their region have to follow the region's rule, so we should accept their action and should not have bias to their restriction. I was very sympathised with the message that ' there should not be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there should not be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether.' People should be more acceptable to others' region, thinking and live in peace."
8223,We have the right to wear whatever clothing we like. So I think Muslim women can wear Burkini. We have to understand different cultures and live together. Don't hate strangers and don't think like Trump. We are citizens of the mother earth.
8224,"First of all, we have to accept the result because just complaining about the result won't make any progresses. Second of all, we should try to get along, move forward, and be proactive because whether we like it or not, the president for the next four years of the USA is Donald Trump."
8225,"I don't support the new U.S. president, Trump. At first, most of people around the world would not imagine the result of the election. However, eventually, he was elected as the American president. I think there are two problem. Of course, firstly, it is the danger that world peace and international order will be endangered. Secondly, the result showed American society is severely separated. This is the historically big problem of the country. If possible, I hope the new president carry out the policy for all the American."
8226,"I was so surprised to know that Trump won the election because he is very radical. I think people will require change like revolution for America. On the contrast to our concerns, his attitude after he won the election is calm. I want to follow the news that report Trump and other countries' relationship. I cannot imagine how he lead America and the world."
8227,"I was very surprised when I heard this news and I feel uneasy. Trump does radical and offensive insistence. For example , he said that he will build a wall on the Mexico border. I hope he will become a good leader and he does not bring chaos to the world."
8228,"It is very difficult problem to solve. There are a lot of people thinking variously in the world. However, in my opinion,the local authorities should not ban the burkini because they do not break the law. French authorities should respect Islamic culture."
8229,"I was surprised that Donald Trump elected as president of US. A lot of people over the world think Trump will lose this election and Clinton elected as a president of the united state before the election. But Trump finally won. Trump is not a politician, so his political have anxiety. Many people said he can't governed the US. I think so too. But he have managed many businesses. So I think his economic policy may be promising."
8230,"Everyone says that Trump is dangerous or something like that. I can agree with that for some degree, but I think it is not so hard as we expect. Why Trump was elected was, I think, because there are so many discontents in society of the USA. People needed changes and expected Trump to bring their lives restorations. I hope that the entire world will be as peaceful as it is now."
8231,"I was surprised to read this news. In Japan,it is ordinary to put on a burkini. So I couldn't think this problem.And I agree with the woman who was wearing a burkini. I could agree her the comment 'There shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether,' I think everyone may put everything on . So I was surprised to this news."
8232,"This is the latest result I have expected that Trump won the election. Certainly, Trump is one of the greatest businessman and he is also a charismatic person. He is supported by many working-class white voters. So, I don't think Trump is completely bad, but he is not suitable for president since he has used a lot of improper languages during his campaign. In addition, his statement which is about discrimination against women, making wall to reject entering illegal immigrants and so on has been evoking a lot of controversy. All over the world will come under the influence of this election results. For example, Japan has serious problem that is concerned with the Japan-US Security Treaty. This Treaty plays a big role of Japan's safety. I want that he become the man who is suitable president and he make America great again in the real sense."
8233,"I think a ban on wearing a burkini was appropriate. Surely we have the right to choose what kind of clothes we wear because we have a freedom of expression. But we ought to obey the local rule when we are in a particular region as the proverb,'When in Rome, do as the Roman do.' shows. The article's problem is seemed to be caused by a difference of religions and thoughts. I cannot imagine how important for Muslim women a wearing is because we Japanese tend to be irreligious, so I cannot find a correct solution for the problem. But in my opinion, a local rule should be given priority than a religious expression."
8234,"I was surprised at this news, but the result of US election may represents American people's true feeling.They want to go back to the golden age of America when white people dominated the US society and America was the only super power in the world. However I think their desires cannot go along with current world's situation. We have to accept immigrants and stop discrimination. All in all, it can be said that decision by majority is not always correct. Maybe we have to rethink about the way of democratic politics."
8235,"I agree with her. As she said, there shouldn't be a connection between Muslims and terrorism. However, terrorism is very danger, too many people were cruelly killed around the world. To prevent such a terrible cases, and to keep the order there, the physical checkup is unavoidable. It must not intend for Islam, and any religion."
8236,"I could not expect that Trump became the successor because his remark was always extreme and made people feel bad. Especially as for Japan, he complained about many things, such as TPP and US military base in Japan. I've ever heard that Japanese economy will deteriorate and our finding employment will become hard. Thus, there seems to be more disadvantage by an inauguration of Trump than one of Clinton. But now Trump has became a president. That unexpected result must have some reasons, and I investigated. There are two major reasons why Trump won, which are a trade and immigrations. Mainstream candidates tended to claim a policy which was advantageous for other countries but disadvantageous for US, but Trump has continued to claim a policy which is advantageous for US, such as abolition of TPP and rejection of immigrations. Such a factor made him won."
8237,"When I read this news, I was shocked .I cannot agree to Duterte. Surely, it is important to prevent people to use drugs. But every kind of person even the person who use drugs is important. II think you are never supposed to kill. Were there more other ways to help them. Such way is too cruel. Philippine government should adopt another idea to make 'narco-state'."
8238,I agree with Kern's opinion. I cannot understand the reason why such multinational companies like Starbucks and Amazon is paying a less tax. Starbucks and Amazon earn money. I think they should pay more tax
8239,"I thought it was possible for Trump to win the election to some extent. It is suspect whether he can carry out his manifesto or not. But this result is the expectation of US electorate who want the change of society. And Clinton couldn't change the image that she is the one of the typical 'establishments'. Even if her scandal turned out untrue, it would make her supporters disappointed. It's true that so many people are concerning about Trump's administration, but all we can do now is oversee his political sense."
8240,"I was not surprised the presidential election results, because I forecasted 'Trump will win' Why I forecast it that Trump has enthusiastic supporters and a lot of people does not express support Trump but they elected Trump. Clinton made manifest which is practical policy , in contrast, Trump made manifest that is too innovative and high-impact policy. Trump's said is racial discrimination, so this election result may make and promote racial gap. But in the other hand, he is expert of economy and business, so I expect his economic policies and diplomacy."
8241,"Surely, Islam is not a dangerous religion.And there should not be a connection between terrorism and the burkini, and also there should not be a connection between terrorism and Islam. Most of Muslim are peaceful, so we should not have prejudice about them. And they have the right to wear freely what they want to wear. Wearing the burkini should not be banned. If it is banned, Islamic women cannot swim in the sea, which is relevant to human rights. Now, all Islamic people have difficulty living all around the world, especially in Europe, because of ISIS, so it is important for us to understand them well and live with them cooperatively."
8242,"Actually, I didn't know about United States presidential election. But the elected day ,most TV programs were broadcasting about that because the result was unexpected. My father told to me that the winner will be Hillary Rodham Clinton. Many people as well as my father would think so. I watched one TV program that the people who were supporting Donald Trump were interviewed. They said 'I told to you because you are Japanese. If I said that I support Donald Trump, I'd be killed. So I never say that things.' When I watched that,I thought the pressure of the supporters of Hillary Rodham Clinton. And this is the reason why the result which isn't believed has happened. But I really worry about Japanese politics and economy. The most things I'm afraid is the change of the law that Japan also participates in a war. I never want to permit such law. I think I want Japanese Government not to lose the pressure of the United States."
8243,"Duterte took very hard actions for narcotics traders, but I think they had it coming. Drugs make us going bad as human and spreading drug must be eliminated from any countries. His way should not be admired, but it is necessary for the elimination of drug trade to impose the maximum penalty on occasion, I think."
8244,"Doping is unfair to other athletes so that it should be prevented. In my opinion, Russian government's behavior is not the perfect action to doping the problem. But it maybe made a good effect to every athlete."
8245,"Since terrorism, we are apt to hate the Islamic. Maybe the world is going exclusion-ism. Hearing some news, we can guess that many people regret globalization. Fortunately I am not a victim of terrorism or globalization, so probably I can not go into the feelings of people. Maybe I should not say 'All people can live in harmony.' easily. However, I say I believe. To give our children peaceful world, we can unite. To achieve our freedom, we must listen to reason. I know that France parades this famous slogan since the French Revolution, 'Liberty Equality Fraternity'."
8246,"I think the result that Trump was elected in America president election dangerous.He is known as a racist and criticize Muslim people no matter how no crime they have.He is full of prejudice and hate the immigrants in U.S.A. These days, U.S.A. is in serious situation of high-unemployment-rate, and people think it an uneasy about the future.Trump have known that people are dissatisfied about present situation and he had appealed that he can absolutely change it. So, he was good at controlling minds of people. I hope Americans not to be deceived and keen an eye on things Trumps will do and judge him exactly."
8247,"I was very surprised to know that Trump won the election. That's because many people around me said, Hillary Clinton would win the election, and I thought she would win, too. However, the result is difficult. I am wondering why he won the election. Off course, as is said in the article, to his supporters, Trump is seen as the strong leader who gets things done, but to me, he is too radical. I'm going to continue to check affairs of America."
8248,I think so.The way of hackers is meanness.
8249,I agree with you. I think Duterte should stop killings and find some alternative measures too.
8250,"I agree with you. I think he may change the country, but it may not be a good one,too. I do not think Trump deserves to be President."
8251,I agree with you. The only Muslim extremists plan those attacks .Surely not all Muslims are dangerous.But I also had a negative impression on all Muslims. I also wanted to be careful.
8252,I am also your opinion. Doping should not be forgiven. I think the idea of ​​sportsmanship is wonderful.
8253,First I was surprised that there are too many people involved with drugs in the Philippines. I think it is necessary to control drugs. But I think that you should choose the way.
8254,"I agree with you. It is painful to think that innocent people were also punished. I think that we should consider another method,too."
8255,"I have ever heard this news before on TV and I thought this system is interesting. But what I concerned about the most is how to prevent stealing. I don't know about the detailed system, but it seems to be difficult to prevent stealing without people. However as a customer, I am glad to be able to save the time to line up at a resister."
8256,"I thought exactly the same thing. I knew the news on TV and I wonder that there will be some stealing. However I don't know the specific system, I think without people's eyes is not good for restrain people from committing crimes. In addition, I also thought that this system will decrease people's communication. These days, people, especially in city, is said that have to take more communication. This Amazon Go system is interesting and maybe good for saving time and costs, however I don't think it is good."
8257,"I think that we should think which is better human or machine.Certainly,machine that is up to date can do various thing that help human.And in ageing society with fewer children ,that is more necessary.But all things shouldn't be depended on machine.Because I think there is something that human do better than machine.Therefore I think that we should decide which is better to depend on machine or to do by human."
8258,"I agree with Ford. I think that technology destroys more jobs than it creates and we can't stop it. Then if robots can do everything, what do we demand for humans? I think we demand warmth for humans. Even robots which have the same temperature with humans won't have the same warmth with humans. There are the things which only humans can do."
8259,I know 'Amazon Go' I thought their concept is only to save money and shoppers time. So I was surprised when I knew the real reason that is to cut costs and increase profits for corporation. I think the idea is good because I often think the price of goods becomes high by a cause of the personnel expenses. So I'd like to open Amazon's store in Japan. Surely Human's jobs lose. But there are some jobs that only man can do. So I feel it is good to grow automation.
8260,"I was very surprised to hear that you can buy goods without cash and you don't have to line up. There are no register clerks in the shop. It is true that this is not only convenient but dangerous. But I think the remark of the expert is pointless. Firstly, though this Amazon's new plan has begun just recently and no bad results has occurred yet , you shouldn't decided that it destructs jobs especially. Secondly, the criticism can't solve the fundamental problem of job loss. We have to devise the new solution for the human and the machine to live together."
8261,"I don't agree to Russian hackers. I think it is not good to use restricted drugs. All athletes should fight equally. But the things he did was not good. To be sure, using restricted drugs is bad. However,I wonder if there were other ways of exposing unfair practices. And one news came into my mind. Recently there is a problem about privacy protection like Unauthorized access to celebrity's mobile phone. I think the government should improve more to protect personal information."
8262,"'Amazon Go' is amazing system I feel. It has no registers. Instead, shoppers scan into the store with their free Amazon Go app, shop as normal, and leave the store with the items billed to their Amazon.com account. This system can save our money and time. But I didn't find the demerit. The demerit is Amazon Go needn't employ labors, so they can save cost. Instead of clerk, they use robot. I have heard many people say robot is threat for human. It's true. Japan have many labors too. I know Amazon Go is great. However I don't want it to come Japan. For labors."
8263,I think this is a new idea. It is very interesting. But I say that I do not have much effect. Because I think it is necessary to have a guardian. But I think that it will be good for consumers if the cost becomes lower.
8264,"I hope it won't be happened in Tokyo Olympic. And doping is bad, but this is not illegally medicine. So Russian hacker's should not leak. It violate privacy."
8265,"I agree with you. After this accident in 2012, North Korea launched rockets many times. Fortunately, there were no victims in that time too. But it may succeed next time and we don't know when to launch.North Korea is diplomatic and it is difficult to discuss accurately. So It is so serious problem, I think."
8266,"I could be convinced your impressions. But I thought of an opinion when I read your opinion. To be sure, our life will be more comfortable and the number of car accidents and traffic fatalities will decrease by developing of autonomous. However, I wonder if the development of autonomous will be really succeed. I think the judgement ability of the man is greater than robots . May we trust them really? I hope there will no accident by self-driving."
8267,"I agree with you. Like you, I think multinational companies earn a lot of money, so they should contribute to our society by paying taxes. If they do so, the world's economy will be better."
8268,"I agree with you. Off course, many Russian athletes cannot join Rio Olympic and that may make them sad and angry, but in my opinion, Olympics should be held fairly and all players should follow the anti-doping rules."
8269,"I agree with you. I think that it is a kind of discrimination against Muslim women to ban burkini, too. Not all Muslim people are dangerous but people begin to think 'Muslim' people are dangerous by watching TV. Like you , I think media should broadcast news more carefully."
8270,"I don't agree with the Amazon's new concept. To be sure, it is good to enable customers not to spend time to stand in a line by new scientific technology. However, it will lead to the rise of rate of unemployment. Reducing labor costs is important for big companies such as Amazon, but I think it will expand an economic gap among people. Moreover, relying on scientific technology so much will lead to lost of original abilities of human. Actually, I heard that modern children are more poor athletes than children in old days. Therefore, Amazon don't have to introduce the new shopping system."
8271,"According to this articles, technology are beginning to think. Technology which have higher capacity to process information than human also has thinking, human may be controlled by technology. This is a matter we should consider as well as lost our work by artificial intelligence. Now I suppose that human isn't controlled by artificial intelligence is an ideal. And I think that we don't control the artificial, rather than we should exist together. That is, we should find the thing only human can. I think 'a living body' is the most important. For example when suffering from something, we don't want a right response to the problem. A necessary one is the experience that we come in contact with a living body, not a suggestion of various kinds of choices by artificial intelligence. It'll be necessary to us that we keep thinking only man is able to do."
8272,"I support your idea. Everyone should be free to decide what they wear. The french government should be more tolerant toward religion. It should build society where every people can live comfortably. To realize such a society, the government, for example, must accept Muslim wearing burkini."
8273,"The U.S. is a democratic country and the election has done fairly. On the other hand, some people doubt whether it is really democratic. Generally, all of the votes by individuals are reflected in the election. Japan accept this. In the U.S., every states choose candidates. Then the ratio of the votes from all states are reflected, not the ones from each person. As a result, many votes are wasted. I believe this system led to Trump winning. The U.S. should reform the election process."
8274,"Anyway they chose him. Actually I do not agree with him, but I am not an American. I'm looking forward to see President Trump now. He seems to be ignorant about politics, and we do not understand him well. Therefore I can not judge him, and I do not want to do so. The only thing I can say is that it will be no longer the USA if they realize Trump's campaign pledge."
8275,"When I heard the news, I thought this system was very useful. I often don't have enough money to buy something I want. It is good to save money, but sometimes I regret. If this system is introduced to various stores, people who only have smartphones can buy products. In addition, we don't have to stand in line, so it has a lot of merits. However, it has serious problems, I think. For example, many workers will be supplanted by the machinery. Recently, it is very often said that growing mechanization deprives people's work. Therefor I think researcher's prediction that the government will begin implementing robotics-specific regulations to preserve jobs should come true."
8276,"I was not surprised at this news because the application of artificial intelligence has been talked about for years. I think Amazon Go is a good idea. You shouldn't stand in line anymore, isn't it nice? In addition, artificial intelligence wouldn't make as many mistakes as human staffs. Since I am working as a staff in a convenience store, I know very well how staffs' mistakes are annoying many busy customers. If use of artificial intelligence become more popular, job description in manufacturing and other fields may occur, but I think it's inevitable. We cannot compete with artificial intelligence in those easy office work or manufacturing because they are very smart, are able to work permanently, and require no salaries. We should rethink about the way to contribute to society which is different from that of artificial intelligence."
8277,"It is very unique system. We can save cost and time, and I think maybe theft decreases. It is wonderful. However we must think about the threat of jobless future when introducing amazing technology. I dream the future that robots do almost all tasks, and all people work for morality and culture."
8278,"I think the system of Amazon Go is good. Because it is very convenience and saves our times when we buy. Furthermore, it prevents stealing products. But the system may be difficult for old people. I want Amazon Go will start soon."
8279,I agree with you. I also hope Trump will be a good president and change the US better.
8280,I agree with you. I also think wearing burkini should not be banned. Because burkini has no connection with terrorism or Islam.
8281,I agree with you. I think sportsmanship is very important. We should think the problem of doping till Tokyo Olympic.
8282,"It's not surprising that Amazon is coming out with conveniently based technology solutions to everyday problems. Apple paved the way with Apple Pay. It's fine to let the automation get rid of the cashier, if it means the price of goods goes down a bit and the money saved is put back into the economy in different ways that helps it grows for everyone. In my opinion, technology is automating so many jobs and that is what people want, and automation of low level jobs is going to continue. So we better start asking some questions about this problems while we can."
8283,"Doping is unfair and it is bad. Athletes who use drug illegally should be punished, but that is not to say its all right to leak private data. I think It's wrong to do a crime to expose an injustice."
8284,"I also think all things shouldn't be depended on machine. Though machine is very useful and has a lot of merits in aging society with a declining birthrate, it is not completely perfect. So, I think coexistence of human and machine is important."
8285,"It isn't better to suppress a specific religion. I think that such act make them promote people's dissatisfaction and make them do terrorism. I think that we must accept a different culture and religion, and cast away a prejudice. That will decrease a fight between different cultures."
8286,"The impact of Amazon Go is huge and I'm very into it after I heard the news about it. However every time when new technology brought into our life, it also contains bad aspect of the technology. This news give me back to see that aspect of Amazon Go. By the way, I think it is not that bad thing that technology replaces our work. In my opinion human is not living for labor. We are living to be happy. If technology replaces our work, our life might be more meaningful."
8287,Japanese food is one of healthiest food all over the world. I eat many kind of food everyday but Japanese food is always taste good and easier to eat whenever I feel sick. It is a sad thing that Japanese food culture replaces one after another. So that I will continue to eat Japanese food as long as I can.
8290,"I was also surprised to hear the news, because he is the last person who I expected. But I think Trump is clever, too. Though there are many problems between America and Japan, he may make the relationship better. I hope that will come true."
8291,"I agree with you. I think almost all Muslims are harmless, It is wrong to associate them with terrorism caused by a part of Muslims. So, the local authorities should not have banned the burkini. There is deep-rooted prejudice against Muslims. We have to eliminate the prejudice and respect each other."
8292,"I agree with your opinion, but I think it is very different. Because we recognize ourselves by differences from others. I hope the world where we can accept various differences."
8293,I agree with you. Philippine people who use or deal drugs should be punished. I hope no one will use or deal drugs with his crackdown.
8294,I think this action is natural. Because companies want to reduce personnel cost for making more profit. This article says our jobs are decreased by Robot. This thing is right. So the jobless will increase and company will need brilliant workers who have special skills. Therefore governments should make new jobs for worker and we should learn more skills for getting other jobs. I hope that my jobs will not decrease until finishing my job hunting.
8295,"I almost agree with your opinion, but I can't understand 'working for morality and culture.' Because I think people evolve by experiencing various aspects of morality, culture and labor, we will want to do tasks."
8296,"I was surprised about American president election system. Because he won the election although he cannot get 50% support of citizen. Trump proposed radical policies. Many people fears carrying out his policies. If Trump carries out his policies, world economy decline. But I think Trump cannot practice all his policies. I have two reason why I think so. First he cannot get 50% support of citizen. He should take another policy by getting citizen's support. Second he knows bad influence on economy. His policies certainly decrease American economy. So he will not do as chief company officer."
8297,"The Olympic should be held fairly of course, but medical records should be protected from hacking at the same time. I want we hold Olympic or other games with clean athletes and believing others."
8298,"I almost agree with your opinion that multinational companies have to pay taxes which commensurate with their sales. However, It has a problem which is decrease in employments. The reason is, there is a tendency that multinational companies set up their branches in the country where the taxes is low. So, we have to consider a good idea to solve this problem, I think."
8299,"I almost agree with your opinion. Russian hackers should not have leaked. But there is no big sense in blaming to Russian government for leaking star athletes' medical files. Because it is more important to study why this accident occurred and to find the solution. Though there is a problem of privacy, athletes would rather to say on the own medical files than they are leaked. If so, it will become one of the solution of this problem that athlete's medical files was leaked."
8300,"I think shops without workers are good idea. This idea is good for both stores and customers. The stores can reduce personal expenses. The robots do not make mistakes because they only follow the program. This can retain store's reputation. The customers can shorten their time for shopping. For those reasons, shops without workers are good idea. However, if we introduce this system, we have to think about the people whose jobs were taken place by robots. I think people and robots have to share the jobs. People can offer hospitality, on the other hand, robots can do jobs that follow a manual precisely.Taking advantage of these good points, shops can offer better service."
8301,"I agree with your opinion. I also think this situation is not Democracy but Dictatorship. Duterte's way to took to punish people who involved in the drugs is too strict. A lot of innocent people may be killed and they face the fear of death. In addition, this strict punishing will possibly be connected with crackdown of freedom of expression. Therefor, it is important for not only Filipino but also us to consider the solution of this problem, I think."
8302,"I was not surprised by the Amazon GO system. Because this system was the system that everyone had been saying for several years. If this system is to be introduced, the store will be able to reduce various things such as cost and time. However, as the work of the machine increases, the work of the person is reduced."
8303,"I was surprised when I heard this news as many of people said. Living in Japan, we didn't heard good news about Trump. Many of my friends said People who elects Trump are joking. However, he became the next president. In this article, he is described as 'coarse, boastful, uninformed and arrogant'. After the election, I cannot feel this election was right for our future because I still hear negative idea to Trump. Anyway, this election is happen and what we can do is just watch what will happen in the future. I wish the world will be more peaceful ."
8304,"I thought this news shows of difficulty of the difference between law and people's feeling. Most things are under the law and people must follow it, however, there are people who cannot regret. For example, there are many smoking area in Japan, but there are some people who are making a frowning face when they walk across. We cannot change one's likes or dislikes, but everyone should not interfere in action which follows a law. Therefore, I strongly think that people who chased off the Muslim woman are wrong. I think these kind of problem will occur in another place, however I wish everyone in this world will have a heart of patience for legal action."
8305,"I felt so scared when I heard this news. In these days, our society became mechanical and each people have many kinds of own data. I believe hacking is breach of privacy and it should be punish. In this case, the hacking was like exposing star athletes' guilt and maybe this is achievement, however, I believe breaching someone's privacy is against the law and should not allow."
8306,I agree with you. Multinational companies are making money than the country's tiny sausage stands so they should pay more tax. People who have many advantage should have a heart of helping others.
8307,"I disagree with the mass-killing. I realized that there are so many people who involve with drugs by this news, however, claiming life is not good. Maybe it is very hard but I want to believe that we can change thinking of them. I wish every criminals can go straight and there is a good way to do it."
8308,"Admittedly, Amazon Go is a convenience system, which enable us to buy goods more smoothly. Then, the company can make money by reducing personnel. However, on the other hand, labor lose their jobs. Unemployment will rise. This will have a negative influence on the economy. Human beings should not rely too much on robots and AI. We should think well when and for what we use them. In many situations, robots can help us. For example, they can carry heavy loads instead of elders. I believe they should do especially what humans cannot do. Thus, Amazon Go is not completely a good system."
8309,"I was very surprised when I read this news. 'Amazon go 'system is amazing and it makes our lives convenient but I am worried about our future that people relies everything on robots. Even though Amazon go have merits such as cutting costs and increasing profits for corporations,it reduces people's job.What happened with the workers who fired their jobs and their family?? I am afraid the future that is very convenient but robots steal our jobs."
8310,"I agree with Alshelh opinion. Not all Muslim people are bad. Even now in Syria the battle continues, most Muslims are not perpetrators but rather victims. we should assume a conciliatory attitude. I hope that there will be no fight."
8312,"I was surprised when I read this article and I agree with Alshel's opinion. If it were not for Burkini, Muslims cannot swim and play in the beach. It is very pitiful. In addition, all people have the right to believe a religion freely. Therefore, I think that it is not problem to put on Burkini. However, it is serious problem, so we should think deeply."
8313,"I was very surprised when I heard that a number of people who use the drug. Japan is very safety, so I did not know the current state. However, it is very serious problem, so we should think deeply about the drug and Duterte's radical campaign."
8317,I agree with you. I can't permit a doping because I was playing track and field. So I think that sportsmanship and fair play are important in a sport.
8318,"It is a good point of view that the election was really democratic. However changing a system of election is not so easy, because it is more comfortable for politicians who won in that style of election. Do you have any good idea to break that conflict?"
8319,"I was very surprised to read this news. Because this is very unprecedented idea and our life become very convenient. In other side, disappearing our job is very serious problem. I think we have to explore a way to become our life convenient without disappearing our job"
8321,The narcotics are terrible thing which break people. Too many broken people will break their country. I think Duterte understands that well. However the solution he do is too extreme to forgive. The person who is the president should be more careful.
8322,"I wish this store is build in Japan soon! I often buy something on the internet,but not seeing shopping sometimes makes mistakes. So I want to buy things with seeing also feel like do on the internet ."
8323,"I think this idea is very good, but also has bad aspects. Good aspects are Amazon Go is very convenient system, futuristic and very cool. In addition, Amazon Go can reduce in personnel expenses, so it is a dreamlike system. But it has a risk that to prosper only Amazon and other large companies, small shops will be culled. And if too spread this system, it is a possibility to be hire fewer people and come economic stagnation. These are the reasons that I oppose Amazon Go . To have a few shops is good for promotion,but Amazon should not to do large scale deployment I think."
8324,"I agree with you. Like you, I thought Clinton would win the election because Trump's remarks were too radical to approve of. I hope that, like Obama, Trump will get along with Japan."
8325,"When I heard this news,I took a science class. In the class people was excited and surprised. so do I. I don't think Trump is qualified,too. But once he is on the post , I hope he acts with self-awareness."
8326,"The latest progress of scientific technology is remarkable.Things considered impossible just ten years ago have come to things possible. 'Amazon.go' can saves our shopping time.But I don't think that it is useless to pay in register. With automation, things which humans have to do is decreasing.This deprives us of the pleasure of achieving an objective."
8327,"The multinational companies' the way of paying less tax is very cunning but smart. However I think they should pay more tax. When I read this article, I felt the companies are so cunning. I think most people think so. That will make serious disadvantage to them. The large companies should donate society."
8328,"After I read your opinion, I thought companies and government should strength of human resource development."
8329,"I have heard this news before in TV. I think technology makes our lives comfortable, but it is some dangerous for labors. Amazon Go cuts cost by introducing robots, so it is good for consumers because they can buy goods cheaply. But it is a problem that robots deprive flesh and bone labors of jobs. We should not rely on convenient technology too much without thinking this serious problem of jobless world."
8330,"I agree with your opinion. Amazon Go is a very innovative system and has a lot of merit for us as a customer. But it also has a big demerit.It will rob us of our jobs. You said 'robot is threat for human'.I am all for it. I am a little bit looking forward to coming it to japan.But if we think it from labors' perspective,Amazon Go is not welcoming for us."
8331,I think women also have a right to wear some swimsuits which they like even if it show their religion or thinking. Ms Alshelh and her mother has to appeal it to all over the world. I wish such a thing is never happened .
8332,What Russian hackers do is a blasphemy to all athlete in the world. The athletes who enter the Olympic games train so hard and devote their lives to the sports. The other athletes hanker for them. I am an athlete so I get angry with that.
8333,"When I first saw this news on TV,I was very surprised.The convenience store without register,shop-staffs,and paying cash is very innovative and will be useful for us.It can cut the labor costs personnel expenses and can decline the price of goods.And we can buy foods and beverages without waiting for register.AmazonGo will help us to have a better life. But to make a convenience store without register and shop-staffs, it also rob the labors of their jobs.It will read to the rising of unemployment-rate. If everything like this convenience store became automatically, almost people will lost their jobs. Automatic bring us both convenience and inconvenience.I hope it that the company consider the balance they should cut and they should not cut."
8334,"I was surprised when I was read this news because Amazon and Starbucks are very famous company and most people would know them. Therefore, I can not believe that they pay less tax than one of the country's tiny sausage stands. Problems of tax is very difficult, so we should think deeply about it."
8335,I agree with you.
8336,I think so. Killing people for the drugs is not an appropriate punishment.
8337,"I think so. For the French, burkini might make them afraid.there is nothing for it but to do"
8338,I agree with you .Public welfare is important for local people.
8339,I think so.
8340,I think so.This idea is creatable. I wish this move is continued.
8341,"I disagree with the Trump's racist thinking. Instead of finding fault with the group like IS, people need to know the reasons why they are necessary to do such a harmful things. The precondition to solve the problem must be the way to understand opposite side's standpoints."
8342,"After I read the article, I am quite shocked. Many experts always claims the capitalism's limit will come in near future, and have negative thought about the energy and environment problem. But I strongly believe the science and technology will make a miracle to whole human, ad we will have a better day than before."
8343,"I saw this news last year on the internet, and I did not think about very seriously. But after I read this article, I think the personal liberty should not be a hamper to others and society."
8344,"In my opinion, it is good idea to use Amazing go. Machine has various function.However, I am worried about this system. Thought it is convenient to use machine, using machine in a extreme way is bad. Recently,the number of people is increasing, more people will look for a job. using machine in a extreme way led people to lose job."
8345,"It is a quite funny and unique question in my eyes. However, as a law faculty student, I cannot understand why the mother's life is worthy than the girlfriend's. There must be some normal reason like, 'because my mother is the best people in the world for me.' Nevertheless, I think it is a personal liberty to choose who to save. Because the life's worth is the same."
8346,"After I read the article, I found that Amazon Go is quite a unique retail shop. If it will open someday, I am willing to use this shop and get items. However, the problem is, in the modern society, one of the most significant problem is employment difficulty. This problem is coming down to all over the world, and every country's government are trying to coping with stress. Amazon, as one of the most famous international giants, should do something to give back to society, instead to invoke the problems like this."
8347,"I think he is very dangerous because his action will break the law custom. In a long run, he is not qualified for president."
8350,"I agree with you. When Trump be a president, I'm so shocked. However, we should accept Trump. He might make America great again."
8354,I agree with your idea. This is really complex problem. There is no alternative to them in Japan now. So it can't be helped to lean on nuclear power now.
8355,"I'm also afraid of technology destroys more jobs than it creates. It's serious problem. All person should think about it. However, I suppose we have the way to coexist with robots."
8356,I agree with you. I think he doesn't take appropriate measure. Duterte abuses his power.
8357,"I disagree with you, Ryo. It is very difficult problem. But when we capture this tax evasion as their idea to gain more profit, we cannot sweepingly say that it was a bad thing. In my opinion, this problem is caused by the system of EU states with low-tax regimes that have lured multinationals."
8358,"I have been interested in the problem. I think the AI system is very dangerous because they eliminate human's jobs. However, scientific progress is inevitable. In the future, artificial intelligence will be used for the simple jobs. So, we should acquire the creative skill."
8359,I agree with you. Multinational companies which afford about a money face should pay more tax than tiny companies. And I think every companies should pay tax appropriately.
8360,"This kind of new style retail shop has many advantage to our life. So I am happy to hear the news. However, many people lamented that technology makes threat to the jobs. I think technology approves us convenience and efficiency. It do destroy jobs. But the merit we get from it is always bigger than disadvantage. So we should keep the technology and do some effort to solve the problem. There will be plenty of solution to the problem."
8361,I think so. before reading your comment. I just think artificial technology is good and convenient. But now I recognize something that maybe human can do better.
8362,I was very surprised when I read this article. I think Amazon Go is very interesting. I'm going to use this shop.
8363,I agree with your opinion. It is true that automation brings profits for both of companies and customers. What we should do to protect our job is not to prevent automation but to think about what are the jobs that only human can do.
8364,Hey ID1600! How are you? I think you are well informed about American culture. I was so enjoyed reading your comments.
8365,"Hi! I was surprised that you have not heard this news. I think this system is an epoch-making invention. It can be cut the person costs. Also we are able to save the time to line up at a resister. I agree with you. See you, bye!"
8366,"I was impressed by your comment, because your viewpoint is totally new for me. I've never considered about losing of human abilities. It is true that we lost the ability to do many things people in old time knew how to do. For example, most people made their clothes by themselves, but now almost all of us don't know how to make strings or cloths. However, I think it's no problem because this phenomenon is a part of human evolution. We evolved along changes in the world, and we acquired new abilities to live in today's world. Our ancestors might be able to run faster than us, but didn't know how to use smartphone."
8367,"I agree with your opinion. Probably artificial intelligence is able to acquire experience, but it's not enough to obtain human heart. I believe only living bodies with real human emotion can make true human relationships. Because all of artificial intelligence's behaviour is just a result of vast calculations."
8368,"I agree with you. Same phenomenon was occurred in Brexit vote. I think this is the biggest weak point of democracy. As a member of democratic society, we must think about our country's politics deeply and vote carefully."
8369,I disagree with your point of view. Because I think Trump could be a good president in that he has unique idea in business and could bring up the economy and finance to all over the world.
8370,"I agree with you. American people's frustration for current political system let Trump won this election. He may be a game changer in international politics and economy, so we should keep watch on his movements."
8371,"It is a nice and interesting question! I think the U.S. has to revise the constitution in order to reform the election process. I agree with you in that it is so difficult to do this. As a solution, when the next presidential election, people should vote a person who have the ambition to change that system. There would be still many difficulties, but, even a little, this would contribute to changing the American democracy. How about you? What do you think is the best way to solve this problem?"
8372,"I have read your comment because you recommended me to read. You have a lot of right and interesting ideas and I support them. World leaders should not kill people. Some people will deserve to be punished because of the use of drugs, but others may not have committed drug crimes. They may be innocent. If it is a false charge, we can do nothing anymore after the death penalty. This would lead to the people's anger and the unstable society. Next, it is a good idea to send people addicted to drugs to rehabilitation centers. By doing this, they can turn over a new leaf and get chances to live in society again."
8373,"You're right. Major religions have been divided into many small groups and those groups have been making a lot of conflicts. I think the most important thing is to eliminate biases against other religious groups. It may difficult to understand other religions, but we should accept religious diversity."
8374,"I agree with you. I was also disappointed to French government. The government treated burkini as a symbol of terrorism. This is clearly a bias against Islamic people. However, we cannot blame French government, because Japanese government is limiting immigration in order to prevent terrorism. Since Paris tragic had occurred, main concern of governments has been the protection of national security, and this situation created a bias against Islam."
8375,"I agree with your opinion. Burkini is necessary for Muslim women to enjoy marine sports. The ban of burkini limits freedom of belief, freedom of wearing, and freedom of activity. This is severe violation of human rights."
8376,"I cannot agree with your idea, because medical record is very personal information and I think medical privacy must be protected even in the case of athletes."
8377,I agree with you. There must be a better way to prevent doping.
8378,"I agree with you. What the president have to do is to change people's perception toward drug use, not to kill a lot of people."
8379,"I think so too. It is true that there are some specialists who criticise him for being arrogant. But he surely had the ability to make big money, so I think it is possible for him to change the present circumstances."
8380,"Yes, and I think this shows the difference in tax strategies between Japanese companies and international companies in the US. Today, big international companies are using international law experts to pay less tax. Some people say Japanese companies should study international tax systems to compete with those international companies, but it's controversial problem."
8381,I agree with you. Breaking the law is supposedly impermissible thing. It's even less of a surprise that president obey the law. It is important that killing only the person who committed criminal act to build a normal society.
8382,"I agree with you. Avoidance of tax is highly respectable strategy to advance the interests of the company. It is certainly true that large companies pay less tax. But this act is cerebral-powered act and don't break the law. So, this act shouldn't be blamed."
8383,"I was shocked because of the number of the people that Duterte killed, in very short term. I can't understand the reason why Duterte won the election and became a president in Philippine. I think it is very natural to punish one who commit a crime, but we cannot be too careful when condemn a criminal to death."
8384,"I was very surprised that I didn't know this news though amazon and Starbucks are big and famous company. We should not miss news like this. I thought I should have pay more attention to world news. Or I would pay money to amazon,Starbucks,apple and so on.without knowing they cheating"
8385,"I agree with this comment. the idea that how to prevent stealing is that I can not conceive. I think if we introduce this idea, we have to consider how to prevent stealing more seriously."
8386,"I agree with your improvement plan. I think we should educate sports associations including coaches, players and so on. This is ultimately effective countermeasure. we take steady work to lighten up the situation."
8387,"I am interested in your viewpoint that Amazon Go might prevent the rubbery in stores. It is true that shopping with no cash is a little frightening , but I think this innovation surely makes people impressed."
8388,"I also think that we should accept the result of the US president election. We need to understand not only the Trump's diplomatic policy but also those of other countries , especially in Asia. For instance, now the connection between America and China is growing strong more and more. In contrast, the existence of Japan has become smaller."
8390,"After I read this article, I agreed with the statement of Mr Obama. I think it is naturally that same-sex couples are able to wed. However there are a lot of prejudice against homosexuality. We have to accept and respect various thoughts. Even if it is difficult to accept, we must not hurt same-sex couples."
8391,"I agree with this comment. First, i mistook burkini for a kind of bikini, too. and I think everyone in the world have freedom of religion. So we must not ban burkini."
8392,i agree with this comment. I think multinational companies which earn a lot of money must pay taxes which meet their profit.
8395,"I was very surprised to read this article. Generally,multinational companies such as Amazon and Starbucks can earn more money than small businesses. However, they actually pay less tax. This is unequal."
8396,I agree with you. The large companies such as Amazon and Starbucks should build trust as companies which support our lives because they are indispensable for us.
8397,"i agree with this comment. No matter what narcotics do bad things, we do not have to kill them. So I think we have to think about another better way in order to decrease the number of narcotics."
8398,"I think this is good idea, but I was uneasy. Hawking said that completion of perfect artificial intelligence means human death. I think that machine works instead of human means human death in a sense."
8400,"I agree with you. If the sports press makes the problem clear, what will happen is that dodgy doctors will give 'exemptions' and everyone will take drugs 'legally'. So they should have made this clear before this hack."
8401,"I'm also conflicted about Burkini. Burkini is very visible symbols of the rejection of western values. In every country, burkini is seen as symbols of the subjugation of women. Maybe when a woman decides to choose to wear burkini, she should take into some consideration the customs and values of the country she is in as the one making this decision. But this measure is too strict."
8407,"I almost agree with you. There are a lot of traffic accidents, and many people are killed by them. Therefor I agree with the introduction of self-driving vehicles. However, I doubt that self-driving vehicles are really safety. I think Google should not introduce self-driving vehicles until the safety confirms completely. But if the safety is confirmed, I want to use those in the future."
8409,"I think 'Amazon Go' is very unique and innovative system. This is because we could buy something without standing in line and waiting accounts. This system is very useful for people who don't have many time, for example us. And also, for the company, this system is good. This is because the system doesn't need to employ cashiers, so it don't need to labor cost. You may be worry about our future, like 'Robots take jobs by force from people.' But it is very natural on the viewpoint of history that new technology robs us jobs. For example, in the Industrial Revolution, the technical experts are fired by spreading machines. Therefore these changes are necessary for growing. We should get used to these changes quickly."
8410,"Telling children that drug is very dangerous is very important , I think. I think that there are many alternatives to be substituted for. He has been involved in the selfish , unreasonable killing."
8411,"I have the same opinion to you. It is true that doping is unfavorable for the sound sportsmanship, but the secret of privacy shouldn't be revealed by hacking without enough evidence."
8412,"I think it should not necessarily be ruled out that the multinational companies choose the lower-tax countries. It is important to consider what is unfair , based on each country's economic power."
8413,"I was very surprised at this result of American presidential election, that is Donald Tramp won. This result would influence on Japan about 3 things, one is security, and other is economy, and last, finance. First, about security. Now it is situations where we have America protect us from foreign enemies. However, Donald Trump wants to break off a support for security. He said 'Japan is protected by America for free! Many American soldiers are killed for protecting Japan!!' If American army breaks off a support for security, we have to protect ourselves by the Self-Defense Forces. And then, the defense costs of Japanese government will be 20~25 billion yen, this number is as 45 times as present the defense costs. Second, about economy. Donald Trump states 'America First,' and criticizes free trade such as TPP. And he wants to increase taxes on Japanese products. Therefor Japanese products will not sell. Third, about finance. Donald Trump did election activity without political contribution, so he tends to administer without intentions of Wall Street and International companies. For example, he wants to reduce taxes and relaxation of regulation. Therefor there will be strong yen on the exchange market, and so Japanese economy will be worse. From these three elements, This result would do damage to Japan, I think. I want to see carefully what is happening now and will happen in the future."
8414,"I think so. Robots will be spread in our society in the future, so we should think over how we coexist with robots. In my opinion, we strengthen our skills of thinking, because robots don't have the skills."
8415,"I was surprised by this news because 'Amazon Go' is very innovative system.While I think I want to use this system,I cannot help feeling uneasy about accuracy of the system.There will be some problems when 'Amazon Go' is made practicable in the world. Of course,I'm anxious about loss of employment. The systems like 'Amazon Go' which do not need the power of the person will increase more and more in future and will take the work of the person.But,as a matter of fact,I don't feel a sense of danger in this situation because I think there is a lot of work that a person only can do."
8416,I think so too.We should get used to these changes .And I think these changes will not only lose the employment but also create the employment in a certain aspect.
8417,"Your opinion, 'Amazon Go' is useful for saving money for us is very fresh to me! However, in the case of me, I may buy a lot of commodities in this system, because I lose the sense of costing money."
8418,I think so. We couldn't expect he would do from now on very well. I had no choice but to hope Donald Tramp will change relationship between America and Japan better.
8419,"I agree with your opinion. Choosing swim wear freely is rights for each people, so ban of burkini is big problem for not only Muslim women but also every people over the world."
8420,"I think so. I think almost all Muslims are harmless, so It is wrong to associate them with terrorism caused by a part of Muslims. Therefor banning for wearing Burkini is wrong."
8421,I think so too. It shouldn't be leaked by the hacking but announced officially by government.
8422,"I think so. The problem is small-scale country such as Ireland and the Netherlands stole tax of multinational companies by cooperating tax cheating. Therefore, multinational companies should pay more taxes."
8423,I agree with you. Too strict way will provoke Philippine people's anger. And he will be difficult to conduct state affairs.
8424,"Someday, I would like to live and work in other countries. After reading your comment, I felt I have to think how to get along with religion and religious people."
8425,"I agree with you. The french government should respect Muslims more. As one of the ways, it should not ban burkinis. By doing so, they could live more comfortable and this would lead to decreasing crimes and terrorism caused by Muslims."
8426,"Your idea is interesting. Today, the U.S. has many problems, such as economy, poverty and immigration. People are suffered from these problems, and they expect someone changes this situation. Then, Trump appeared. They trust him, and now, I also hope he would change America splendidly. How influence will he have on the world?"
8428,"I agree with this opinion. I think doping is so bad, but the Russian hackers leak is as bad as doping. I hope this problem will be solved until the Tokyo Olympics and Tokyo Olympics will held safely."
8432,"I agree with you. Both says an extreme things and be attracted attentions, however I also think Duterte is going too far. I have no idea what can be earned by his words and actions."
8433,"I understand your opinion.However, I will not say using drugs is as the serious problem as the leaking information. I also think using drugs are unfair and should be punish, but this is not in a law. In contrast, leaking information is breach of privacy and this is illegal. I am not saying 'using drugs is not bad because it is legal'. In my opinion, leaking people's privacy is heavier guilt."
8435,I think so too.I think it is necessary to get defence system when new system install
8436,I agree with you. I think the full automatic car is the best example that makes the traffic accidents decrease
8437,I disagree with you. I think it is bad to consider about only the facing profit.I think we should consider about problem that may be going to happen in the future.
8438,I disagree with you. I think there are the more tasks that only human can do however the robots do almost tasks in the future.
8439,I think so too. But I think we should think not only merit but also demerit.
8440,I agree with you. I think that reflection is the danger of the democracy.
8441,I was surprised about the result of the election too. I worry about Trump's policy.But I think it can't help doing harm to American people.
8442,I almost agree with you.But I don't think Trump is clever.Because I think American people didn't vote for him because of his cleverness but his craziness.
8443,I agree with you . I think it is boring if this world becomes no various thing.
8444,I agree with you. But we shouldn't think about only the right but also the risk of the right.
8445,I agree with you. I think this ban is banning not only wearing burkini but also the freedom of Muslim women .
8446,I agree with you. But I think to choose easy course is the weakness and identity of human.
8447,I agree with you. I think the reason that athletes are special is to play fair.So I think the player who use doping is real athlete.
8448,I think so too.And I hope that all athletes will play in the Tokyo Olympic.
8449,I don't agree with you.Because I think the too high tax makes the companies lose their motivation.So we should think the middle point of the both.
8450,"I don't agree with you.Certainly,to force is not good.But the companies won't pay more tax without force."
8451,I agree with you.I think big company should pay more tax than small company does.but we should pay attention to tax rate.
8452,"I'm also afraid that automations will undermine the human's jobs. But I don't think all sorts of jobs will be replaced with robots. In fact , I often use the self-registering system , and I don't find any inconvenient points."
8453,"I think the ban for the burkini is inappropriate. First, the official comments that burkini is a symbol of enslavement of women are very discriminatory. Second , it has a bad effect on the interaction between Europe and Islamism. Such prohibitions will generate only further hate."
8457,I agree with you. He should find any other solutions for solve social problem in Philippine and it has to be a rational way.
8458,Your opinion is interesting for me. I thought that multinational companies should pay more tax than tiny companies in every countries. I find that we need to think how economic policy are chosen in each country from your opinion.
8459,"I think so,too. And french who attack Muslim need to understand correctly the aim of burkini."
8460,"It was very surprising that Trump won the president election. In my opinion, the result of the election will have many bad influence on the world. His policy and statement is extreme. One of the example of this extreme policy is about illegal immigration. He said that America will make the wall at the border between America and Mexico and Mexico should pay the cost of making the wall. The relationship between America and Mexico will become terrible because of this. Moreover, he said that he would prohibit Muslim to enter America. He might say that America should attack the Islamic state and Al-Qaeda and the large war might occur. I wish that Trump will revise what he said and the things will not get worse."
8461,"Technology is just always answering people's needs. So I almost have any surprising to Amazon's go. Actually, there's already have been many supermarket have similar service like with no register. So in my opinion, what we should do is to accept this developing way of our society, and thinking about the other needs to our community which couldn't provide my robots but just human can do. Maybe it relative to something couldn't rely on the regulation and number."
8462,"I also think it was a revenge against the punishment for doping. Even though some Russian athletes could not join the Olympics, its punishment was a right thing. This would lead to people feeling how bad and wrong doping is. The number of such incidents would decrease. I hope someday the Olympics would be held completely fairly."
8463,"We should come up with the ways to make the Olympics held fairly. Of course , one of the ways is to check whether someone have not done doping. Is there any solutions? I think it is important to tell athletes that they should contend fairly. Winning is not everything."
8464,"I agree with you. His policy and statement is extreme. One of the example of this extreme policy is about illegal immigration. He raises America 's first principle, and there are possibilities of creating confrontation with other countries. I hope that conflict will not spread by his winning."
8465,"As you say, I felt how cruel he is! It is true that drugs have a bad influence on the society and I also hope the drug abuses would disappear. However, I cannot support his way. Even if people have committed a crime,they should not be killed morally. We should come up with other solutions to remove crimes."
8466,"I really agree with you. The technology like robots would take away our jobs. Admittedly, using robots can cut down on cost, but many people lose jobs. This would lead to economic problems. Many people could not afford to buy freely, and a business cycle would become worse. We have to utilize technology with thinking carefully."
8467,"I agree with you. I think such problem should be found by dope test, not by leaking by hackers."
8468,"Read this article, I found a very impressive part. It was that Ms Zanetti said it was not a religious garment. I thought burkini is religious garment of course, but the original proposer didn't mean so and it make me very surprise. I guess many of those who feel uncomfortable about burkini may associate burkini with Muslim, and terrorism. I want them to know that it is not religious garment. It was made for just Muslim women's liberty."
8469,"It is said that this US election was very 'negative' one. Many American don't like both of candidates and the resort was just people feel Trump may be better than Clinton, even he often said offensive and discriminatory thing. I feel very sorry that many people couldn't vote on someone that they really support."
8470,"It's due to companies to decrease the costs. They make a social contribution to reap profits. Tax collected from companies serve as a secure foundation for society. But, government need to take measures to decrease unemployment."
8473,"I agree with your opinion. I think that there are both merits and demerits in machine and human.We can not decide which to choose,there is no necessary for us to do that."
8474,"I think that there are both merits and demerits in machine and human.We can not decide which to choose,there is no necessary for us to do that. I am very thrilled with Amazon Go.It is very revolutionary, probably changes our life style."
8475,"I think so.I was surprised that Tramp won,too.He makes very extreme remarks,so I thought that opinion was against him. But people supported him."
8476,"Before reading this article,I did not know about Trump very well. I was surprised that Trump won,too.He makes very extreme remarks,so I thought that opinion was against him. But people supported him.I take notice of his remark and his moves."
8482,"I agree with you. Trump may change the country, but it may not be a good because many countries would receive bad influence. Especially, the problem of TPP is serious. This is not an easy problem, so we should see carefully and think deeply about his action."
8483,"I am interested in art, but I cannot understand why some rich people want pictures, paying so much money. In this article, it is said that this would cause inflation and we would not be able to see pictures if an individual buy it. I was shocked especially to know we cannot see them anymore. Masterpieces should be seen by many people and more and more people should be moved to see them."
8484,"I was impressed by your idea. It will be true that hiding pictures from people makes it difficult to study them. There are still a lot of mysteries about pictures, such as ones painted by Picasso. We should know them and this would lead to flourishing the field of art."
8485,"I think that this is difficult problem. Of course, machines and Internet are very useful in every aspect of business and our lives. However, problems related to excessive reliance on them would happen such as employment issue and liability issue. These have big influence on Japanese society. Therefore, I think that government should control balance of human and machines in business."
8486,"I also doubt whether the self-driving vehicles. If Google could prove it is safe, I want to try driving it. Then, I hope by our using these cars, the number of car accidents will decrease."
8488,"I think this is very difficult problem. If drone strike in common with this article, many civilian would die. It is grave international trouble. So, many people should not make drone. However, technology of drone is very important in a variety of contexts such as lifesaving. Thus, I think that this technology is not necessarily mean unhappiness. Therefore, we should think carefully about this problems and establish rules for this."
8490,I agree with you. We should think about which is better machine or human. I think we should choose one as the situations demand.
8491,I agree with you. The multinational companies including Amazon and Starbucks should pay more tax.
8492,I agree with you. Surely I think the picture of plus sized model should be accepted. So we should judge with thinking about the contents.
8493,"From a viewpoint of privacy, What Russian computer hackers has done is not sanctioned. They trampled and hurt athletes' feelings. However, we should consider why they got involved in crime like this. In my view, the World Anti-Doping Agency has the exclusive and unclear character, so it causes partial distrust in Wada. It could happen again unless Its character is improved. In any case, all we can do is have the firm spirit of fair play and form the surroundings which does not permit doping."
8494,"we have the rational faculty, so we try to respond rationally, not emotionally. In this case, it is obvious that burkini and terrorism are not related together at all. It is nonsense to suggest their connection as well as to point out that all Whites are white supremacists. To be sure, the Muslim in Europe don't have a strong enough desire to integrate themselves into their local community, which brings erroneous suspicion and dissatisfaction of local Europeans. But, the authorities' measure is illegal in that it invaded personal liberty. they should consider and find reasonable solution to this issue."
8495,I think so too. I think that government should control balance of human and machines in business.
8496,I agree with this comment. Machine is very correct but that is lack of human touch. We have to choose which way we should use.
8497,"I agree with this comment. In the world, there are a lot of people who have many kind of religions. We must accept other people who have another religions."
8498,I agree with this comment. Revenge do not make solution. We do not have to revenge in order to solve the problem. We must make solution without revenge.
8499,I agree with this comment. Multinational companies should have to pay more tax. And there are a lot of other companies which pay less tax. these companies have to pay more tax.
8500,"I think so too. I do not think Trump is qualified, but he is elected. I feel uneasy about the result. But the result is not overturned. All we can do is that Trump carry out politics for the benefit of the people."
8501,"I agree with this comment. It is important for us that not only we punish criminals, but also educate them and return to society."
8502,I think so too. I think that government should not deprive of human's right.
8503,I agree with this comment. Climbing is hard for young people like us. But he is 89 years old and he climbed Mt Everest. he taught us the importance of challenge.
8504,I think so too. This incident is something that should not be. I also think that US have to try their best to prevent such crime.
8505,"If I were an American, I voted for Mr. Trump by the process of elimination. This is because Mr. Obama -a leading statesman of 'Establishment'- could not bring more changes and profits to Americans for 8 years than I had expected. Ms. Clinton is nothing but an unskillful and doubtful imitator of Obama. What could I want her like that to do? Can you imagine her making the U.S. better? It is true that Trump knows almost nothing about politics. What is worse, he repeated again and again remarks taking racist slant and threatening the concept of freedom. But, you should not forget that he is a career successful businessman. He is smart. He may have the competence as not only a businessman but a leader of a nation. In the final analysis, the chief cause of Trump's victory can only expressed in this words: his rival - Hillary Clinton- offered no appeal."
8506,"I think the situation about employment in the future cannot be taken lightly. As this article says, the rise of robots equipped with artificial intelligence is remarkable in recent years. It is a matter of time that they surpass average persons in all respects. Depending how things develop, a lot of people will become at a loose end. In order to live through the times like that, I try to cultivate a creative mind and to treasure my individuality."
8507,I was surprised to read this article. It's unbelievable that there was a probability that some athletes who won a gold in Rio had taken restricted drugs. And also I think Russian computer hackers are responsible for violating the right of privacy.
8508,I agree with you. Organization must find out more about the health of athletes and protect their privacy from computer hackers.
8509,"I think this system is very useful. However,many people will come to waste their money on trifles. This problem is very serious. Certainly, our society will be more and more comfortable,but we should think about carefully the problem which it can cause."
8510,"I agree with you. I heard that the USA was a salad bowl and they was accepting many kinds of people, and I have believed so. Therefore I am disappointed when I think about American antisemitism, a Red witch-hunt, racial discrimination or Trump's win."
8511,"The conclusion is inevitable that American voted selfishly because it was their own voting. Anyway I can not understand his 'Great America'. He says that his Great America help poor labor especially whites, and I think many Americans expect his drastic reform for those labor. However I suspect he is the king of capitalism, which makes too rich people and too poor people. Therefore I suspect his Great America for Americans."
8512,"I think so too. Whether he is good or bad, we should not run about in confusion. Actually we must criticize politics for our democracy, but people like statesmen should keep a cool head. Losing calmness would be playing right into his hands."
8513,"I think so too. If we destroy our democracy, the next generation's justice will be no longer democracy."
8514,I think so too. He do many bad things that only think about America and may make the new problem in the world. For example he requires some car companies to stop building factory and employ many Americans. His policy is protective doctrine and it may cause economical conflicts. We should gaze into American action.
8515,I agree with a part your comment and disagree with a part your comment. You think Duterte is very cruel person. I think so too. But You think the good way to punish drag criminal is arresting people. I think Philippine already has done this measure. And They cannot eradicate these criminals. It cannot help killing people. I think they should need to improve their education and change people's sense.
8516,"I agree with you. There are many different thinking and many different people in the world, but probably our diversity is based on discrimination. So it is easy for us to change diversity to exclusion-ism. However if we just had reason, it would be easy to live in harmony."
8517,"I think so too, and I suppose that we should not regard opinions of opponents who hate burkini."
8518,"I agree with you. Amazon Go will make our society very comfortable. However,it can cause jobless future. We should think about this."
8519,"I agree with you, we have to pursue our conveniences, we may have to give up them for our jobs at the same time."
8520,"Kern's opinion is exactly right. Google and Facebook improved performance in Austria, but they didn't pay enough tax for that. It is unacceptable to hide any profits by multinational company. They should provide service that commensurate with the company size for not only citizen but also countries."
8521,"There isn't a connection between terrorism and the burkini, and also there isn't a connection between terrorism and Islam. However,many people tend to regard Islam as dangerous. Unless there are this trend,this problem can't be solved."
8522,I agree with you. Burkini doesn't have a serious impact on society. We should think about this problem.
8523,"I think so,too. The thing the Russian hackers did may makes the profit in Olympics, it doesn't always be profitable. It may harm anyone."
8524,I agree with your opinion''a criminal's basic rights should also be respected.' Drug users break the peace and they are the subject of criticism. But I think there is another way to solve this problem.
8525,"This action might be thought that is Russian's revenge. Russian government has denied any involvement, but it's the same not to express anything as supporting hackers. Next US president Donald Trump wants to improve relation with Russia, however, if the incident like that happens again, not only Olympic but people safety would be threatened from 'latest twist'."
8526,"I agree with you, economics systems will collapse. They must follow the rules for maintain economics systems."
8527,"I think so, too. I wondered how they manage goods and prevent stealing. However, there is no resister, so amazon can employ many guards or observers instead, I think."
8528,"Your comment is very important for live with people who have another culture and religion. French know that, I think. However, they may attack Muslims to protect themselves. I hope they respect each others."
8529,I agree with you. I like the system because of the merits it has. Surely it has serious problem like workers' problems. I wanna use the system soon.
8531,I agree with you. I hope doping will decrease not to be leaked by the hackers.
8532,I agree with you. His crackdown was too cruel. And I also hope the number of people who use drugs will disappear.
8534,"I think so too. Amazon Go's idea that to use robots instead of labor force is very amazing, but it may threat any other companies. So Amazon should have a few shops for promotion,but Amazon should not to do large scale deployment in Japan."
8535,"Through this article, I've been thinking about the future. I'm a heavy user of Amazon and I was interested in this new project already. However It's more convenient than I thought. Now I studied geography especially about 'Regional creation'. I think this Amazon's challenge must help it. If the man who is a creator of website / a president of IT business lives in the countryside, there are many goods delivered by Amazon Go. There are no difference between the difficulty in countryside and that in city. I think Amazon Go will take us to the future."
8536,"I agree with your opinion. In the future, simple jobs will be worked by robots. Robots develop quickly. Recently Human Go fighter lose at AI. Our jobs may decrease. So the government should change the education to bring up our creative ability."
8537,"I agree with your opinion. But now, Duterte is very popular in Philippine. they may believe that he wipe out criminals, so they should to end purge and to unit by more peaceful way instead of killing. And wake up him from murder and violent policy."
8538,"I agree with you. It is serious problem for us. Article 9 is very important for Japan.Therefore, we should think deeply about this."
8540,I agree with your opinion. People has the right that allow freedom of religion and should be free what they wear. So French action about Burkini is unjust. By the way you thought France is symbol of freedom before. I think France is not freedom on the culture. Because I think that French proud their culture but they do not respect other country's culture( especially not Europe). For example they broke sphinx' nose.
8541,"I agree with you. I think the price of goods will be lower by saving personnel expenses,too. The automation is good not only for companies but also for customers. We should take advantage of automation and use both technology and human workers. If we use technology and human workers according to the situation, we can work more efficiently and smoothly."
8542,"I agree with you. Purpose of companies is to make profit. So, it is not surprising that companies use robots.We must keep up with the times."
8543,I agree with this comment. Recently people makes the world more comfortable with technologies but is it good? I do not think so. The good comfortable rich life cannot always makes people happy. Convenience is not everything for people. I think shopping means enjoying also standing is line to buy new goods. I do not hate standing in line because i can't wait to buy new clothes or bags . I was excited then.
8544,"Before election returns prompt report, none of my family believed in my word 'Trump will win' . Then he won. My family was so surprised on it. From the above, I feel insecure now. The TV show didn't report the the predominant wind direction of Trump and most Japanese didn't think Trump would won. I think this pointed indifference is dangerous for our future. We Japanese people should have more interest."
8545,I think the people of Okinawa prefecture's angry is of course. They suffer big damage from American's attack. So some people have bad emotion for American army. But we should think about national defense on the deep scale. Okinawa locates near in China. And Okinawa has Senkaku. We should think worst case. How do we act if China occupy Senkaku? American power is very big. Therefore American Army has the deterrent power. We needs American power to protect Japan. Okinawa's base problem should not only think about people's feelings.
8546,I agree with this comment. Nobody can expect that Trump was chosen the US President. I do not know why he was elected even though his speech was too violent and he discriminated . But now we have to accept this situation and we have to think about our future with that President. I hope the US and Japan continue to have good relation ship.
8547,I think same way as this comment. Not all Islam is dangerous. But the TV says Islam and people are confused. So it is very important to chose the right information from the society which has too much information.
8549,"I agree with you. Like you, I had never imagined Trump would win. I worry that he does not listen to people's opinion and behave exclusively because his opinion is radical and selfish. I hope him to consider people's ideas and feelings and look at things from various point of view, too."
8550,I agree with your opinion. Multinational companies use the hole of low and earn huge money. So all countries should cooperate to make measure against multinational companies. Tax is very important to maintain country's infrastructures. Therefore we should begin to take action as soon as possible.
8551,"I agree with it. In Sports , all people are equal. Even though an athlete uses drugs to enhance the performance and if he or she wins, are they happy?? If I were the athlete , using drugs and winning the game is not my skill. I do not want the medal with the drugs."
8552,I agree with it. The law protect our free. It is difficult to decide what kind of photos should be banned.
8553,I agree with your opinion. Doping bad things for both the said person and other normal people. Doping is bad for human body and Doping breaks the other people's effort. So it should be prohibited. Hacking is the bad thing too. Hacking is crime and cannot be justified.
8556,"Victory of Trump was shocked by all over the world. Obama was so clever that he could not take active action for 'Change', therefore he gave disappointment or frustration to most of supporters. The election result is symbolic of their emotional storm. However, the cost of this 'gamble' is too large to take a bet, I think. Because revival of the coal industry and antipathy to China might be caused frictions in economics or militaries. And finally, it can be thought that cause the worst situation. I think, this is the biggest gamble that the bet is the Earth!"
8557,"I agree with you. I should check what Trump does and says carefully because his action affect not only America but also the countries around the world. I still have bad images to Trump and worry about the world's future, but what I can do now is just hoping him for changing the world better."
8558,"I agree with this comment. I was also very surprised. People know the risk of the nuclear power but the fact is that they heavily depend on nuclear power. It is time to think new renewable power such as wind , water ."
8559,"I agree with you. Americans ,mostly white, seemed to have frustration and need change, so Trump could be seen as Messiah by them. As you say, I hope world peace comes true, too."
8560,"I agree with it. Even though there are trends that many Islamic terrorist attack occurs, banning Muslim immigrants are very cruel i think. Not all Muslims are dangerous. It can be said discrimination to Muslims. But I think Trump can be a good leader ,because leader need to have not kindness but a leader need cruel and fast determination. Trump has that kind of things. He does not move the heart easily so he can be a good leader."
8561,"I agree with your opinion that 'the jobless will increase and company will need brilliant workers who have special skills'. There are few people who have special skill, so I worry that many people be robbed their jobs by robots and loose jobs. We have to make rules for using technology for example AI, in order to protect ourselves."
8562,I was very surprised when i read this news. Choosing a mother or a girlfriend is very difficult question. If i were the person who has to chose i cannot find my answer in that situation. i think i want to save both so i want to try to help both my mom and my boyfriend. But we have rights to think freely so it is crazy that choosing girl friend is crime. Our decision are not right or wrong.
8563,"I agree with you. Anti-doping movement should be done by not hacker but specialists. In addition, hacker is likely to criminal, so we should not believe their claims!"
8565,"I can't notice this possibility. How to save products by stealing is the big problem. But I think amazon's store has High precision surveillance camera. So stealing is much difficult than other store. In addition, entering the store, customers have to use ID authentication. This helps prevention of Shoplifting."
8566,"I agree with you. I was very surprised when I heard China use resources effectively such as solar energy. However, if some countries act for the environment, there is little logic to environmental recovery because this problem is very serious. So, I think that all countries should begin doing action for the decrease of CO2 emissions."
8567,"I have same threat of jobless too. In the near future, human may make products like food and machines may sell them. Or there will be the future that people have only to live happy life without working. This is like a SF but I'm looking forward to see the future."
8568,"I think so, too. Following the rules is very safety for both economics and each companies. It is unacceptable to collapse economics of the world by only few companies cheating."
8569,"I agree with this opinion. Because I think it is a good thing to grow automation. Human work may be diminished. However, there are some jobs that only man can do."
8571,"I think so, too. I was also surprised at the difference between bikini and burkini, It should be freedom to wear any clothes wherever we are, whenever we are."
8572,"I don't think crackdown is better method to punish people who committed a crime because this is too strictly. Harsh way isn't always best. I think this crackdown may make hatred to Duterte. In other words, this action may trigger assassination of Dutelte.I hope Philippine become peaceful."
8573,"I agree with you. Duterte killed too much people, however, this campaign has made the crime rate down. Of course, his campaign goes too far, but it is effective for decreasing Philippine's crime."
8574,"Before I read this article, I did not know about the presidential election of America at all. However, I could read about this article and learn about the presidential election in the US. Also, reading this article made me distrustful that Mr. Trump would become President. I would like to pay attention to what action President Trump will take from now on."
8575,"I think so too, burkini makes French fear. But burkini is an identity of Muslim woman and fusion of old custom and liberalization. Islam is not ISIS, so we should not ban freedom of wearing and discriminate if certain people makes terrorism in our country who wear Muslim wear."
8576,"I think relative equality is more important than absolute equality. I have a reason. For example, if there were two companies(one earn two million dollar and another earn thousand million dollar) and they had to pay one million for tax, it would be unequal. The former should pay half of their sales but the latter should pay only one percent of their sales. Considering this example, I think relative equality is best way."
8577,"I think so. I think the most important thing is continuing technical innovation. We shouldn't be afraid of new technology and we should use them more than now. If all the work we did will be done by machines, we don't have to work. I think this is good."
8578,I think so. I want this store will be built near my house. Maybe I go there every day.
8579,"I agree with your opinion that is 'But I am paying attention to Mr. Trump who talks about changing the present situation.' But, USA is democratic country and adopts delegate system when it has presidential election. So Clinton won in number of votes , but now Trump will be president. We have to accept this situation and think what to do for better future."
8580,"I think so too. I need this shop near my house. I think it's difficult to judge which is good one ,for example, foods like vegetables. So I like Amazon Go. I can see them directly and judge which is better."
8581,"According this article. the result of election embody people in America just want to change. They were not satisfied with Obama's politics. So they chose a candidate who totally different with Obama. In my opinion, it is nothing to surprise. Of course, I surprised at the time i get the news. But after reading this article and through a thinking to this case. I found that an election to people is a chance to get their own country to change. Whenever which election(past election or future election), it will not be changed. For example, Obama is a big change to America too. Although i like globalization. But i also hope Trump will not make his supporters be disappointed. And make America a better country."
8582,"I agree with you. Global companies like them, they sometimes contribute society for example to do fundraising for African or any other weak people. To pay is one of the good way to contribute society , so I hope them to more tax before fundraising."
8583,"I agree with you. Sometimes we haven't to think so many demerit to the new technology. There will always be some solutions to it. What is important is to make the merit do it best ,make it to the max."
8584,I agree with this opinion. I think the image to President Trump is an aggressive image. I hope that he will be a good president.
8585,I totally agree with you. And i also had a misunderstanding to burkini. I suppose it doesn't make any hindrance to French. And i think they could show more tolerance to different culture.
8586,I'm from the future (15/01/2017). Now the world is confused about the action he TRUMP made like you said. And now people are frightened by the fear of starting war. His words are too violent and too extreme. I'm afraid the future.
8587,"I think so too. Revenge is not good way to solve problem. But , hack becomes world wide and serious problem , a lot of country suffer from Internet's threat. We should more consider to solve hacking among the nations and measure cyber attacks."
8589,I agreed with you. But unfortunately he won the election. His ' MAKE BLIND' plan is succeed. I think we should stop him to take a way like this.
8590,"I think this news is something silly because if we take revenge to someone or something and also it repeats revenge. In other words, we'll only will get nowhere. We should end this meaningless spiral. Also everyone knows that we should protect our privacy. Without permission, we mustn't publish others' personal information. Nowadays I think many people lose the heart which feel compassionate to others."
8591,I agree with him. There are many different thinking and many different people in the world.That is a very interesting thing. I think that it will be a better world if society where people with different opinions can think of each other can do it.
8592,This is a peaceful management. But maybe not so effective.
8593,I agree with him. There are many different thinking and many different people in the world.That is a very interesting thing. I think that it will be a better world if society where people with different opinions can think of each other can do it.
8594,"I agree with you. This 'biggest gamble' is too dangerous for the world. To keep the world peaceful, we shouldn't tolerate his words. Our duty is not to be deceived by words, to pursue correctness."
8595,"I know all athletes want to win the Olympic game and be No.1 in the world, but they should keep in mind that they are representative of their country. Also they bear each country's future. Bad behavior will invite worse situation. I hope all athletes play sports fair and square."
8597,"I disagree with this opinion. Sports is what you do according to the rules, and doping inspection is absolutely necessary. Even if the privacy of the players is infringed, I think that we should do the inspection."
8598,I don't agree with you. In fact multinational companies lead the world. I think too high tax will make them lose their motivation and this will cause the world adverse effect. I think we should tolerance their way.
8599,"I agree with this opinion. Companies that have plenty of money like big companies should pay taxes as much as they can. However, it is difficult to change the policy of the country, so I think that this is a problem of morals of each company."
8600,I agree with you. I think this report in Japan has big problem. They think doping is more worse than leak. Leak and Doping are completely different problem. We should think these problems separately.
8601,"I agree with this opinion. Human life is not something that can be dealt with lightly. To protect public order is important, but life is more important than that."
8602,"I didn't know about the burkini which covers full body before read this news. In addition, I didn't know why this burkini became a big problem. But after read this news, I felt how Japanese people are indifference to religion!!!!! Now globalization is getting wide, we should reconsider our view of religion, especially Japanese should. We must accept others if there is wide gap which doesn't get used to us."
8603,I agree with your opinion. I also want to wear a swimsuit which I like even if it opposes to religion. I think it is certain that we have a right! We shouldn't have to intervene others too much.
8604,"I like Apple's product, too and now I'm typing on Macbook. They should pay appropriate tax because now, like me, many people like and use its products, but someday they would lose confidence in Apple. This will damage its economy and this financial loss will be greater than tax."
8605,"Today, we can get a lot of information through media. It is good and convenient because we can soon understand what is happening in the world. However, on the other hand, there may be some wrong information. We have to judge whether it is right or not. Then, we should master its ability."
8606,"I was interested this news so I watched it on my phone on real-time. I was so surprised because I never thought that Trump became the US president really. Originally I didn't agree with Hillary's policy but I really didn't want Trump to become the president because he discriminate immigrants and assume white person is supreme. His way of thinking is incorrect. Discrimination is worst attitude. I was shocked such a terrible person would be the top of America. But this fact won't be changed, so I hope him become a good president..."
8607,He is good at using SNS and selling himself so I think this brought him win. Also many white people took sides with him. I can't imagine how change the world from now on.
8608,"I was very surprised when I read this article. It is because $179 million is too high. I am not artistic, so I do not have a taste for pictures. Therefore, I think pictures are worthless. So, I do not beggar belief that pictures are sold at a ridiculous price."
8609,"I agree with your opinion. this problem does not have the answer. It is because person's life should be viewed equally each person. However, it is an idealized theory. If I fall into such as situation, I would sell mother or girlfriend down the river. So, I think that this problem is difficult."
8610,"I worry about if robots become more useful and take part in our jobs, how we earn money to live. Still human intelligence prevail robots but I heard that In America two AI came to talk with each other using words we people don't know. This news frightened me. I think shortly robots will prevail us and may govern the world. It is certain that high technology gives benefits to our life but it makes other problems at the same time. I want to catch up the lately news about this."
8611,It is horrible to think about human death.... How do we live if it becomes reality? I can't imagine this. These days I often feel that how ordinary life is happy. We should consider our life in future.
8613,I didn't know about him before read this topic. I was surprised at his point of view. We should inherit his thinking and will. I feel he is great person through reading this news. R.I.P.
8614,"I don't know that Amazon, Starbucks and other multinational companies don't pay much tax in Australia. It is unjust that they do so even though they have significant sales. I think new rules should be made to resolve this problem and to stop widening the gap between the rich and the poor."
8615,"I agree with you. The world is badly confused by the result of the election. The US is having Inauguration ceremony, and many groups are planning demonstrations. This confusion seem to continue for a while, so I will pay attention to Trump's statement and actions of people in the US."
8616,"I can understand not only an opinion of Muslims but also that of French. Of course I know most Muslims are harmless and innocent people. However when I watch the terrible terrorism news, I imagine the worst case. The Muslims just obey religious rule. It is unfair to be infringed the right to go beach. We need the another way Muslims and the others are satisfied."
8617,I disagree with you. I feel afraid of the world where robots do almost all tasks. It seems to be difficult for those who couldn't have received enough education to work for morality and culture. It is a problem that robots deprive labors of all tasks.
8618,"Almost all American who voted for Donald Tramp aimed for a benefit only for themselves.If they consider other countries, such as Japan, Chine and Canada, they should not vote for him because he is not willing to cooperate with other countries at all. And I also feel that Obama was a great president when I saw him fill with tears in the eyes at the last speech in his office. I want America consider the whole world as the biggest country in the world."
8619,"I understand what you want to say. Apparently, the way Duterte deals with drug criminals does not go though democratic formalities and seems inhumane. On the other hand, your idea is highly sophisticated and merciful. However, it cannot be expected to carry out realistically. As he says, there are immeasurable drug criminals and drug crimes prevail all over the Philippines. His way is surely a little bit coarse, but it is certain way to stamp out drug-related crimes completely. Also, we cannot say definitely it doesn't democratic at all since it is supported by the majority of the nation. Therefore, I think his way is admissible, maybe not the best."
8620,I agree with you. Tax saving is a means of business. The results of administrative omission shouldn't be imposed on multinational companies.
8621,"I agree with you. As the proverb goes, Sound in body, sound in mind. I hope Olympics without doping, too."
8622,"I agree with you. He didn't have hatred for the government at all even though he had been treated unjustly. Moreover, he made an effort for protect non-white people, and it had big influence around the world. I respect him very much."
8623,"I am in basic agreement with your comment. But, immigrants should make more effort to integrate themselves into the local community."
8624,"I think Duterte is too radical. Of cause, the narcotics trade should be suppressed strictly, but trying to kill all people involved in the drug trade goes too far. The assailant like this can involve irrelevant people, so it is very dangerous. He should find another way to rid Philippine of illegal drugs. I sometimes hear the news about his violent language. I will continue to pay attention to his news."
8625,"I also cannot believe that a painting has value of about $180 million because I am not familiar with an art. In my opinion, how to use their money completely depends on them, so using such a huge money for a painting has no problem. But I think it is a problem to keep artworks in a dark corner of a private home because it loses an original value of artworks. Artworks which are not watched by only particular persons is equivalent to food which is not eaten by anyone."
8626,"Yes, his true ability as a politician is still unknown. Ironically, however, that's the very reason why we can expect him."
8627,"I agree with you. I think both of them are dangerous persons, but Duterte is much more crazy than Trump."
8628,"I agree with you. Wearing burkini should be guaranteed by nation because what people wear should not be restricted. I sympathize with your comment, 'It's violation of human rights'. People have to accept others who believe in other religion more tolerantly. We have not to treat others according to our prejudice."
8629,"Your view is much to the point. Someday, the time might come when robots hold the family purse strings."
8630,"Athletes should play sports without doping substances, but the hackers should have not leaked Olympic stars' medical because hacking is illegal. Medical files include very private information, so they should be protected by the hackers."
8631,I agree with you. The personal information is very important. We should think another way to find athletes using doping drug.
8632,"I agree with you. In order to Muslim people can follow its faiths and rules, we have to allow them to wear burkini in anywhere. This ban robs them of the rights of freedom of belief and action. There are various people who believe in various religion or have peculiar rules around the world. Ban of burkini is one of the violation of human rights, so if we allow this ban, persecution to minority will increase around the world."
8633,I agree with you. We must accept various ideas. We should not oppress those who believe different religions but respect their rights. The conflict like this is fruitless.
8634,"I also think this question doesn't have answer. First of all, law doesn't have to decide which we must save because lives are all equal. And secondly which we should save depends on how old their mother is or how close to their girlfriend. For example, if the mother is 40 years old and the boy has engaged with the girlfriend, it is reasonable to save a girlfriend."
8635,"I agree with you. Sports players should check the list of restricted drugs in order to play fair. If they use restricted drugs, I think it is because of players careless in the field of sports. However, hacking privacy data is illegal. in any situation, hacking others' privacy and leaking it to the public should be punished."
8636,"I'm looking forward to go 'Amazon Go' someday.When I heard this news, I thought it is something like SF. Anyway, I don't worry about job loss by Amazon Go,because I believe there are many jobs that machine can't do, but I wonder if there will be a computer bug, thief, and any troubles in the store."
8637,"I agree with you. Doping is bad thing because sports players are required to play fairly according to sportsmanship in the field of sports. However, hacking is wrong way to announce doping fact to the public. If the injustice known to the public, people including other athletes feel uncomfortable.I hope hacking not to happen in Tokyo Olympic."
8638,"The system seems to be the future technology. Every customer have get irritated at the time we wait in line. The system of amazon GO changes common sense of shopping. In the article, the system decrease the number of employee of shop, and it is not good. I do not think so, because the people who cannot work at shops work another office. The automatic society must need people who put it in good condition."
8639,"I was very surprised and frightened to read your comment. I haven't been interested very much in such news, but now I want to know more about AI."
8640,I agree with you. We should help the local companies rather than the multinational companies which earn much money. I think multinational companies have duty to pay more tax and contribute to society.
8641,I agree with you. I want him to change his mind to do such terrible thing. We should keep watching what he say and do.
8642,"I am interested in this head line, too. I cannot understand why multinational companies pay less taxes than local stores when I read this headline. I think multinational companies should pay taxes according to their sales. If they continue to pay few taxes, many small companies will go bankrupt and multinational companies will monopolize world economy. i worry about such future."
8643,"I agree with you. Multinational companies are significant for our life and we trust them very much. In order to keep good relationship between multinational companies and customers, they should follow rules and listen to other people's opinion."
8645,Your thought is brand new and innovative. Your idea makes me think that we should not complain but should find a new way to spend a meaningful life.
8646,"I agree with you. It seems to be difficult to solve this problem completely, but it is possible to improve it. In fact, I live in Yokosuka which has a large navy base, but have never feel harm by American base."
8647,"I was surprised at the number of people who use the drugs, too. I think Philippine should have responsibility to this situation. If the nation capture drug users and educate them not to use drugs again instead of killing, the number oh people who uses drugs will decrease. I think it is important to teach how drugs are dangerous in Philippine."
8648,"I sympathize with your opinion,'the good way to punish drag criminals is arresting them, teaching them the drug's bad influence to their bodies and spirits', very much. If nobody teaches people how dangerous drugs are, people cannot notice drugs' bad influence to them and continue to use drugs. For Philippine children and future, Philippine have to make rules about drugs and adults have to stop using drugs."
8649,"I thought this is a very difficult question. As many people says, I also think that the best way is to saving both, and I can't agree of saving girlfriend leads to a criminal failure. Moreover, I thought that the answer of this question will be change if the choice is 'wife' instead of 'girlfriend'. Girlfriend is one of friends but wife is one of family as 'mother' is. We have only one mother and father but also we have only one spousal. As the article says, maybe the problem will change if the question is 'Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first?'. Therefore, I cannot understand why the exam chose the question. The question can create various opinions because there are many similar cases."
8650,"I agree with you. Using and selling drugs are very bad, of course, but Duterte's way to punish people is too radical. Philippine has to think how to get drug users back into society."
8651,"I agree with you. I also think that we should preferentially help the person who can't escape on their own. I believe there are too many opinions in this law and there is no right answer. In addition, you said that women's status in China maybe weak. I thought that this case chose women because women has less power than man. However, the answer will be change in various situations, so I can't say what is correct answer."
8653,"I didn't know how Mr.Nobel was, so I never think he invented dynamite. I was surprised because such a man started the Nobel Prize. In addition, I didn't know about a little-known quartet of groups from Tunisia so I read another article. I was surprised again.Throught this news I can't the definition of the Nobel Prize."
8654,I agree with you. It is important for big company to build a relationship of trust. So they should follow rules.
8655,"I agree with you. Some Muslims are radical and cause terrorism, but most of Muslims are not dangerous, so we should not have prejudice to them and discriminate them. As you said, we have to understand them well."
8656,"I agree with your opinion. Your comment ''With automation, things which humans have to do is decreasing.This deprives us of the pleasure of achieving an objective.'' makes sense."
8659,I also looking forward to seeing how Trump govern the US. Maybe he may become a good president. All things we can do is keep eyes on movements of America.
8660,I think all Muslims are dangerous but I can understand people in Europe feel horrible to them because some of them attacked Europe. It's pity that Muslims who are not related to terrorism are suspected.
8661,I can't agree with your opinion because I think revenges only birth revenges.
8663,"I agree with you. Adding to your proposal, I will propose that we should support rearing with money. Rearing costs us a lot. Many women giving up having children have less money to rear children. To give them bonus, they may be able to rear children."
8665,I did not think of it. There are no people in the store. Thieves can steal goods easily. However this system sounds high technologically. It has superior solution.
8666,"I have a same idea with you. The culture, religion, languages and so on should be protected and respected. It is not acceptable to infringe them."
8667,I think Starbucks and amazon should pay more tax because they earn much money. I can't understand why tax system don't apply them correctly.
8668,I agree with you. Because the company which earn much money should much tax.
8669,"I think so, too. The athletes are just individuals. Their personal data should be protected. The test of doping should be done by only the organization which holds games in rule."
8670,I was shocked when I read this article. I think it's difficult to distinguish the medical that is permitted and dopings.
8671,"After I read your opinion, I thought we should not eliminate all robots,but we should find the way to coexist with robots."
8672,I agree with you. It is nonsense to use illegal measures even for unveiling illegal dopings.
8673,I think so. We should not only take a pessimistic view of this conscience but see carefully his action and what will happen in the world.
8674,I think it's difficult for French people and Muslim women to understand each other. Because Burkina is the symbol of terrorism for French and it is tradition for Muslim women.
8677,I impressed at the same point too. A culture influencing other culture is interesting.
8678,I feel terrible about the result of the election of new president. He wasn't regarded as qualified by American people but he won. So we should be more careful about politics.
8679,I agree with you. I hope he changed his stance.
8680,"I don't agree with you. When illegal measures are permitted,the law system cannot work."
8682,"I am surprised at innovations of technology. It is unimaginable that the shop which is no resisters in a previously. Admittedly, increased automatization steal job from human. But it also create new job. Besides, if the rate of unemployment would be increased because of automatization, I think that it is what is called the capitalism."
8683,"I agree with you. Sometimes we haven't to think that there are so many disadvantage points of new technology. There will always be some solutions to it. What is remarkable is to make the merit do it best ,make it to the max."
8684,"I want to use Amazon go service. It decreases the stress for consumer. Although there is risk of vanishing humans jobs, it will give us more comfort."
8685,"I agree with your opinion in most part. Surely, it is a good thing for consumers that the price goes down. However, amazon go could deprive of the employee opportunity for other in contrary. In spite of the writer's remark that said there is a job which only human being can do, amazon go will definitely increase the unemployment rate. We should consider the balance between convenience and unemployment more deeply."
8686,"I think this idea has many good points.But the contrary,also has bad aspects. Good aspects are Amazon Go is very convenient and available system, futuristic . What is more,Amazon Go can reduce in personnel expenses, so it is a dreamlike system.On the country, there is a risk that to prosper only Amazon and other large companies, subsidiary and affiliated company will bankruptcy.And if too spread this system, it is a possibility to be employ fewer people and come profitable stagnation. So I strongly oppose Amazon Go . I think that to have a few shops is good for encouragement ,but Amazon should not to do large scale deployment."
8687,I impressed by your opinion. Waste of money may be going to be big problem.
8691,I think so. multinational Companies should contribute to our society by paying taxes because they earn a lot of money.
8692,I agree with this comment. Nobody can expect that Trump was chosen the US President. I do not know why he was elected even though his speech was too violent and he discriminated . But now we have to accept this situation and we have to think about our future with that President. I hope the US and Japan continue to have good relation ship.
8694,"I agree with this comment. In the world, there are a lot of people who have many kind of religions. We must accept other people who have another religions."
8696,"I agree with you. The drugs should not be accept. To save country, we should enforce them."
8697,"I agree with you. This system is so interesting to me . Though this system is uneasiness, it is good to prevent to steal. These days, the number of stealing is increasing. So, this system is convenient."
8699,"I agree with you. America have big effect on all world. Many people say Trump is so bad to become president. However, Clinton have a lot of problems. So, I do not know whether Clinton or Trump is good. I want to see carefully what is happening now and will happen in the future."
8700,I agree with this opinion. Many people have a lot of different thinking. It's only natural that someone's idea differ from the other's idea.We must accept other people who have another religions.
8701,"I have heard this new before and I really liked this idea because, as this article says, Amazon go will save shopping time. I think, once you come up with innovative ideas, trying to realize them is important."
8702,"I agree with your opinion. It is so bad to hack. However, first of all, leaking privacy is so bad.p This problem ought to be left to the 'sportsmanship' of the players."
8703,"I think that doping is very bad thing. It is inconsistent with sportsmanship.However,it is not a good enough reason for invading our privacy.The secret of privacy should be protected."
8704,I have never heard this news and I think this system is very interesting and convenient. The latest progress of scientific technology is really wonderful. I hope our life will be better by improving that technology.
8705,"I agree with you. Multinational companies made a fortune. These days,the difference between rich and poor will increase. We have to solve this problem. So I agree with Kern's opinion"
8706,I was surprised to hear the news. I don't want to Trump to become the president because his thought is descriminatory.So I'm very worry about relationship between US in the future.I would like to pay attention act and statement from now on.
8707,"I agree with the idea. I think his way of thinking is incorrect. And discrimination is worst attitude,too."
8708,"I was surprised to read this article. Certainly,taking restricted drug should be blamed and penalized. So,Duterte has been taking severe actions against those who take restricted drugs. However,I think this action against them is extreme."
8709,"right. my former opinion was just an idealistic theory. however, real economy is not on such a simple theory. so, we should think about proper balance between capitalism and social equality."
8710,"I agree with you. In the world, there are various thoughts about religions. We should accept such as these thoughts and think it deeply."
8711,I was impressed with your comment because I didn't know you had such a great thought.
8712,I was shocked to read this article. I can't agree with Duterte's policy.I think this action is too strict and unmorality. But Duterte is very popular in Philippine.This situation is very abnormality.I think Philippine should go back to being a country under the rule of law.
8714,"I agree with you. It is natural that taking drug is wrong action. However,i think that there are more good action to penalize those who take drugs."
8715,I agree with you.Many people all over the world have a lot of thinking. And people should admit some differences.
8716,"In my opinion, that law students were told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime is absurd. All people's lives are equal.I think this kind of question is a bad question."
8717,"I am in favor of Duterte.Surely his statements and remarks are radical.And there are both people all over the world who are for Duterte and against Duterte. He hates drugs and give heavy punishment to someone who use and sell drugs.Surely who is related with drugs claims Duterte is like a devil, but almost good citizens feel happy that Philippine became better without drugs.I agree with Duterte and his policy."
8718,I thought that this system had no effect. But I was satisfied with your opinion. Surely it prevents stealing products.
8720,"I agree with you. Not dressing such a costume, we can show at least our sincerity. The effect of the result of the election is very big for our lives. So, we should be sincere when we vote."
8721,"I was surprised by this article. I often use Starbucks and Amazon. I think that the big companies should pay more taxes than small companies. However, it is not good to force countries to do so, because each countries should be left in their financial policies."
8722,"I was very surprised when I knew this news. It is true that using drug is wrong thing, but, his action is too brutal. I think those who is not involved drug may be killed.So, he should find another action. I think the people who involved drug should be sent to prison, and investigate the people."
8723,"I was surprised to hear this news. Because the number of people who use the drugs. I have an image of drugs as harmful. His method is violent,so many people may disagree with him. However,it is the truth that this way can reduce the number pf people who use drugs."
8724,I'm so impressed with your opinion. I always thought Multinational companies should pay more taxes. The reason why it is not equal. So I think your idea is great. 'Saving tax is one of business' that's right. Your opinion give me a new point of view.
8726,I was surprised to hear this news.Duterte tries to decrease the number of drug cminals.I think that is good thing for philippine.But I think his way that does not hesitate to kill drug criminals.Because I have studied criminal law at Keio University.So I think criminal law is especially limited by the constitution.And that president like Duterte gives punishment freely must not forgive.Therefore I want to watch Duterte and Trumps statements from now.
8727,"I agree with this comment.Dorping should not forgiven. However hacking is illegal and people should not allow this act. And,I think the problem ought to be left to the 'sportsmanship' of the players,too."
8729,I agree with you. I was surprised this result too. But we should accept this result because complaining won't make any progress.
8731,"I was shocked to hear this news.I don't agree to Russian hackers.I guess it was a Russian revenge for the punishment for doping. Many Russian athletes cannot join in Rio Olympics, but this is not wrong. I think all the sports players should be fair and they should not use drugs. Actually doping should not be allowed, so we must keep to the regulations."
8732,I agree with you. I think his policies are going to make the situations worse by polarizing Americans.
8733,"I was surprised when I read this article. I did not know this fact. It is economical problem, so it is difficult problem.But we should consider this problem. My opinion is that big companies should pay more tax than small companies. Recently, Modern economical situation is not good.So, they should help each other."
8734,"I agree with you. And more, we will be in worse situation by the problem of declining birth rate. We have to tackle both economy problem and environmental problem. This is because as well as economy, to restore environment is very hard work."
8736,"When I read this article, i was very surprised. I think candidates have to wear 'appropriate ' clothes . That's because if they do not wear clothes which is appropriate to the election, people cannot respect them."
8737,"I agree this comment. people should not kill someone, even if people do bad things. But it is very difficult problem.So I think we must consider another way,too."
8739,"I was surprised to read this article. Most people didn't want Trump to become the president of US. So,the result of the election did surprised so many people. And also it caused not only international problems but also economic problems. These problems are very serious. We should rethink the relationship between Japan and US."
8740,"I agree with your opinion.Personal information,especially athletes' information should be kept secret. It should never be revealed to the Internet. And Hacker should not do such a thing."
8741,"I agree with you. This is really unique and useful system. However, we can imagine jobless future at the same time. In my opinion, technology is automating so many jobs and that is what people want, and automation of low level jobs is going to continue. So we better start asking some questions about this problems while we can."
8742,"When I read this article,I was very surprised. Starbucks and Amazon are very famous companies.So these companies have a lot of money.Therefore, I think that they should pay more tax than other companies."
8744,"felt sad read this article first. Because ,I think people all over the world respect other cultures and religions.And I think women also have a right to wear some swimsuits which they like even if it show their religion or thinking. But I am not a victim of terrorism , so probably I can not go into the feelings of people who are frightened."
8745,"Thank you. I'm glad that you agree with me. If there are many people like you, we will be able to live in harmony. 'I hope someday you'll join us And the world will be as one ' -John Lennon"
8746,I completely agree with you. I think this is amazingly innovative idea. But we need to prepare for the joblessness.
8748,"I feel regrettable to hear at this news first. It is very terrible to kill many people, even if do bad and illegal thing. I want to find another good way to solve this problems."
8749,"I agree with you. At first, I thought Philippine president let drug sellers be killed is too heavy. However In Philippine the number of crime of drug is increasing."
8751,I agree with you. I'm also wondering how the store is going to prevent thefts.
8753,'What is Muslim wear? What is ISIS's costume?'. This question is difficult question for many Japanese. We don't understand most of the culture of them. Japanese are no too interested in other country. This is a big problem.
8755,"I was surprised when I read this article. It is true that doping is bad thing. But , from point of view of privacy cyber attack should be criticized. Recently, cyber attack tend to be complex problem. I can not say that the other side is wrong. So, we should consider this problem deeply and solve completely."
8756,"I have known that many Japanese car companies are making self-driving car but I didn't know that Google are making it too. Google is not a car company but I know that Google is a one of the biggest internet company, thus I thought this article is very important. In addition, I am relieved that Google are not going to let its self-drive cars into the market 'until they're safe. I can't image self-driving car are on the road, but I am looking forward. I wish it will be no car accidents by using self-driving car in the future."
8757,I was surprised when Trump won the election.The result of the election will have many bad influence on the world. His policy and statement is extreme. I cannot feeling uneasy about the future of Japan.
8759,I agree with you. We and governments should try to decrease the number of people who want to commit suicide.
8760,"I agree with you. I suppose that we need enough surplus to be generous. If there are enough jobs money house food and so on, those Europeans will be able to accept our diversity."
8761,"When I read this article,I realized that I was ignorant of religious rules. There are many people in the world. It is natural to exist many different ideas.I think it is important for us that we accept foreign culture,and have a good understanding of religions."
8762,I agree with this comment. I supported Clinton. And I also had heard criticism of Obama's cowardly attitude before Trump won. I want one day almost all American will accept Trump.
8763,"I agree with you. Many people who don't know the bad influence of Abenomics should know it. As well as you, before I do actions, I want to reconsider about them carefully."
8764,"I don't think so. As the article says, Google is saying that they will not let its self-drive cars into the market until they're safe. I believe this words, thus I think there will be no accidents by the self-driving car. If self-driving car became popular in the future, I think road will be safe and car will be more easy transportation."
8765,I agree with you. The only way to get rid of doping is to be a good person.
8766,"I agree with you. Because of no religion, we Japanese must be more careful about religion."
8767,"I was very surprised to know the result of the American election. I believe that Ms.Clinton would win. I think we should reconsider the relation between Japan and America. American economy is not good now. Trump say that America is not world police. So, Japan may be exposed the danger of the attack from North Korea. The result of the election is not only American problem. It has many effect on the worldwide."
8768,I'm a user of Apple's product too. This news is shocking for us. However I have different idea with you. I think they don't have to pay more tax. Because modern capitalism depend on them.
8769,I was surprised about the result of the election too. I worry about Trump's policy.I think his policy will be opposed by a lot of people.
8770,"I think so. I think it is very good things that ways of thinking differ from person to person,too. It is important for us that we deepen our understanding of difficult cultures."
8772,I don't agree with the automation. It is because It is difficult for people to get job. I think we should more respect human job. Recently there are many people who can't get job.
8773,I agree with you. I also think wearing burkini should not be banned. Because burkini has no connection with terrorism or Islam.I think all the people in the world have a right that they can wear clothes they want to.
8774,"I agree with you. Multinational companies made innovative product. These days,the income-difference between rich men and poor men is increasing. We have to solve this problem. And multinational companies should become more cooperative in order to Reduce the differences"
8775,I agree with you. Discussing by all the country is very important for the globalization age. And continuing discussing and updating common recognition.
8776,"I agree with your opinion. I think that sportsmanship should be protected,so doping is very bad things. However,it is not reason for invading their privacy."
8777,I agree with you. I think sportsmanship is the most important thing. We should think the problem of doping till Tokyo Olympic.
8778,"I was surprised to know the news. It is true that terrorism is dangerous, but we should not relate race to terrorism. we should more understand other culture."
8779,I completely agree with you. Exciting such an unfair system itself is illegal and we should deal with it immediately.
8780,I agree with your opinion.. I think sportsmanship is very important. We should think the problem of doping till Tokyo Olympic.
8781,I agree with your opinion. I did not know about this article before I read it. Many people should know this fact.
8783,"I impressed by your comment about changing voting systems. The problem of voting systems is also occurred in Japan called as inequality in the value of an individual vote. I think ID1604's opinion is a good idea, but it's not sure if there is a candidate who really wants to change the voting systems."
8784,"I agree with you. By the way, I was thinking that we who disagree such discrimination was right. However now I have a question. Why do we disagree? All comments say 'They have right to wear burkini, and we must not ban their actions.'"
8785,I agree with you. Duterte's way is too strict. He should find another better way to punish criminals. And I suppose he should kill both of selling and using drugs people.
8786,"I agree with you., I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows, and so on."
8787,"I agree with you. Also,I was surprised at that you had already known this news before you read it. It seems to be difficult to prevent stealing, however, I hope it will work out successfully."
8788,I agree with you. To cut the labor costs is good for some companies but it will have some bad sides.
8789,"I think that it is very difficult problem. Admittedly, I understand French citizen's argument. I also feel fear, if terrorist live by my house. But I think that we have to counteract terrorism together."
8790,I agree with you. I hope Philippine became 'not narco state'.
8791,I impressed at the same point too. Your opinion is great.
8792,"I really want to use this store too, I cannot wait going shopping there."
8793,"I think so, too. It is difficult to steal any goods because of high security."
8794,"There are so many and various thoughts in the world. It's difficult to understand other people's thought, however, it is the most important thing to keep the world peaceful."
8795,I think burkini may has no danger to people in France.
8796,I think so too. I really want him to reconsider his crackdown and to think the importance of human rights.
8797,"I think so too. In Tokyo Olympic, we, and Japanese government have to make it having nothing to do with doping."
8798,"I agree with you. Although it seems difficult, we should make Tokyo Olympics to be 'clean Olympic' which is nothing to do with doping."
8799,"Structural unemployment is an inherent part of any economy, but the mistake you are making is that the jobs that exist now are the only jobs that can or will exist, and therefore the loss of some industries means the destruction of total number of jobs available. However, our society has grown technologically a lot over the past few hundred years, and yet we always seem to find stuff for people to do in exchange for money. The destruction of some jobs as a result of technological progress facilitates the creation of new ones. The struggle for good government is to ensure that people can have access to the resources to match up with those jobs."
8800,I partly agree with you. Russian government should work more strictly about this problem.
8801,Many Japanese is said to lose their kanji skills in the article. I think so too. I sometime cannot write kanji which I want. I think that it is need to make children write kanji hardly .
8802,"Oh, I couldn't think that possibility of your opinion! 'Amazon Go' protects products by high security, so it is good thing."
8803,French's fear is more than ours against terrorism. We should strive to understand .
8804,"I agree with you. It could become a meaningful job, however, in this case, it seems to be that he just invade athletes' privacy."
8805,I agree with this comment. I think this idea is very good. Japan should use this traffic light.
8806,I think so too. Especially I want to use on a busy morning.
8807,What the hacker did seems to be just invading athletes' privacy. I think it can't be allowed when think about athletes whose privacy was exposed.
8808,i agree with your opinion. Robots have merits and demerits for both of companies and customers. So we should lean to automation in part and make good relation to them.
8809,I agree with you. France has had more terrorist attacks than many European nations. Those attacks have been by people who reject western values. Burkini is very visible symbols of the rejection of western values. So it makes sense to ban on wearing burkini.
8810,"I agree with you. Like you, I did not know the fact and I thought multinational companies paid much more so I was really surprised."
8811,"I agree with you. We should talk about robots' advance more and rapidly, otherwise we would be lost our jobs."
8812,I agree with you. Automatic society is so cool. But in this society will not need human power. So the robot rebellion occurs. Likes SF.
8813,"When I heard that Trump won by the news, I was very surprised too. I had expected Clinton would won because Trump's pledges were too extreme. But now to consider why he was elected as president, I think of a reason. I think a lot of Americans were unsatisfied by their recent lives and want changes. He could attract such people, especially middle-class Americans. His pledges look beneficial to only America, for example the oppression against immigrants. On the other hand, Clinton's campaign promises were good but lack of novelty, and people chose the unpredictable ones. However, his pledges are selfish and it is necessary to consider things world widely. So I 'm afraid of the effect the new president will bring."
8814,"I agree with you. 'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.' This can't solve the problem essentially. Russian way is not good , I think like you."
8815,I agree with this comment. America maybe change greatly. We have to pay attention move of America.
8816,"I think so, too. Technology make our lives convenient, but sometimes it is dangerous. We should not depend too much on the machine."
8817,"The system against stealing is definitely obscure. At the same time, there is a problem about jobless future. This system is great but we can't say this is perfect system."
8818,"I think so too. When we get convenient, we must think threat of jobless."
8819,"I was very surprised when I heard Trump's winning. I thought that Clinton should be the next president. When I read this article, I was shocked at third paragraph. Many of Americans think that Trump is not qualified for the president. Despite no qualify, Americans elected Trump. I cannot understand what is American think."
8820,I agree with this comment. I think multinational company should follow their countries tax regulation.
8821,"In my point of view, I reckon the most important thing is not to find fault with the guiltless plain folk who just have similar clothing with the terrorists. It is obvious that the IS is a quite dangerous group to all over the world, but the censure for the group should not raised up the whole Mohammedanism."
8822,"I have a opinion that is nearly yours. We can wear whatever clothing we like, it is same at Muslim women. We should not ban freedom of wearing not have discrimination whatever who are wearing."
8823,"This is very important opinion. Internet spread all over the world now, so everyone can read any informations, that is whether true or not. And now, the information have stayed here long time. That negatively affect to stars or Olympians long time; worst case, till the end of life. It is unacceptable."
8824,I agree with you. I strongly think it is necessary to have a guardian.
8825,"I agree with you. It is very difficult problem, I reckon. In the end, what we need to reconsider is the system of EU states with low-tax regimes that have lured multinationals."
8826,"I think so, too. Most Japanese could not expect the Presidential result of the State. I think Trump is too violent. I hoped that Clinton became the President. However, he won the election and became the President of the State. So, we should hope he will be a good President for all the American and should think better way of the relation between Japan and U.S."
8827,"I disagree with this comment. Whatever the number of crime decrease, Duterte's crackdown is crime. I think hatred make hatred, so this way can not follow."
8828,"I totally agree with you. Of course doping can't be allowed, however, it also can't be allowed to invade other person's privacy."
8829,"I agree with you. Off course I understand Russian hacker's feeling against doping, but the illegal way is unacceptable. I think we should show the attitude to eliminate doping. We should make the Olympic more fair."
8830,"I was shocked when I heard this new. I think this solution is not solution. Duterte is very popular in Philippine, but this way is very Inhumanity. He should protect people by other way."
8831,"I agree with , I think that we don't have to kill them. We have to think another better ways in order to get them back into society."
8832,Big company should pay much tax. They must move economy.
8833,"Your idea is very good. U.S. has a great power for all around the world. I have a sense of danger about his politics. I hope that he does not do the thing which destroy the peace of the world. We, not American, should be careful about his action."
8834,I was shocked when I read this news. Confidential informations are so important and everyone does not want to known them. But doping is not good. Russian track and field players can not participate in Rio Olympic for doping. I think this problem is serious. So I hope that Olympic Committee find solution.
8835,I agree with you. I did not hear this news. Banning photos without moral is good idea.
8836,"I agree with you. We should try to get rid of the difference between rich and poor. If everyone is happy with money, the rate of crime will decrease."
8837,I think so..So I feel this e difference of recognition about tax between in Japan and in America .
8839,"I was shocked by this news. Because, Starbucks is my favorite company. It is very popular, so it has economical power. It pay money instead of customer. Also applies to Amazon."
8840,"Oh, I agree with you. I think this measure is too strict too."
8841,"I am expecting trump's poltic.His opinion is so radical, and some people think he will cause bad influence on the world.However, he will make changes many ways. For example, the relationship between Japan and U.S.A will become new and I think we need change to develop our country for future.We accept this election favorably."
8842,"Your idea is good, but terrorism is very dangerous. Now, in the world, too many people is killed by terrorist. This problem is very serious. It is important to understand various culture and religions. However, it is also important to save lives. We should think about these two thing."
8843,"I agree with your opinion. The technology is developing in rapid speed today. In order to secure our jobs, we have to find the things that is impossible for robot and only people can do. Like you said, warmth is such thing. However, robots are threat to humans and I worry about the world that is ruled by robots."
8844,"I agree with your opinion.I think it is because of players careless in the field of sports. However, hacking privacy data is illegal. in any situation, hacking others' privacy and leaking it to the public should be punished."
8845,"I have same hope with you as an sports fan. We should not accept doping and make impartial Olympic. Then, let's enjoy the Tokyo Olympic with all friends!"
8846,I agree with you. It is bad that French authorities think religious or culture problem is out of hand. They should accept and respect that.
8848,"I think the U.S. is known as a country which is economically large but extremely capitalized. So the gap between the rich and the poor is so big and becoming more and more bigger. If the multi national companies like Amazon and Starbucks' pay more and more taxis, our lives would be a little more comfortable than now. I hope they will do but maybe they won't."
8849,I agree with you. We should find a peaceful way to solve the problem between countries. I think it is useless to use military force to solve the problem.
8850,"I also be surprised at the first time I read the article. And persisted Duterte is a cruel person. But actually in Philippine, people like Duterte very much. Most of the citizen support him. They think he is changing Philippine be a better and stronger country. We can't ignore this. But i also want to say, the way like this is too rude and deny the human rights. I suppose there will be some better management to solve the problem."
8851,Thank you for your reply. we should know many thoughts and think about other religions carefully.
8852,I think it is not forgiven too. The reason is why it's personal data. And also your idea which Wada should check athletes drugs using more strictly in order to avoid the accident like this news is great I think.
8853,I think it is individual freedom. And also think same sex marriage should be legal. Same sex couple just love each other so I don't want them to give up to get marry because of the gender.
8854,"I think that Doping is unacceptable thing, and private things must be protected. It is difficult thing, but I think there are other ways for solving this problem. Olympic Committee faces very big wall."
8855,I totally agree with you. Such behavior is not like a modern one.
8856,I agree with French treatment for Muslim. Recently ISIS is threat of all over the world. They are radical and cruelties. And France was also targeted. Terror has occurred in Paris. So I understand that French people become sensitive. I hope that this issue will converge soon.
8857,"Thank you for your reply. In the world, there are so many thoughts about religions and we don't know most of these. We should be more interested in other religions."
8858,Thanks for the reply. I was impressed with your opinion. We must be seen to EU states.
8859,"I think so, too. The negative campaign is always done in the US election. Bunt I do not think that it is good for democracy."
8861,I agree with your opinion.We should accept this situation.
8862,We have the right not to be known any information about us. It doesn't matter whether it is involved in any criminals. So this hacking should be more criticized.
8863,I agree with your comment. I can understand Americans were not satisfied with stagnant society and hope changes.But I feel this selection of American is too selfish. I hope that world peace will continue too.
8864,I partly agree with you. Multinational companies earn so much money and they should do something back to the society.
8865,Thank you for your reply. Drug is the thing that can't be accepted. The government should all things that can be done to save country.
8867,I think so too. Because differences from others is very important.
8868,I agree with you. Many people have various ideas and various way of thinking. Everyone should accept them to prevent the conflicts.
8869,He has a negative effect on the world. All we do not allow his domineering. We should think many things more carefully and not to forget think about our future.
8870,"It is very dangerous, so I hope not to break out any world war, and also I hope Trump wouldn't take an action by purchasing America's profit."
8871,"Your idea is good. All the people in any culture and religion have a right to wear they like, but terrorism is very dangerous. We should defend the terrorism to save our lives. We should think this problem from the two aspects."
8872,I surprised at the first time too. And i agree with your opinion that praising the European Commission's ruling that Apple should pay up to €13bn in taxes plus interest to Ireland.
8873,Thank you for your comment. I was at first surprised at your comment. I hope the world won't go to have war like WWⅡ...
8875,"I think terrorism problem is very difficult. In Paris, people fear of terrorism."
8876,"Thank you for your reply. Yes, I' m so interested in Trump's politics."
8877,"I was shocked this news. Religion's problem is very difficult, so I can't answer clearly. If possible ,however, Interfaith dialogue should be held. I think it is best way for peace."
8878,I agree with you. I also want to see carefully what is happening now and will happen in the future. And I expect Abe to have good relationship with him and keep peace in both country.
8879,"I also feel shocked when I heard this news. People who are innocent should not be killed. If there is no evidence, no one should be punished."
8880,"Improving technology such as robotics is necessary and we get profit.However I'm worry about losing jobs in furture.Also it is a time to hard finding employment, so We should using robotics to recover economy and create more jobs.In addition this some traditional jobs cannot be replaced for automation.These precious job should be protected for future."
8881,"The last day, I did shopping online. It was a little expensive and I considered again and again buying or not. If it becomes more easily to buy everything from foods to cars online, we would make our sense of money confused and buy a lot of things we don't need. It means we will be hard to live a life. To be useful also means that It is sometimes dangerous."
8882,Your perspective to this news is different from others. And I totally approve your opinion about this. I also worry about Japanese politics. But i hope there is no problem.
8883,"Thank you for your comment. As you said, I think artificial intelligence can not obtain human heart and human emotions which are accumulated for a long time have value."
8884,I was impressed with your comment because I didn't know you had such a great thought.
8886,"I was very surprised when I heard this news. However, he is business specialist, so his economical policy is very good. So, from the economical point of view, He will make the U.S.A great again."
8887,I was surprised that Trump won. But I think Trump is better than Clinton. Trump's remarks are radical. So I think he is different successive president. Also he was an excellent real estate agency. I would like to expect economic policy. I wish for his good luck.
8888,"At the fist time, I was surprised by this news. I just though how rude is this president! But after I read the news for the second time. I found that we should admit the severity of this problem. So that it do should be taken some strict measures. However, President Duterte is overstrict i think. Maybe it could be punished by closed in prison for many years or forever. But not be killed. Lives is much more precious than Duterte think I suppose. It refers to the issue of human rights. In my opinion, a criminal's basic rights should also be respected."
8889,"I agree with his comment! Leaking private information is never forgiven. In all sports competition, athlete must be equal but when they use drugs, they enhance the performance. It was unfair. If i were the athlete i do not want to win with using drugs."
8890,"I think these big company should contribute to our society. So, the gap between the rich and the poor should be small. I think this idea is very good."
8891,I agree with you. They should build a friendship.
8893,Your opinion is great. I don't like to line up for just a thing. It is like a revolution.
8894,"I am opposed to Trump's plan that bans Muslims immigrations. This is because as a candidate, his statement was so thoughtless. It is true that people are afraid of terrorism all over the world, but blocking all Muslims from entering the United States can't be a drastic measure and can't stops terrorism. In addition to that, Muslims are not always those who bring about terrorism. So Trump's idea should not be carried out, I think."
8895,"It's very difficult problem. I know they are too sensitive about what Muslim women wear at a the beach. However I thought when French people see burkini, they may remind the terrorism at Paris. I want to think about how people respect for other's religions each other."
8897,I agree with your argue. I think that multinational companies should contribute to our society not only paying tax but also donation.
8898,"I agree with his comment. Recently illegal downloading is very popular ,so the sales of CDs are declining. people love music but they have to buy them. Illegal downloading makes the artist very upset so i never forgive the pirates items."
8899,"Maybe I think Americans get impatient. They need a really 'Change'. Obama said 'Change' many times but their life didn't change. They think Obama's peace way can't solve the problem and they need more power to change. Then appearing TRUMP, he has big company, money and Power. What trump has is that the Americans need. So they chose him I think."
8900,I am a heavy user of Amazon. Because it is quick and convenient. So I agree all of Amazon service.But I'm worry about losing jobs in the future. I think roboticization is good. But too roboticization is not good.
8901,I think so. We wait for the Tokyo Olympic. We pray no players will not violate them during the Tokyo Olympics.
8902,"Thank you for your comment. If more people have many kind of religions, this problem which about burkini and so on are not happen."
8903,"This opinion is very interesting. It is difficult to decide which is the best way, machine-controlled store or human-controlled store. However, security is one of the most important problems in the store management, and machine-controlled store may be able to decrease the workers. That means they can decrease human errors. That's why, it is nice idea I think."
8904,"The gap between rich people and poor people is not good in Japan. We should reconsider the system of capitalism carefully. In addition, energy problem is serious in the world. This is a worldwide problem, and not only the rich countries but also the poor country discuss and work on together. International cooperation is also important."
8905,"You opinion is great but human are the animals which is originally greed. If I had to chose something for us, Japan or China, I will definitely choose our country first."
8906,Thank you for your comment. we can't even judge the person is fat or not because that is the thing should be personally considered.
8907,"I was surprised by this news. It was so cruel terrorism however, French government should not ban Muslims culture.I think this act can be said bowing terrorism and terrorists will may be puffed up and other accidents may happen."
8908,I think so too. It is rational that companies should pay tax according to their sales. It is nice idea.
8909,"I was surprised when I know this news. It will not take place in Japan. Star Wars is popular in Ukraine, so costume of Star Wars is suitable to attract attention. However I think that they should follow a law. The politician should give the nation security."
8910,I agree with you. I hope Olympics without doping.
8911,"Thank you for your reply. I think if many people accept other religions, the number of war will decrease."
8912,"Thank you for your reply. This head line is so good. Yes, I worry about that too. We should think about many small companies. And claim multinational companies like Starbucks to pay more tax."
8913,Thanks for your comment. They should follow the rules of doping for playing games fairly and keeping our personal informations. I hope Tokyo Olympic is held without unfair games.
8914,I agree with you. Your opinion is so good way.
8915,"Certainly, I think the Nobel Peace Prize is becoming the thing only for the name when I read this article. Only the efforts in moving the North African country towards democracy cannot solve the all problems. We have to decide the range of it, and raise the standard up. If we can do it, the Nobel Peace Prize will become the thing which Alfred Nobel wished."
8916,"I do not think trump is a kind president but he can be the good leader. Sometimes he says many violent words and discriminates . But his determination is very fast and clear. The good leaders are not kind. Little Kindness makes the determination slower. So , people say Trump is very cruel and I am afraid what is going on with Trump' s plan , but i think he can be a good leader."
8917,Thank you for your comment. All we can do is to hope Trump will be a proper person for American President.
8918,"I'm very interested in this news. Amazon Go is very convenient so, I will go there every day. However, I am worried about employment issue. So, Japanese should Be cautious about Amazon Go."
8919,I understand your opinion that this shop makes rise of rate of unemployment. But I think that it is also the capitalistic economy. And the Amazon Go is also create new job like system engineer.
8920,I think your opinion is so good. I think Russian government's behavior is not the perfect action to doping the problem too.
8921,"I think so too. Using an illegal drug is bad, so it is necessary to control drugs. But Duterte's behavior is wrong."
8922,"It's difficult problem to solve whether for US troops to stay in Okinawa or to move away from Okinawa. It's heavy burden for Okinawa and people in Okinawa ask US troops to move away. However, Okinawa is important place strategically. Especially, advance of China prove a great menace of Japan. We should think over this problem."
8923,"I think everyone should play the competition on sportsmanship and never do such a fraud.This fact must be disappointed for many sport fans.In addition,this doping cause losing international trust not only for sport. I hope it will never happen sad news like this."
8924,I agree with you. The right of privacy is very important.
8925,"Thank you for your comment. I think if many people accept other religions, this issue like ban wear burkini will not happen."
8926,I agree with you. I think 'clean Olympic' is very good word.
8927,"I was surprised to read this article. I don't familiar with art , so I can't understand why some people buy the work of art for such a too expensive price. However, I guess that they can't understand our way of using money."
8928,I think so too. I think that Duterte's behavior is very aggressive and rough.
8929,I think so too. Japanese should be cautious about new system
8931,"Thank you for your comment. I think so,too.They should follow the rules not to collapse economics systems and to do market competition freely."
8932,"Autonomous car was imaginary technology when I was a child. But today,the fantasy is realizing and we can see the car moving with AI through the Internet.Today's advance of technology is very fast and some people are enjoying such situation,but others are struggling to catch up with it. I think that to consider problems that this current of the times may cause is important ."
8933,"This news gave me a great impact.That is because guns can be produced by 3D printer. It is amazing and dangerous. If everyone can use 3D printer, this world will filled with weapons. I'm so worry about this."
8934,"I was surprised that the incident was occurred until quite recently because I never read such news. Though it is clear that a policy of immigration in Japan has been made slow progress, I didn't imagine that the circumstances was so severe. Japan is a nation which is exclusive to foreigners for a long time and the fact hasn't been improved much. Maintaining of national traits is good, but the government had better tolerate as much as possible."
8935,I agree with you. Protecting athletes' health is most important job for the government. Leaking medical files or doping should be punished. The government issue a warning if athletes use some medical drugs.
8936,"I think so, too. Japanese should be cautious about new system."
8937,"I read the article with great surprise. It is sad that, they are not proud of their national flag. I noticed that I am happy because I like the national flag of Japan the best in all national flags. 'Hinomaru' is very simple, and can be drawn easily so I think it is a great design."
8938,"I was surprised that such misconduct has occurred that some days aren't passed when the Minister of Economy changed. Ms. Obuchi resigned by being suspended that she has a funding scandal. When government elect the next Minister, I wonder why Abe Prime Minister didn't research the people who properly became a candidate. In the process of researching, government must find that the local secretary of Miyazawa had put out the unnecessary political activity costs. I thought it was really not have been made firmly ."
8939,I agree with your opinion. People who takes restricted drug is so criminal and unforgiven but his action is too strict.
8940,"I also thought very sad, but imagine if the terror was happened in the area which you are living. Can you really mind to be calm?"
8941,"I was shocked by this news. Because Duterte's decision is too strict at all. His mind of worrying his country is understandable and drug should not be permited.But, no need to killing.There must be some other taken way, such as penal servitude or heavy fine."
8944,"Self-driving cars will bring some benefits, such as reducing the number of traffic accidents and more efficient use of roads and parks. However, we should not believe the security of self-driving cars absolutely. It is possible for this new technology to cause traffic accidents. I'm afraid that people believe this security absolutely and come to pay little attention to situations. It is necessary not to forget to take care of situations when taking self-driving cars."
8945,"Thank you for your answer! I think to revise constitution is better way that doing hate crime against Trump. For me, it is a good way to ask the United States federal courts about the justice of the election. I don't know much about American law system, however the election may be judged it is invalid."
8946,I agree with you. Rich people should not monopolize such valuable arts but help them not to spoilt and taken over our children and next generation by donating a lot of their money.
8950,I agree with you. We must accept various ideas. And we have to know various culture. I think these action lead to understanding each other.
8951,I agree with you. This problem is difficult. Because it Involved in public safety. So I think It can not be helped strict action.
8952,I think cutting the personnel expenses is good. But there is no communication and human relations. So I think government have to stop too roboticization.
8953,"When I read this article, I was surprised. Why these companies do not contribute society. This fact is so unfair."
8956,I agree with you.Relying too much on robotics cause many problems. We should consider how we treat convenient technology.
8957,I agree with your opinion. We need to improve our creative skills.
8958,"I think so too. We are too nervous this swimwear, and it can be stoking anxiety over terrorism. We should accept this culture with consideration."
8959,"I agree with your opinion.If people understand difference of cultures well, they will treat each others gently.Finaly, I hope no government treats with religious culture unfairly."
8960,"I was impressed your opinion. Actually, human rights should not be limited by governments, so no one must be banned what they want to wear. In addition, wearing burkini is not linked directly for terrorism."
8961,"I agree with your opinion. Certainly, athletes compete as fairly, but leaking illegal way must be punished."
8962,I think so too. These hacker should be punished.
8963,I agree with your opinion. He can take another way to punish them.
8964,I agree with you. He think that the solution to control drugs is killing people. I think his solution is excessive. I don't agree with death penalty. Another solution should be imprisonment. And we should solve this problem little by little.
8965,"I think so. By reading this comment, I can consider this difficult problem seriously. It is true that multinational companies should pay more taxes,but the degree should not be excessive."
8966,"I agree with you. this problem is very complex. It is true that doping is bad thing, but privacy should be respected."
8967,"I think so. This problem is very difficult. Race and culture problem should be cared consciously. Recently, Muslim are be discriminated. We should not relate Muslim to terrorism."
8968,I think so too. This result of election is not only problem in the U.S. We should focus on Trump's action.
8969,"I think so too. The problem of the Amazon Go is decrease of employment. Big companies need to employ many people. If this system don't need man power, some people will lose their jobs."
8970,I agree with your opinion. I think the athlete should play on the fair occasion.And policing it is very important for them.
8971,"Even if the numbers the Guardian claims were true, it was still very small compared the people killed in Syria, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Not that I agree with Mr. Duterte, just that it is apparent the Guardian hold a grudge against him and has been vilifying him obsessively for a while. Now, it is that seems to be a better thing is the typical hypocrisy from some wired people. If they don't like the Philippines and want to leave, they will just push the Filipino people farther, and the Chinese will be glad to come and fill in the vacancy of business."
8972,Your idea is maybe a little silly. because the 6 months will be a crackdown on any dissenters. This guy is many times worse than Marcos. If you want to know what it feels like to live in a dictatorship visit his city. The man is a dangerous dangerous man and this blood shed will be only the beginning. Dark times for the Philippines ahead.
8973,"I think similarly idea to yours. Even if it's judged from the view of the international law, avoidance of the corporation profit tax is the fact plan conspicuous in particular. And when it'll be a problem between the state, exposure becomes difficult extremely for extraterritoriality to tangle."
8974,"I'm not sure many people have to give up a career because they have to take medicine. But generally those who become ill and have to give up a career do so because there is no available means to let them carry on example. if I lose a leg I'll still be able to do my job while, obviously, athletes won't and others as well who have physically active jobs."
8975,"Just, I think so! I wanna be a true fair player. It's not only in each game or match but also in moral for Olympic. Such a problem should be taken a measure by Tokyo Olympic."
8976,"When I read this news, it's not convincing and made me thinking deeply. I strongly believe that there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and the burkini and there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether. Maybe when a woman decides to choose to wear burkini, she should take into some consideration the customs and values of the country she is in as the one making this decision. And I wanna disappear such a religion's or culture's discrimination."

We are not only a part of customers but also one of social unit. Needless to say, we should think much better balance about time and costs."

9032,"I think religious problem is delicate and complex. I do not believe in any religion and can not understand the feeling of some people who blame other religion believer. However, I can understand religion is very important for followers. Therefore, I think that when we go to foreign country we should understand the country's back ground and view on religions."
9033,"I'm afraid that I will break a taboo in the country which I will visit, so I want to know much about world's taboos."
9034,"I was supervised at this news.I have never been to a foreign country, so I didn't know that there were foreign taboos before this class. I'd like to try so as not to break local taboo when I go to a foreign country."
9035,"I think there are a lot of rules and customs which travelers have to be careful and obey if people hope to travel smoothly. Therefore, before traveling, people should search its affairs and rules by using the Internet or talking with friends of the countries."

9037,1.Because I want to be taught English by native speaker to learn practical English. 2.I expect to be able to talk with foreign people in English fluently.
9038,I think the matters over religious differences are more delicate than we think. What we can do is to consider cultural backgrounds and develop flexible attitudes when we keep in contact with foreigners.
9039,"I didn't know that the religious concept makes such matters over the world. To resolve these problems, first what we should is to study, understand and have sympathy with other religious ideas."
9040,"For me it was not that surprising because of the fact that I used to lived in a Buddhism country. Thailand had the similar law as Sri Lanka which is to ban anything that is considered insulting the Buddha. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' This quote tells us best about the problem."
9041,"I was very surprised at the religious culture in Sri Lanka.In Japan, there are no strict rules, but the Olympic is going to be held in 2020. Given this fact , I think we have to consider religious culture more seriously. At that time,we also need to treat all cultures equally."
9042,"Even the woman practices Buddhism, she cannot be accepted by Sri Lankan culture. I think it is not her fault, she just believes her religion in her way. But may be she should research about Sri Lankan culture before her travel because it is so sad to have a problem between the people who believe same religion."
9043,"Most of the conflict that is happening in the world is caused by religion.Religion is an important and precious thing,but I don't think it is good to impose it on others.It is because a ruin is born.I hope that religion should be a tool for people to connect,to help each other."
9044,Many Japanese people believe no religion. So it is difficult for Japanese people to understand religious taboo. But we must make efforts to understand other cultures when we are abroad.
9045,"when I read this story, I wasn't surprise. I used to lived in Indonesia and Qatar, and both countries were strict Muslims, so it is not hard to imagine those situation even it is different religion. I also think these British tourists should have known those religious rules before they go, especially if that country has strict belief."
9046,I thought this issue was controversial. My opinion is that she should have learned other cultures beforehand in order not to cause any problems like this. All we need to have is 'respect' towards other cultures...
9047,"I think that Naomi Coleman should have check about Sri Lanka because a little misunderstanding can result in a big conflict. However,it is hard for me to understand that people are judged by religion.Japanese culture includes various religions such as Christmas and Oshogatsu and they're very fun,so l want to suggest to Sri Lanka that they tolerant the religion of others."
9048,"I was surprised at this news because I know little about foreign countries. So I was afraid that I will break taboos without being aware of it when going abroad. In order not to be the case, I try to study other country's taboos."
9049,This is the way Europeans think.
9050,"1.I chose this class because I would like to know current affairs in this world and also I want to be taught by a native English teacher. 2. I expect to achieve some abilities ,such as communicating in English well ,reading English newspapers ,discussing recent problem in this world."
9051,"I was very surprised at this story when I read for the first time,because this kind of treatment cannot be in Japan.But in this world,there are many religious rules and manners,so I think even we Japanese should consider these things seriously."
9052,"I was surprised to know this news. it's impossible in Japan because Japan has a variety of believers. But I think travelers should flow the custom and religion of the country. Like this saying, 'When in Rome, do as a Romans do.'"
9053,"I was surprised at this story because l didn't know about Sri Lanka at all.ln Japan,there are rules that a person who has a tattoo must not take a public bath but it doesn't mean he is breaking the law.l have little knowledge about religious rules.So l think that it is very important to learn about culture and rules of other countries."
9054,"I was surprised at this news. Freedom of religion is permitted in Japan, therefore religious problems are not familiar to me. I thought I need to learn about religious problems to understand the other country's culture."
9055,"We don't know the rules of foreign countries.I think that when we go to the foreign country,we should check the rules of country.In addition,all countries have to make the rules public not to repeat such a story."
9056,"It is very important to respect the cultures of their countries when we travel the world, I think. However this case of the article might be too strict. Sri Lanka is the Buddhism and also she is a Buddhist. Both believe the Buddha. I believe Sri Lanka Government should open the door for tourists wider about religion."
9057,"I was surprised at this news. Many Japanese people do not know religious rule and customs. So if we go to those country, we should pay attention than other country people."
9058,"After reading this article, I was very surprised at the religious rules. In Japan, there is no state region, and I don't believe in any region. Therefore, I think that we, particular Japanese, cannot easily understand why this problem occurred. I believe each country has their own culture formed from a long history so that foreigners shouldn't say 'it is better' and ' it should be abolished' and so on. I think what we should do is to follow our own culture when we go abroad."
9059,"I think , due to the development of science and technology ,the connection between countries is becoming closer and closer .To another word , the globalization grows faster than before. And then comes the problem that cultural differences between cultures sometimes may result in some dissension. Like the women's experience , mentioned in the news . I think the intercultural understanding or respecting each country's culture should be emphasized as a premise when we travel or visit other countries. If we do so, the less dissensions happen , the more peaceful our world will be."
9060,"I think , due to the development of science and technology ,the connection between countries is becoming closer and closer .To another word , the globalization grows faster than before.

I think the intercultural understanding or respecting each country's culture should be emphasized as a premise when we travel or visit other countries. If we do so, the less dissensions happen , the more peaceful our world will be."
9061,"From this article, I learned how important it is to obey local rules. According to the article, Naomi's tattoo was viewed as disrespectful even she didn't mean to insult Buddhism. Behaviors can mean differently in different situations. The news reminds me of the importance to understand cultures in other countries."
9062,"In Japan, many people don't believe any religions. So we have grown up without rules about religion. But in other countries, religion is very important thing for them. So I thought we must research the rules about religions when we go abroad."
9063,"From this article, I thought religion is such a important thing in other countries. I felt this is kind of religion discrimination. Japanese should know more about religion and how people in other countries think about religion. I know some of taboos in other countries but not a lot, so I would like to know more about it."
9064,"The article reminded me how sensitive the religious problem is. Most of Japanese people including me are unconcerned with religious issues, so I think we have to understand various cultures when we are abroad."
9065,"This story wasn't surprising for me because I used to live in Indonesia and there were religious rules that were different from Japan's. The differences of religion make a lot of problems, especially Asian countries and European countries. It is important to search the country's own rules before visiting foreign countries and respect them. I think the most important thing is to respect the country's own rules."
9066,"For the beginning, I think it's severe punishment to be arrested for the tattoo. It's individual freedom. But I could see the faith of people to Buddha in Sri Lanka to go on reading this story. And I recognized the importance to understand other difference culture and background again. Today, many problems are happened by a misunderstanding about each culture. I hope that we notice that by this article."
9067,"I was very surprised when I read this story. In Japan, there are not many people believe in religions so we have to pay attention when we go abroad. I am very interested in taboos so I want to study it."
9068,I was surprised at this news. This news is that a woman was arrested because of her tattoo on her arm. I didn't know the violation of religious rule leads to a large incident. So i think that i should keep this incident in my mind when i go abroad.
9069,"After reading this article, I fully realized the difficulty of understanding each religious practice. I also noticed there is a danger that a person takes the behavior unconsciously which sometimes offends other people's religious feelings, as described in this material. So I should pay enough attention to my behavior even if it is trifling when I go on a trip abroad."
9070,"Most Japanese are not familiar with religion,so this story is so interesting for me. Through this story,I think this phrase is important for us 'When in Rome ,do as the Romans do.' Probably,we should learn religious view at school."
9071,I couldn't be aware of religious problems around the world like these because I have lived in japan which is a very peaceful country since I was born. So I want to study hard about a lot of religions and countries in the world and find out solutions to many religious problems.
9072,"After reading this article, I felt a little surprised. I knew religion is a serious problem, but I did not know that religious taboos are treated as laws. In my country, we are allowed to have freedom of religion and I think every one should have the right of having freedom of religion. However, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.', we should remember that we are vulnerable groups as tourists."
9073,"We see news about religious issues almost everyday. In order to resolve those conflicts, what we can do is to try to lean about different religions and respect our diversity. Besides, we should never insult other religions."
9074,"I was very surprised when I read this news, because I don't believe any specific gods and I usually don't think about religious taboos. I think it isn't easy for many people who have different religions to live without any collisions."
9075,"I was surprised with this news. Most Japanese people isn't much religious, so this kind of problem rarely happens in Japan. Since many people in the world are religious, it is important for us to understand the problem related to religion."
9076,I'm sorry to be late commenting on the blog. 1. Because my acquaintance recommended this course. 2. I want to improve my English to read English books and newspapers without any difficulty.
9077,I'm sorry to be late commenting on the blog. 1. Because my acquaintance recommended this course. 2. I want to improve my English skill to read English books and newspapers without any difficulty.
9078,"First of all, most of Japanese don't believe in particular religion.Thus I can't imagine that deporting who has a Buddha tattoo and arrested in the act of kissing a Buddha statue. And also I had been going to Christian school for 15 years. However my friends didn't believe in god. In another words,for ordinary Japanese, there is nothing so sacred as Buddha. So most people can't understand the feeling of having their god insulted.For this reason,it is important to understand each other and to respect other culture."
9079,Similar matter exists in Japan. People who have tattoo can't plunge in pool and hot spring for tattoo is the symbol of anti social forces. So there are many argument whether we should allow tourists who have tattoo to access pool and hot spring. we should take seriously this matter as one fact to decide our stance to foreign people who visit Japan.
9080,"I read this article and feel that Sri Lanka is such a exclusive country. This is because there are many things in Sri Lanka that we cannot understand. However ,in my opinion,we should not condemn the customs from such a distance but should try to understand 'Sri Lanka '. I don't think that is easy but think the very efforts are most important for international community."
9081,I was very surprised at this article about taboos. I think I should research and check taboos before I visit foreign countries so as not to break religious manners and taboos.
9082,"I think Sri Lanka should be more tolerant and accept other culture and way of thinking. In Japan, most people do not believe in religion or god and so do I, so I cannot understand the feelings of people in Sri Lanka. Recently, there are many types of people in the world. Also, people can visit foreign county very easily. If many countries start deporting people who unacceptable to the country, it would become a big problem. At the same time, I thought Japan should be more open to the foreign culture, because many 'onsen' in Japan do not accept people who has tattoo in his body. Many people would come and visit Japan in 2020, so I think Japan should prepare for it."
9083,"I think this is a delicate problem,because each country has a religion and each religion has a difference.So if we have a difference ,we are going to cause friction.But we live in the global society,so we have to solve this problem.I think in this case we have to have a thoughtful consideration to others which called Omoiyari in Japanese.If you have it we can understand each other,and then we can solve these problems."
9084,"I understood that each country has its own taboo and I didn't know many of such taboos. If I had seen someone who had posed for photos in front of statues of Buddha in Sri Lanka before I read this article, I wouldn't have focused on him. And I learned that even if people believe the same religion, there are some ways to express their belief. However I think that when we go to foreign countries, we should check their rules and manners before."
9085,"I was surprised at this news because l didn't know about rule of Sri Lanka at all.In Japan, almost people don't believe religion and we have no idea rules of it. So when we go abroad we should study culture,Time background and religion."
9086,"We can say this story is an example of cross-cultured collision. And I think it isn't unrelated to us because many foreign people recently have come to Japan partly owing to Olympic in 2020. About all, we must gain knowledge about different cultures, religions and thoughts. We can't avoid intersecting people from different region according to globalization. We must keep thinking ways to realize the coexistence with all nations in mutual prosperity."
9087,"I was surprised at this news. In this article, a British woman don't know taboo in Sri Lanka but she was arrested. So it is dangerous to go abroad not to know country we go. I think it is important to know other country's culture when we go abroad"
9088,"I think that a religion exists to satisfy a mental relief primarily.Such as 'spiritual home'. But now,conflict often break out by antagonism of religion.I think of this fact very sadly.To solve this problem,we have to deepen more mutual understanding. I'd like to go abroad without worrying about a taboo."
9089,"I was surprised at this news. Any Japanese don't believe the religion, I don't believe too. So, I can't understand their feelings. But, it is important that people with different ideals understand each other. I try to this problem in my life."
9090,"I think that Naomi had some faults in this incident. Of course the the deportment may be said to be too much, but she should have looked up more before she visited the country and cared more about the local people I felt. Because even if she had not deported from the country, it doesn't change the fact that there are some who are hunted by her."
9091,"I didn't know these religious manners. To communicate world people, I should study each custom and understand the religious."
9092,"I view Vienna's installment of these pedestrian crossing lights in a positive way. Gender equality will be more emphasized and there will be less biased opinions regarding the topics of gay lesbians, since pedestrians world look up at the lights every time they walk down the streets. Moreover, I believe that it may be worthwhile to install them in Japan, because our country dose not have open-hearted attitudes and welcoming approaches toward transgender couples, compared to other countries worldwide such as the United States and European nations."
9093,"I was surprised at this news, and understood that religious problems are very delicate. It is important that everyone respect each belief, especially when you go abroad you should follow local people's behavior."
9094,I decide that I will never get the tattoo.
9095,"I think these traffic lights are very unique, and this idea is interesting. However, it is too unique to introduce it in Japan. I think such signal should increase not losing the original purpose."
9096,The number '40%' is very shocking date for me. An aging society is one of the most serious problems in Japan. I think we must pursue profit of the whole nation including elderly people in the future.
9097,"I don't have friends who are 'gays',so I can't only discriminate but also treat equally.In other words,I can't completely understand this problem. I think there are many people like me in Japan. However,in my opinion,this problem is what we solve.There are many gays in Japan who can't confess they are ,so we Japanese aren't familiar with them. If we create the society where gays can confess their secrets easily to other people,we can start understanding them and solve this complicated problem."
9098,"It's very complicated and delicate problem not only for those who are the actual homosexual but also for the people that are not, and that is why I think this Vienna's traffic light is such a unique and interesting way. It's neither harming anyone nor being pushy, but effective. Traffic lights are something we see everyday without thinking anything and we maybe feel close to the LGBT problem just by looking at the traffic lights. The more people understanding this problem, the more LGBT people being accepted to the society."
9099,"Actually I think there should be a death penalty simply because we need it. There is things we must not do as a person, and death penalty necessary for the ones who can't follow the rules. In this case it's worse that the suspect killed others for probably the most selfish reason, and as Ichiro Matsui said I think he should have killed himself."
9100,"The man who was arrested by killing two people may be fearful of committing suicide on his own. A time you are about to reap your life must be so frightening as to make your hair stand on end. So he must have wanted to make situation someone kill him in place of him. Then, I was surprised at a phase ---'this case particularly unusual.' Frankly, when I saw this news, I thought that this isn't usual much. For I remember several incidents like this. Such trend have to be stopped."
9101,"I was very surprised that there are such traffic lights in Austria.In Japan, I feel there are not enough consideration to LGBT, but our society is diversifying today.In addition to this, I heard that they feel they are excluded before and then I thought that we should consider everything from the point of other 's view. By doing so ,we can accept LGBT more easily. Like Austria, changing the situation which is familiar with us helps us to change the posture to LGBT."
9102,"This plan is so good idea. Marriage between the same sex should also be admitted by law in Japan, so our prejudice must be removed by such plan."
9103,I think that this is a good idea to promote tolerance and the idea that same-sex couples are a normal everyday reality.Becouse the traffic lights are looked at almost all people even who are not interested in same-sex couples .Maybe they don't join a event about it so traffic lights is a good way to promote it.
9104,"I didn't know about this story , and I think it is really interesting. However If they did this in Japan, most people would probably not accept this, because I think Japan has much less understanding for LGBT than other countries. I hope world would be better for those LGBT people."
9105,This new type of traffic light is good idea to promote understanding for gay couple. But Japan is not open minded country toward same-sex couples or marriage. So I think it is difficult to install the new traffic light in our country. I hope we will make a more comfortable environment for same-sex couples and see this unique light in Japan near future.
9106,"I thought a Viennese traffic light with the new design was a model of the world. I thought maybe Japan might also correspond to tolerance to a homosexual like these policies. There are various people in the world, so I'd like to accept the respective individuality and live."
9107,"I agree with this idea because this idea is equal to all people. So I think Japan should follow this unique system. But now, many people don't accept same-sex couples in Japan. We should learn some good ideas from other countries and change our wrong views."
9108,"I will be 62 years old in 2060, but I should earn money for older people than me. It's a bad future, so I think people aged 65 or over should work."
9109,"I think that this attempt 'gay and strait' is very interesting and good for everyone. While everyone -a man and woman couples, gay couples and lesbian couples- can be able to walk the pedestrian crossing with a happy feeling. By having awareness equal treatment with a happy feeling, many people will be able to accept various types of love."
9110,"This is a sensitive problem and requires careful handling.l don't have acquaintances who are gays.So,l can't feel familiarly with this problem but l think that this way is very good. We Japanese should have much interest in this topic than before."
9111,"I would like to suggest that Japanese government set up this traffic lights because the idea that same sex couples are normal is not popular in Japan. Marriage between two people of the same sex legally has not been recognized in japan,so it is hard for them to live along with. Some of my friends are bisexual and there may be more people who keep it a secret. I hope this situation is improved."
9112,"I was quite amazed by this unique idea. Although it is a sensitive problem, I thought using a traffic lights is one effective way to let people know about same sex marriage. Marriage between the same gender is generally not acceptable in Japan today. However, by setting up these lights in the big city where many people gather, Shibuya for example, would be helpful for people to get more understanding towards this complicated and delicate issue. We definitely need to understand there are various types of love exist in this world. Also, we must have respect to LGBT people, too."
9113,"I was surprised to read this article because I had not thought about gay. Thinking about it, I think we are not interested in gay and there is gender discrimination in Japan. So it is important to adopt gay and straight traffic light or thing like this and attract more attention."
9114,"I was startled to read this article. I often use computer and email so less and less I write kanji. As Japanese, it is important to acquire the skill of writing kanji. In order to achieve this, we should use letters instead of email."
9115,"I was so amazed by this article! If it had been in Japan, maybe there would had been both arguments for and against. I believe every people have rights to love others regardless of their sexes and genders. Though I am not a lesbian, I don't want LGBT people to be defeated from the streo type thinking. For the comfortable society for every people, Japanese should think more freely!"
9116,"I know this law was enacted and also I know it doesn't work well. Though I often see the commercials of this law before the movies in cinemas, I learned in Information literacy classes that it doesn't mean because the cases that people who break the law consciously or unconsciously are almost uncountable. It's very important to protect the copy rights, but Japanese Government should think more efficient law!"
9117,"I think Japan should have more positive policy to make people understand for LGBT people through this kind of action, because there are terrorism caused by people who don't understand about them. To avoid terrorism, we should be more interested in and know about the problem, and LGBT people's feeling. They have same right for liberty like us, so we should treat them as same way as other our friends."
9118,"By unthinking hoax, one innocent people died. I have never heard such a terrible incident caused by hoax. Jacintha Saldanha's life should have continued and must have had something fun and happy after this. I think it is very sorrowful that her life came to the end by unthinking people, and people around her -her friends, family and colleagues and so on- get really sad."
9119,"I agree to the idea that encourages to hire the elderly as labor force. There are two reasons. First this attempt will help their lives in this age of financial difficulties which include a lack of pension. Moreover, it' ll lead economic stimulation compensating for a shortage of labor which results from a declining birthrate. This problem is likely to be more critical, so I think the government has to take any actions immediately."
9120,"I think setting up 'gay and straight' traffic lights is a good idea. Because it is necessary to work on and accept such minority problems diligently in this age. Especially in Japan, LGBT issues seem to be apprehended negatively compared with any other countries. I think it is sometimes important to consider the problems and their personal rights from a minority's point of view ."
9121,"I think installing gay and straight traffic lights is innovative. Recently,people all over the world have accepted transgenders.However, in Japan,we still have less understanding of homosexual people. They have equal rights for free love like us. We should have more attention and interest for this delicate problem."
9122,"I'm surprised that many people are trying to take cosmetic surgery. I think our body and face is the only one inherited from own parents. Everyone may have a complex about their features, but it's a part of good character. We shouldn't think it as serious matter."
9123,"I think pedestrian traffic lights in Vienna are good ideas, for these lights play the role of symbol of acceptance to minorities. Recently,the existence of LGBT has been recognized more. What a party takes such action as a policy is one of the great ways to protect LGBT people's rights."
9124,"I think that the death penalty is valid punishment.What is reason there,l can't forgive murders.However,as the criminal murdered because of the presence of the death penalty , we must think the system over to prevent such cases."
9125,"Everyone ,living in the world, is born equally, even , you are gay or straight. Setting those traffic light ,mentioned in the news , symbolizes that gay should be treated equally. I think Vienna has taken the most important step to protect the gay's right of equality . Still , there are many countries do not admit the legitimacy of gay , and to some extent , gay is a vulnerable group in those countries, but they also have the right to live in the world without unfair treatment or discrimination. To my opinion, Vienna also has started a good trend , and the trend will blow through the world."
9126,"I thought a new type of Viennese traffic light is good idea to accept LGBT person. All people understand, we should treat LGBT person as another person. However in reality, we perceive homosexual person as special. We should treat all person equally in the true sense."
9127,"Recently, diplomatic relations between North Korea and many nations are strained in a high state of tension. Today there are various information exchanging on the Internet, we should see the world calmly."
9128,"Though some TV programs and other media are now paying attention to the issue of same-sex marriage in Japan, the awareness of the issue among people is still low. On the contrary, the issue has been discussed many times in the US, probably because of peoples' tenacious appeal. I believe that we should have that in mind as an important issue."
9129,"The movement of appealing gay couples by using traffic lights seems like an effective attempt to me. Its was proved to be a success by the number of likes on Facebook. Though it might not be easy to do the same act in Japan, I guess it would create a sensation among people."
9130,"I agree that Japanese are loosing ability to write kanji due to emails. I think that automation makes our life convenient but at the same time it takes our ability to do something by ourselves.For example,we have portable cooking stoves or gas burners so many people cannot and need not ignite with stones or woods."
9131,"These days, the situations between North Korea and other nations, especially South Korea, Japan, U.S are getting worse. North Korea is continuously testing missiles and nuclear weapons. We have to solve this problem, and I think what president Trump has done are better than what president Obama did. President Trump said, if he had a chance to talk with Kim Jong-un, it will be his honor. It will be much better, if we could solve this without any violence. I hope everything will be fine and peace."
9132,"I was moved to read this article which high technology made it possible for paralyzed person to walk for 42.2-kilometer. I think if researchers improve this suit and make more compact one, such disabled people will be able to use ones in daily lives. Then, they live more happily because they can do more things by themselves freely. So, I hope high technology evolves more and more to help a lot of people."
9133,I can't image the society that there are lot of gays. Because I don't know who gay is around me and other people in Japan are in same situation. But many problems are being happened around the world in fact and we need to recognize its the actual situation. So I was given the chance thinking about that from this article. Equal is important theme as a whole humanity. That's why this project is great and should be continued.
9134,I have friends who are gay so I can understand this kind of idea. I think it is good to understand gay people in japan like Europe.
9135,"A traffic light is a symbol of traffic. I think it's a fascinating idea to use the symbol for attract interest in the complicated sexual problem. But,the traffic light is the symbol which protects the life of all races of the whole world.And the sexual problem which explained by these sentences is very delicate. So we have to judge present European trend carefully."
9136,I think this is serious problem.But we cannot avoid this problem so we must try to find a solution.
9137,"I think it is great to take an action to solve social issues such as sexual problem, but traffic light is the thing that keeps safety of traffic, not the symbol of sexual problem so I think there is other ways to attract interest in the problem. For example, make a move about gay or straight. That way, people can be more familiar with gay and straight. Also now day, SNS is the great tool to get together with people from all over the world so gay and straight people and the people who want to support them can get together using SNS and make website or generate their opinion to the world. Especially in Japan, people think gay and straight are unusual. However, if people continue taking actions to solve the problem, someday, even Japanese people will be familiar with gay and straight."
9138,"I think the concept of this campaign is good to increase the number of people who are familiar with sexual problems. This is because it's fun to find new designs of traffic lights. If there are such lights in Japan, everyday walk to school will be more exciting."
9139,"We can't definitely conclude that it's the best way to spread the idea of same-sex couples. Certainly, this is a unique way to promote the idea that same-sex couples are normal, and it is obvious that people in Vienna are positive of the new traffic lights. However, we must not agree to this policy easily. We don't know how people who want to do same-sex marriage feel about these new traffic lights, because this article doesn't show us their reaction. We have to discuss it deeply when they are introduced to Japan."
9141,"I didn't know this story.Same-sex marriage began to be accepted in Japan.So it is important to take same-sex couples into consideration. But I think installing many traffic lights is waste of money,resources and time.If I were a taxpayer,I would be angry. How many traffic lights are there in Japan? It is impossible to exchange all the traffic lights in Japan.For pedestrians,what is important is not gay or straight but red or green."
9142,"I agree to Abe because he try to make Japan a really independent nation.Now Japan relies on USA too much.If some country attack Japan,Japan can do nothing because of the Constitution,which was made in the remote past,1946,by GHQ.So we have no choice but to wait for the USA forces to help us.If Japan-USA security treaty breaks,Japan will be in danger.As time passes,international affairs change,especially nowadays,they change rapidly.So we must revise the constitution.USA is not by far the biggest country in the world as it used to be.If Abe succeed in changing Self-Defense Forces into the Japanese forces,pressure from China,South Korea,North Korea and Russia will be weakened."
9143,"I think this project is a good thing in order to eliminate discrimination towards the same-sex couples. I also think we should do the same project in Japan because there are still some bias or cremations for 'LGBT' compared to other advanced nations.There is also another problem about money,but I think some money is necessarily needed against certain discrimination."
9144,"I think using the death penalty for suicide is idiot.But this my opinion doesn't mean I support doing away with the death penalty. In some country,the death penalty is already abolished,but I think it is needed.There are two reasons. First,for victims,murderers already killed some people.so,why they are allowed to take other person's lives without their lives. Second ,for other innocent citizens,if murderer can live as ordinary,we are threaten by the risk of being killed."
9146,"I have seen a lot of comments with political correctness. However, I think it is still a problem difficult to resolve. In my opinion, we should not treat the traffic lights, which is the things in the public like this. Because some people still can not accept gays and I will never ask them chance their mind just because that is their freedom. We cannot force people accept gays only because gays are vulnerable groups."
9147,"I have seen a lot of comments with political correctness. However, I think it is still a problem difficult to resolve. In my opinion, we should not treat the traffic lights, which are the things in the public like this. Because some people still cannot accept gays and I will never ask them chance their mind, just because that is their freedom. We cannot force people to accept gays only because gays are vulnerable groups."
9148,"This is 2017. Now I think the EU did not deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. Britain has decided to withdraw from the EU. There are also some sounds that opposite the EU in other country like France. What is more, a lot of terrorist events are caused in the EU. There are both developed countries and developing countries in the EU. Thus, it is hard to avoid the contradiction between different countries. Finally, the most serious problem is if the EU should receive the refugee. Almost all countries disagree to receive the refugee, but Germany agree to receive the refugee. As we all know, Germany is the most powerful country in the EU. Thus it is really difficult to decide if the EU should receive the refugee. As the EU, which is a unit with so much contradiction did not reserve the Nobel Peace Prize."
9150,"I think the concept of the Vienna's project is very unique and has been successful for attracting the attention of all road users.However, the problems of same sex marriage are not simple. Some gay people or some people may feel the idea of Vienna is not good. Therefore. We should continue to looking for better ideas."
9152,"I' m interested in the war or the disputes. So I chose the Second World War for my graduation thesis's theme. And I think this problem is affected by these past international situation. Today, we are often threatened by North Korea's military power. To study more is necessary for us to solve this problems and we must talk to them until we understand each other. So I intend to study about North Korea."
9153,I think this topic should be discussed all over the world.Some people have an aversion to social minorities such as gay and HIV.The reason is that they don't have the correct knowledge for them.Japan is still prejudiced.I think it is important to recognize diversity through such events.
9155,"Now a days, the relationships between North Korea, South Korea, Japan, and US is getting worse. North Korea is planning to yeast their rocket launch and Japan is in a danger. North Korea's military power is getting stronger. We must continuously talk to them to solve this problem. I hope this problem will be solved without any violence."
9156,"This is a very delicate problem not only for LGBT people but also for the people who are not LGBT. I think Vienna's traffic light is very unique idea to make people think this LGBT problem. Also, this would not harm any people. I think these traffic lights would make many people understand this problem."
9158,"I am surprised that people do not deepen their understanding of sex unless they do such a campaign. Problem is that people think they must belong to either a man or a woman.I think that those overflowing from a man or a woman will be discriminated. If people fundamentally change this idea( people must belong to either a man or a woman), I think that it becomes unnecessary to make a special campaign with high money and everyone will be able to recognize each one naturally."
9159,"Accusing seismologist of miss judgment about the earthquake is not proper treatment for this accident. Blaming the accident on someone is the easiest way to clam people's anger or sadness, but earthquake is natural disaster. I think the death of more than 300people is not the seismologist's failure. People who experienced this disaster should face the prevention of this kind of natural disaster and try never to repeat same tragedy in the future."
9160,"It is simple idea to change the traffic light's design. But I never though up this simple idea. Considering the traffic light's design, it is not equal to design only a man. So I think this idea is very important to make a world equal."
9161,I am surprised that the advanced action have done and I think it should be welcomed.I think that the rights of the LGBT people are extremely oppressed compared to normal people in all over the world .I think all people should be tolerance for them. further more i hope government led the movement like the city of Berlin.
9162,"This article made me notice the problem of the mass media.Even if Mel Greig and Michael Christian wanted to know about the Duchess of Cambridge's health,they should not have deceived her.I take it for granted that people took to Twitter in furious outbursts.I hope that such a problem will never happen."
9163,I was very surprised when I first read this topic. In Japan LGBT people have many trouble. I know that many other countries have good law for them. I hope Japan will be more kind for LGBT people.
9165,"I think these ideas are very good. In Japan, LGBT people are not admitted so much. So I think we should take in these ideas and admit them."
9166,I went to Shibuya to watch LGBT's marriage parade after reading this article. There are two LGBT couples and they were blessed. I got an impression they was accepted in Japan from several years before. but we have few idea that LGBT is admitted in the daily life as traffic picture so we should consider it.
9167,"Apparently,a beautiful face is desirable to everyone.Some people choose to do cosmetic procedures to become beautiful.But,we should not forget that the beauty,attained from cosmetic procedure,is at the price of our health .I am not oppose taking cosmetic surgery ,because , everyone has his or her right to make decisions.But , I want to remind those peoples who have decided to take cosmetic surgery,that the real beauty is inside and they should pay more attention to their health."
9168,"It is a very innovative idea to install unique traffic lights to promote enlightenment activities of homosexual couples.Becauce traffic lights are something that every person will see without fail.More than anything else, the good point is you can tell sexual issues,which are sensitive issues,without becoming too serious.The Japanese government is very passive to deal with homosexual couples' problems. Also there are problems of lack of understandings or awareness on the side of the Japanese people.However no matter what sense of values people may have, the most important thing is to have the attitude to understand and respect one another."
9169,The threat of America and North Korea is becoming increasingly intense.China is about to arbitrate but at the moment North Korea shoot two missiles to japan. Horrible situation that could not be thought out in 2012 is occurring so we have to discuss this problem seriously.
9170,"I thought it is a good idea to set up the unique traffic lights. It makes our lives more enjoyable, and also it can get some attention and promote about LGBT. People became to accept LGBT people more easily, because we see traffic lights in everyday life. I want Japan to adopt this idea someday, because some people in Japan are not tolerance for LGBT."
9171,"I think same sex marriage should be legal in the all countries. It is legal in some states in America now, but not all. Also, it is not legal in Japan. I have heard that it is difficult to accept same sex marriage in the U.S. because of the religion, Christianity. I think it is really difficult problem, but there are many people who want to marry with same sex person, so I hope it would be accepted and be legal in some day."
9172,"These days, we rely on smartphones so that we are losing the chance to actually write kanji. This lose of writing skill is a serious problem than people might think. If we could not write kanji properly, it is a shame to say we are Japanese in internationalize world. We really need to focus on this issue and try to gain ability to make our life more convenient."
9173,"I was surprised that there are such traffic lights in Austria. I think these lights are very unique and this concept that homosexual should be allowed is terrific. I hope these lights should be introduced in Japan, but I think it is difficult considering the Japanese national character. In Japan, freedom is not be respected and efficiency is the most important thing. We have to consider this problem in a long span."
9174,I think that introducing Austrian traffic lights can change how Japanese think about LGBT. I think that Japanese not being open to LGBT is due to the lack of knowledge about them. So I think it is important to set Austrian traffic lights at place everyone can see and make people aware of LGBT. We should not discriminate any kinds of love and there are countless ways to love others.
9175,"These days, this problem is excited much controversy. Not only North Korea but also Japan is in danger so that we have to discuss this problem and Japanese government should cope with this problem carefully and seriously."
9176,I agree this Austrian measure to spread the way of thinking about gay. I think it good that gay is recognized all of the world.
9177,I was so surprised that idea was already implemented. There are some people who are gay in Japan so I think we should be good to them with open minds. Changing the law of Japan about the same sexual marriage might be difficult but changing our thought is the first step of changing Japan.
9179,"I think this is a good idea to get a right for LGBT people.But this is not for Japan,because LGBT problems is difficult to figure them out in Japan.So anyway we have to discuss about it,and bide our time.And then we are going to be able to install this idea in Japan."
9180,"Traffic lights are essential for our lives and we see almost everyday. I thought this idea is very unique and this action will make people's attention about LGBT problem. It is difficult to success this action in Japan, but I hope people in Japan show a little understanding about this issue."
9181,"I think this idea is interesting and it should be introduced in other places such as America. However I think it is hard to introduce such signals in Japan , because it's still not a popular idea that encourages treating gay people equally. There is still hard bias against gay people that they are something creepy or strange. We need to remove such bias first to encourage the world where people can live happy regardless of their skin colors or sex preferences."
9182,"This is a serious problem for us,because when we retire our work no one can support us.So we are going to be in a severe situation.But in Japan we have a great technicians to make robbots.So from now on we have to develop them and let them be able to help us."
9183,"I agree with this President Barack Obama's opinion and I think same sex marriage should be allowed in the all countries. There are various and different people in the world, but this almost all society's rule are made by majorities. This is very unfair matter and it is important to make a comfortable society for the minorities."
9184,Japanese people have used Kanji since too many years ago so I think we should learn not only how to use computers but also a lot of Kanji and we should save our traditional cultures. I think relying on computers is not bad but we need to respect Japanese cultures such as calligraphy and to tell people all over the world about those interest.
9185,"I am not particularly surprised at Amazon's the new efforts. Because it has been positively discussed in recent years to make the work efficiently by using artificial intelligence and robots. From now on, I think that humans should think about how to escape from simple labor and find new jobs."
9186,"I think this traffic lights are very unique,and this idea is interesting.Marriage between same sex should be permitted,and the more people should understand this problem."
9187,"I think this traffic lights' idea is very interesting . Diversity is very important , but it is also important to keep original purpose . This idea should be adopted by a lot of country."
9189,"Due to flow of diversity, this trend may be spreading over the world. But I think we shouldn't forget there are people who is difficult to accept homosexual because of religious matter. It is ideal but Unrealistic for everyone in the world to accept for a while. we may have chance we talk to such people. Religious is very delicate. For it define people style. Then, It may be important to accept such people in order to avoid useless argument."
9190,"The obsession that one person has to love another one whose sex is different from that of one's is widespread all over the world.And people who love sane sex person is discriminated and seen as sickness and abnormal when these are far from the truth and they were not in the old day. We should realize that there is the right that guarantees the freedom of choice and understand that the person who loves same sex one is anything but sickness and abnormal and make the tendency in which everyone can love someone,marry,play sex free from discrimination and condemn .To make such a tendency,introducing this traffic light is very effective because of it's fame"
9191,"I think the law is important. Recently, we can get any information by the Internet. And we can get any movies and comics easily. But almost it can be illegal. If we get movies and comics illegally, the movie and comics market will decrease. It is not good for the economic. So the law is very important. Illegally downloading should be prohibited by the law."
9192,"Of course it is one of a serious problem which is caused by modern technology , but it also means we have much progress in technology . Today, less and less people write letters and more and more people use smartphones. So I think it is not as much serious as reporters point out ."
9193,It is impossible to prevent Japan from aging population.So what is needed is not to effort of increasing the number of children rapidly but to think how create a society which is kind to not only the senior but also all people.
9194,"These days the technological advance is amazing. However the advance is not only have good influences for children, but also have bad effects for them. For instance the smart phone, the electronic dictionary. These items are so useful that children rely on these devices. It is serious problem, so all schools and teachers have to change this situation."
9195,"I 'm impressed by this story very much. His spirit of challenging is excellent and I think to do as he did. And, we need to take over his thanks to the earth."
9196,It is good idea for a lot of people to think about sexual minority. We can think about it in usual life.
9197,"I think he is very powerful person.It's great to be fine to climb the mountain, especially Everest. I want to follow the spirit of challenging in spit of age."
9198,"There are so many energetic elderly people in this world, especially in Japan. I wonder what their aims to live. Mr. Miura has some health problems, but he achieved his goals three times. If I can live healthy until 80 years old like him, I would like to go several countries, challenge the traditional dances of those ones and make friends around the world."
9201,"I was surprised to hear this story. I think he is wonderful mountaineer because he continues to exceed the limit. If I am 80 years old, I'd like to continue something habitually like him."
9203,"This story really encouraged me because I can know that 'even 80 years old' person can carry out marvelous thing. Learning from this story, I want to challenge difficulties like Mr.Miura."
9204,"I respect Yuichiro Miura because he overcame a serious injury again and again.When I broke my leg,I couldn't get motivated.I would like to ask him why he is so energetic.If I live a long life,I want to go on a trip to many countries and eat well.I should take care of my health."
9206,I can't believe the title at first because it's impossible the man who is 80 year-old climbs Mt. Everest. But my opinion changed when I finished reading this article. Mr.Miura is amazing person and I found we shouldn't decide our limit by our age. So I'd like to continue challenging until I die.
9207,I think he has never lost his passion through his life. I want to be a man like him.
9208,"I thought that Yuichiro Miura really likes climbing the mountain. It is because that he said 'one can never be happier,' when he climbed Mt Everest. I think that his passion of mountain is highly cool. I want to find something that I can be dedicated to my passion in like him."
9209,I was very surprised at the news because I cannot believe that 80 years old man succeed to climb the Mt. Everest and this Yuichiro Miura's success has cheered me up. I want to find something that I want to challenge in my life.
9211,"I was very surprised at this story that Mr.Miura succeed to climb the Mt.Everest.Especially,I think that the words he wrote on his expedition website can inspire many people who think their limits have come.I want to be a man like Mr. Miura."
9212,"I have heard this story before, and respected Yuichiro Miura before this lesson, because I like climbing too, and he is very famous climber. Through this class, I came to want to live my life like him, try anything, overcome any difficulties, and never give up."
9213,"It's not easy to climb Mt. Everest at age of 80 for ordinary people. I think keeping healthy body and continuing to play sports is difficult at his age, but the thing I impressed the most is that he still have an ambition and continues his challenge even his age is over 80. I can't imagine my life when I become 80 years old, but I hope I will have interests for many new things and try these things like Mr. Miura."
9214,It is admirable to challenge something new even as he become older. Will I have vitality similar to him when I become 80 years? I think maybe not. I'd like to go on keeping even one thing I can think I never lose.
9215,"I expect that there is a feeling which only a man who achieved the highest goal can feel.Mr.Mimura was struck by the feeling,when he reached the top of Mt.Everest,I though.I wanna be a man like him.."
9216,"We are very proud that Mr Miura who is Japanese broke the world record and challenged his limits. I learned that I must try to do my best more and must not decide my limits by myself. According to this article, Mr Miura's son climbed Mount Everest with his father. I think he may continue to tackle the mountain and be able to reach the peak at the age of 80 like his father."
9217,"I was very surprised to hear this news.I think I can't climb Mt Everest ,so I'm respect for Mr Miura. In addition to this, I want to have some purpose and make efforts like him."
9218,"I was very astonished by this news! I cannot imagine 80 years-old-man can climb up Everest successfully. If I were 80 years old, I think I am not able to keep challenging like Mr Miura. He definitely inspired many elderly and young all over the world. We need to keep up with our effort to reach our ultimate goals."
9219,It's very inspiring news for me that 80-year-old Japanese man has done such incredible thing. He didn't lose his passion for his own dream. It encouraged me to challenge my limit and achieve something.
9220,I respect Yuichiro Miura. He challenged his limit to climb Mt Everest. I would like to challenge my limit like him forever but it is difficult to do that when I get old. I remember him not to forget this spirit.
9222,I was impressed to read this article because I had not think that a man who was 80 years old was able to climb Everest. This article encouraged me to challenge a lot of things in spite of my age.
9223,"To challenge the own limit is very hard. But I think it is very important. Challenging the limit, we can improve ourselves. So he is great. He is challenging his limit, in spite of his age 80. I want to keep challenging my limit like him if I get old."
9224,"Miura Yuichiro is so good as a climber and a man. His story tells us that challenging the limit is very important. Although he is 80 years old, he tried his challenge hard. We are young and have much time to do something, so I thought I should tackle a lot of my problems hard."
9225,"The success of Yuichiro Miura climbing MT Everest gave me courage. Especially, I was moved when I found that he never gave up despite several times of injuries. From the article, I learned that there is never too late and the sky is the limit."
9227,"I think Mt.Everest is the most difficult mountain for us to climb in the world.It is also hard for young mountaineer to climb it.So his success is really brilliant.He could make it because he loves mountains.I think however old you are,it is important to keep pursuing your dream."
9228,"Yuichiro Miura is very powerful.After reading this article, I thought there was nothing we could not do if we wanted to do it.I felt it important to live with goals, and I want to do everything I wanted to do. Someday I would like to climb Mount Fuji."
9229,"I was very impressed by this article. From this article, I thought it was very important to try something even if you get older. There is nothing that you can't do because of your age. I want to keep trying something and work hard to make my dreams come true even when I get older."
9230,"I was impressed by Yuichiro Miura's posture to keep on challenging his limits. His passion made me realize that I ought to overcome difficult challenges no matter how old I become. I was sad when I heard of Min Bahadaur Sherchan's death, but I believe Miura will keep on challenging even without his rival."
9231,I was so surprised about that Mr Miura climbed Mt Everest at age 80. I don't think I can climb it even I am much younger than he is. Also What I respect about him is that he is continuously challenging something even he got old.
9233,"I was very impressed, when I read this article. Because it is not easy thing to climb Mt Everest at age of 80.And Yuichiro Miura overcame a lot of difficulty such as ill and injured. Additionally, I heard that climbing mountain is accompanied by danger. So I think that his spirit of continue challenging is worthy of respect."
9234,"I was very surprised at this news.Because if I were 80years old, I could not conquer the Mt,Everest. This news encourage me to challenge everything.I will have never forget Miura's passion."
9237,"To us ,definitely ,Yuichiro who never give up, is admirable.During our life , we usually or constantly think about three questions-who am I , where am I and where am I going to ,in other words - what is meanings of our lives and what can we complete in our life . I think Yuichiro has his own answer and finished those questions very well. Compared with Yuichiro most peoples still do not know their lives' meaning . From this point Yuichiro is admirable . And ,his persistency impressed me a lot . I think , I can learn a lot from him, especially from his spirit."
9239,I was surprised to read this article because 80years-old Japanese was able to reach the summit of Mt.Everest. I want to emulate his spirit of challenge.
9240,"I was impressed with this surprising news,80years-old Japanese"
9241,"men had reached the summit of Mount Everest. Needless to say,I think Mr.Miura has great mental powers. I want to learn his positive attitude and do my best for my purpose."
9242,I was very impressed by the news that 80 years old man reached the top of Mt. Everest. I think this news encouraged many people to challenge own limit.
9243,I was very surprised when I read this news. I think he trained very hard. This news gives us many things. I want to be like him.
9244,"I was really astonished how active Yuichiro Miura is in spite of his age and his fierce injury. Moreover, His passion to try everything and continue to do it moved my heart greatly. So I would like to find my goal and then accomplish it through my life."
9245,I was so surprised to hear this news because he is really great to achieve such a things at the age of 80. I can't imagine that I play some sports or climb mountains (even Mt.Fuji!) when I am 80 years old.
9246,I knew about Yuichiro Miura but it was surprised for me that he tries to climb the mountain even when he is 80 years old. Yuichiro Miura is proud of japan. I want to become like him who doing his best what he want to do.
9248,"I was so impressed and also surprised to read this article. I really respect him because he tries so hard to make his dream comes true. I want to be a person like him, who never gives up his dream and keep challenging."
9249,i was very surprised that the man who is 80years old climb Mt. Everest. i will never be able to do like this.
9250,"I was surprised at this story. Mr. Miura is much older than I ,but he has more passion than I. So I want to be the person like him."
9251,"When I read this article, I was very surprised at this achievement. I thought most of 80-year-old people cannot exercise actively but by reading this article, I found that human being can do anything whatever they want to achieve. These days, the problem of aging society is getting worse. I thought elderly people should model the life like Mr. Miura."
9252,"According to what I know, there are few people have ever climbed the Mt. Everest. Thus, I respect about Mr. Miura, who climbed the Mt. Everest at his 80. He is not only physically powerful, but also mentally powerful. I would like to be a person like him. Perhaps, I will never climb the Mt. Everest, but I believe I can learn a lot from his spirit."
9257,"I thought Mr.Miura is not only physically but also mentally strong. I'm not mentally strong so I respect him from the bottom of my heart. Mr.Miura loves climbing,and in my case I love rugby. I want to play rugby until I die. And one day I want to be on the newspaper just like Mr.Miura."
9259,"I was very surprised at this achievement.I can't still believe it. I have 2 point which should be respected for him. He trained physically even though he is 80.And he is very stoic mentally. I respect him like from the bottom at the heart.I'd like to be strong man like him,too. I'd like to talk with him ."
9260,"It is very good thing to continue challenging your limits, but it's also difficult to do so. l want to try my limits like him."
9261,"I really admire Mr Miura's strong will and high motivation to achieve his goal. Also, I was impressed by his positive attitude to tackle the difficulties, though he is not a young and strong man. I would like to try to climb the Mt Fuji someday to honor 'the great Mother Nature' as he did."
9263,"I think he was so brave. Though for young men conquering the Everest is so hard and dangerous, he, the 80 man challenged it. We cannot guess his feeling before the climbing, but he might have been so afraid by the risk of the death. I want to get a tough spirit and heart like his."
9264,"I really respect for his great achievements,so I really want him to continue his challenge.He is so cool and amazed many people.But these challenges are so dangerous,So anyway I really want him to take care of his body."
9265,"I was very surprised because I was watching the news that Sherchan died on the way of Mount Everest just two days before reading this article. I knew for the first time that the two were rivals. I was impressed by Mr. Miura's words, but I thought it was more impressed to have someone to compete with in his life."
9266,"I think that he is very powerful and passionate person. He has had passion through his life. I respect the dreamer like him, and want to be a man like him."
9267,"Now there are many people over 80 who want to do something in Japan. So his achievement is the hope for them.And I want to live a life like him that is to say, found and seek dream all my life."
9270,I was surprised at this story and this man . I thought that I want to live like this man.
9272,I am impressed from his challenge spirit. Mr Miura kept challenging to attack in front of walls. I am a hockey player. I think it's no finish to continue challenging for my limit. I'll keep challenging for my limit of hockey as Mr Miura.
9273,I thought he is the person having young spirit. His challenges cannot finish and will continue until his own body ran away.
9276,"I think that using renewable energy is a better way for Japan because nuclear energy is risky and may cause serious problems such as the disaster in 2011. However, the cost of using renewable energy is high for us and the amount of renewable energy we use is small. What we need now is making Geothermal energy more useful."
9277,"I think nuclear energy is very risky electric power supply system. As described in the article, Japan has a lot of volcanoes which can be used geothermal, so I also think we should use them effectively."
9278,"Radiation is very dangerous, so I think Japan should stop nuclear power generation. After taking place the eastern Japan great earthquake as an good opportunity Japanese realizes the fear of the radiation and is also suffering from fear now. I would like to live in a clean country, so I want Japan to use the clean energy with the environment."
9279,"In Japan, it's a controversial problem whether or not we should return nuclear power. Actually, nuclear power has risk, but we make a life that we can't live without a number of power. I think we should rethink our lives at first."
9280,"I think it's good idea to use volcanoes. You may have thought that volcanoes don't have only negative aspect but also positive one. They have tremendous power, so they should be used in a good way."
9281,"In my opinion, nuclear power energy should be stopped using.There are two reasons for this.Firstly, if there is a big disaster like Tohoku earthquake,there is possibility that hurts one's health. Health should be treated as the most important thing.In the second,as we can know it by this article ,there are some alternative power energy in Japan. For these reasons, I think we have to stop using nuclear power energy."
9282,"I think your idea is nice one. In Japan, there are many volcanoes ,so when we can use them as the source of energy ,it will benefit our society."
9283,"After the Fukushima disaster in March 2011, many people came to think that nuclear power is uncontrollable and risky one. Therefore, the Japanese government tries to promote renewable energy. Of course, if renewable energy could meet people's demand, it would be best solution for Japanese electricity's probleme.However, we should remember that nuclear power is sustainable way for the reason that it produce less greenhouse gasses and the nuclear power plant can create many employments and local public organization can get subsides.Threfore, we should think that nuclear power is just risky way.We should realize risk management."
9284,I agree with your plan.Japanese government should promote the renewable ways.
9285,"I think Japanese government should promote renewable energy because even if using nuclear power is cheaper,there is no point when you die because of nuclear power.I watched a movie 'Godzilla' in a class and felt a fear of radiation.We must remember the Fukushima disaster and not bring about such a thing again."
9286,"You explained advantages of nuclear power,but you said 'therefore,we should think that nuclear power is just risky way.'I don't understand the meaning of this sentence.It is a good idea to substitute but for therefore."
9287,"I think that Japanese government should improve renewable energy. Since 'Japan's geothermal potential is huge.' Some information shows that Japan have a lot of active volcanoes. Japanese area is only 0.25% of all the world area, however 7% of all active volcanoes are in Japan. By this figure shows the potential of Japanese geothermal energy. Moreover, I think that Japan have high potential of hydro energy. In Japan, there are a lot of rapidly rivers. These rivers are good for generation of electricity from hydro."
9288,"I do not support using nuclear power in Japan.I think using renewable energy is one of the best way,but there are some difficulties because we haven't prepared enough.Therefore,I want to permit the government to operate nuclear power station for some limited period."
9289,I quite agree with you. We should think not only about the way of power but also about the way of our life.
9290,"It's easy to say that we should stop relying on nuclear power. We all now that it's the best not to use nuclear power plant to generate energy, but I don't think Japan is prepared for doing so. As the fact that Japanese greenhouse gas emission climbed shows it. Some people saying geothermal would be the alternative to the nuclear but even after 6 years it's not becoming the alternative solution, We probably need more time to develop the technology to make the renewable energy cheap and reliable enough. Therefore, not forever but for a short amount of time Japan should use nuclear power until prepared."
9291,"I agree with your opinion. Nuclear energy is dangerous and risky ,so I expect effective use of geothermal power generation."
9292,"It's too facile to say that, because for not using the nuclear power plant, Japan is burning lots of coal and gas which is leading the air pollution. Air pollution is not only bad for our health but it also escalates global warming. Also, there is the fact that for more than 5 years renewable energy is not becoming the alternative energy of nuclear power. I think it's more complicated than how people think."
9293,"I don't agree with creating power from nuclear. Nuclear have huge power which surpass our scientific knowledge and technology. Actually, we don't need more power from nuclear and it was proved in 2011. However, it is not easy to stop it suddenly. There are many problems like how to manage nuclear fuel, how to crash the power plants in the future and so on. Also the time in 2011, Japanese have the feeling that let us save the amount of power o use and help Tohoku, but we lose that kind of feelings as time goes on. So, it might blackout. Like that, I always fall in paradox thinking and I can't choose which is good, continuing or stopping/"
9294,"I agree with your opinion. As you said, I think Japan is an exclusive country from LGBT people. I hope this situation will be improved and Japan will be nice country to live for every person. You said you didn't have gay friends, but I have. One of my host sister in USA is lesbian. She is so wonderful and nice person and she doesn't have any differences from us. Though I am not a lesbian and don't recognize the problem of gender equality, I strongly believe that we, people should be treated equal!"
9295,"My opinion is that we should use nuclear power. Of course, promoting renewable is important, however, the way of creating today's power is as important as that. So we need to think about now and future. Japan's technology is advanced and we can make the time of promoting renewable shortest. Then the risk of nuclear power doesn't increase. In conclusion, I agree using a nuclear power to gain time for developing renewable."
9296,"Returning to nuclear power do not fits Japan for several reasons. Firstly, nuclear power is still very risky to people, although it is more safe and stable than before.Secondly, Japan is a country, encounters earthquakes often, which also means that nuclear power is not suitable for Japan. Japanese government should pay more attention to renewable energy."
9297,"I think Japan should not use nuclear energy anymore, because it is a risky energy source, and I believe safety is a top priority. Instead, Japan has to promote other renewable sources. I suppose it is possible, because we have many active volcanoes that can be a substitute. Also, as the technology advances, we will be able to find other replacement of nuclear sources."
9298,"I definitely agree with your idea, 'We must remember the Fukushima disaster'. I think it was the worst natural disaster which nuclear power provoked. We should prevent such a disaster in advance."
9299,"After the Fukushima disaster,Japan faced a question that we cannot correctly answer.The question is should Japan turn the nuclear power back on?I think that Japan should do that.However,I don't mean that we may expose a part of people to danger.To turn the nuclear power back on.We should invent a completely safe nuclear power."
9300,"I think your opinion is ideal. However, Japan has to deal with electric problem as soon as possible.Making geothermal energy plants takes too much time.So I cannot agree to your opinion from the bottom of my heart."
9301,I think that renewable energy is safety so we should use it. However renewable energy is not efficient and we use nuclear power to make a lot energy. Nuclear power is dangerous and we should replace nuclear power with renewable energy.
9302,I agree with you. Nuclear power is dangerous so we promote renewable energy. It takes a lot of time but we should gradually go ahead.
9303,"As you know nuclear power is very dangerous, and it was cause of huge disaster in 2011. So we should think about the movement of returning nuclear power as a problem, and government should use so much time for effective energy such as geothermal, not the risky energy."
9304,"I disagree with some of your idea. I agree with nuclear power is dangerous and if we can live without it, that is better. However we need electric power to develop our life and economic. we can't save the power for a long time. Also if we quit using nuclear power, cost of electricity will be more expensive. If we can get rid of risks I am okay with rising cost, but there are people disagree with this. until we can find any good way to produce electricity, I think we should remain using nuclear power."
9305,"I think that the Japanese government should stop operating nuclear power plants and make efforts to develop alternative ways of generating electricity. The Great East Japan Earthquake has demonstrated that nuclear power is no longer reliable. Furthermore, it will be a burden on future generations. There is no point in keeping nuclear power."
9306,"In my opinion, Japanese government should not bring in the nuclear power. we already learned the risk of nuclear power from Fukushima disaster. when there was a radiation leak in the Fukushima nuclear plant, I was only 11 years old. However I clearly remember the confusion. And I knew that nuclear power was too risky to use. On the other hands, some people say that nuclear power is the cheapest system. But I think that we have to be prior the safety. Because nothing can take place in safety."
9307,I am in opposition to your opinion. Because we already learn the risk of nuclear power from Fukushima disaster. Of course Japanese technology will develop in the future. However I think that nothing can take palace in safety. Therefore I think that Japanese government should not bring in nuclear power.
9308,"I disagree with you. You only clime a good side of nuclear power. I think things always have both a good and bad side. Of course we know many merits of nuclear power. Japanese people believed that nuclear power generation is safe, as a government is told us. But after the accident in Fukushima happened, we have to focus on a bad side of nuclear power and make efforts to not use nuclear power."
9309,"Your idea is great. I changed my view toward volcanoes after reading your comment. As you said, it is important to make use of what are around us."
9310,"I agree with your opinion. as you mentioned above ,East Japan Earthquake indicate that nuclear power is no longer reliable and I think this also means that Japan is a country ,encountering earthquakes often , which also means nuclear power dose not fit Japan."
9311,I agree with your idea 'we need to think now and future'. Thinking only about 'now' may bring us to gangrenous future. Energy problem is not easy but we need to have a wide field of vision.
9312,I think that nuclear energy should be excluded in Japan. Because nuclear energy has high risks and there is some possibility of giving bad effect for human like a Fukushima. Japan can generate renewable energy is also main reason. So I think we reconsider the future of energy.
9313,"I agree your opinion. I clearly remember the Fukushima disaster. I thought the accident is never happened, safety is most important things in generating electricity energy. So if we encourage to generate renewable energy, I think reservation of safety is top priority."
9314,"I think that nuclear power is so risky that we should not rely on this too much. Ideally we should make power without using nuclear energy, but if we are to do so, we would be short of electricity. So things we must do now is making renewable energy like geothermal and developing it."
9315,I don't want to use nuclear energy. It is risky to use nuclear energy. But nuclear energy is cheaper than others. And it doesn't make greenhouse gas. So it is understandable that Japanese government want to use nuclear energy. We should think about energy which should we take safety or cheapness.
9316,"Just like you, I think it is important to make time for developing renewable energy. However, this can't be an excuse for relying on nuclear power. Nuclear power has potential of killing a lot of people."
9317,"I am so pleased to know such this serious condition through last class. We have to consider it from both aspects from economics and environment more diligently in order to survive NOW. If we make economics worth developing and keep ignoring the environmental affect the planet suffered,the existence of human beings itself will be threatened and,the worst,disappear ourselves. We only live on the earth."
9318,"In my opinion, Japan should let people know well about new renewable energy such as geothermal power and wave power. Japan has a lot of ways to generate renewable power as the article mentioned. However, few Japanese know the presence of it and most of them try to decide which is better, nuclear power generation or fossil fuel power generation. If more people get interest in various ways to produce electricity, it will be easy for the government to subsidize new renewable power and then it will be more popular in Japan."
9319,"I think we should replace nuclear power with renewable sources. The claim that ' nuclear power is cheap ' is based on the safety of the nuclear power, but the cost of Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster is huge as you know. I don't know whether or not geothermal power is the best choice, however it's clear that nuclear power is not the best choice."
9320,"I think that it is nice idea to use renewable energy which doesn't emit greenhouse gases and we should positively introduce renewable energy in various place. Especially in Japan, there are many national disasters so that we shouldn't expect to resume nuclear power generation. Therefore, we have to convert from conventional energy to renewable energy."
9321,"I think creating energy from nuclear power is definitely not good. It provoked the serious natural disaster in Japan. We must not forget the Fukushima disaster in 2011. We have to use other sustainable sources such us geothermal, hydro and solar, not risky sources. It may takes much time, but our government should set about improving this problem."
9322,I agree with the thought that we need to think about now and future. It's difficult to have wide views especially in the serious situation. Focusing on future will bring us better life.
9323,"Today we use many types of electronic energy,for example hydro wind solar and geothermal.These are good for the environment as renewable energy.But we can get small number of the electric energy,so we have to find the other way to generate energy.I think we have a good way,It's methane hydrate. The methane hydrate is iced methane which locates in the sea near Japan.This is developing now,so we'll be able to use it in 10 years I think."
9324,"I partially disagreed with your opinion. According to the article, 'Japan has been coping surprisingly well without nuclear power planet.' and 'The predicted blackouts did not happen. ' We can keep our electric power supply without nuclear power, so we should stop using nuclear power."
9325,"I think your opinion that nuclear power isn't best choice is right. However we need to buy time until renewable are developed now. Although thermal power generation is safety, it certainly break the environment. So we should bring nuclear power temporarily."
9326,It is very dangerous to use nuclear power because there are many earthquake in japan. I think we should use hydro energy more and more. There are many river in japan so it will be very effective.
9327,I think so too. We have to change the energy system. I don't want to leave the earth.
9328,"I disagree with you. Because nuclear power is so risky. We can make and get a lot of energy, but we should refrain from using it."
9329,"I don't think we should use nuclear energy if possible because there are many people who regard it as dangerous after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. I hope a renewable energy revolution will advance more and more. I suggest we generate electricity by biomass energy. It costs more money than coal and nuclear. However, not discharging carbon dioxide, it is environment-friendly. Of course, it is safe. And its materials such as domestic animals' droppings and the garbage of food exist everywhere, so we are not very limited the places which we can set up power plants."
9330,"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is about to try to turn the nuclear plants back on according to this article. Does he forget what has happened 6 years ago? The impact of the accident was so cruel and gruesome that many people can't forget it at all. Not to repeat the same mistakes, we have to take action and find the new ways to generate energy swiftly."
9331,I think we should use geothermal especially. Because Japan has 119 active volcanoes and geothermal is cheap. So we should stop using nuclear power and use renewable energy.
9332,"I think that now day, it is hard to produce enough electricity without unclear. However, Japan should find another ways to produce electricity more safely. I know that especially in European countries, so I think it is great to get some idea from these countries. Also it is important for each of us to try not to use too much energy in our daily life."
9333,I agree to your idea. Still now people in Fukushima are suffering from damages caused by rumors. We have to consider how to generate energy without destroying environment.
9334,"personally i think we should use nuclear power for now, because as long as we don't have any good way to get enough power, we cant live without nuclear plants. we can reduce risks, by producing energy by burning coals or those things, but it is too bad for environment. we also can produce electricity by geothermal, but its really depend on weathers, so we cant get enough electric power constantly. In addition, there are many people oppose to rising costs of electricity."
9335,"I think temporarily nuclear power is also very important. Nuclear power can supply a large amount of electric power steadily.It is appealing to other countries that Japan without resources has safe use of nuclear power.However, I think it is more important to supply a large amount of electricity with renewable energy in the future."
9336,"I agree with your opinion. I think renewable energy will be introduced widely in Japan. And, I also think Japan has geothermal potential as well, which is represented by volcano and river and so on. Furthermore, I believe solar energy is one of the most future energy too. In, Europe, solar energy is common so that Japanese government should also improve solar energy."
9337,I agree with your idea which says we have to consider about way of make energy from both aspects economic and environment. We tend to think more about environment than how much it is going to cost to make energy but these are both very important.
9338,"I think we have no choice but to depend on nuclear power.Ways of generating electricity from renewable need much time and money.It will take long time for renewable to replace nuclear power.And there are many nuclear power plants in Japan.Many people are working in nuclear power plants.If we stop using electricity from nuclear power plants,they lose their jobs."
9339,"I think it is better in the future to rely on renewable energy by reading your opinion.I thought it would be best if a method to safely use nuclear energy was found.However, considering the disaster in Fukushima, it may be better not to rely on nuclear power for those who feel hard."
9340,I agree with your opinion.We cannot stop using nuclear power plants immediately.Life without electricity is impossible.Steady supply of electricity is the most important.
9341,"The trend focusing on renewable energy in place of nuclear power seems really effective and kind to the environment. Thus I believe that it should be continued and pushed forward by the government. The government's argument to return to nuclear power which is cheaper and more reliable is convincing. However, when considering the risk of disaster that Japan faced in 2011, we should never use nuclear power again and start using more renewable energy for the safety of the country."
9342,I think nuclear energy should be stopped using because we experienced Fukushima disaster. So we cannot control nuclear energy safely.
9343,"I think we should not use nuclear energy because it's so dangerous to all livings in the world. For instance, Fukushima disaster in March 2011 brought us many serious problems by nuclear power. So I think we should save more electricity. We have used too much electricity to live."
9344,I think so too. Geothermal energy is the most practical energy source
9345,"I think it is good idea to use methane hydrate. We should find some better ways to generate electricity which are safe, environment-friendly, and so on by trying many ones as soon as possible."
9346,"I agree with you, because geothermal energy seems like the promising and reliable energy source."
9347,I agree with your idea. Japanese government must choose safety or cheapness. It's so difficult. I choose safety in my opinion. I think it's the most important for us.
9348,"Personally, I think using nuclear energy is a efficient way to generate electricity. However, we need to focus on safety. We have experienced the Fukushima disaster and we know how dangerous to generate electricity by nuclear power plants. As it mentioned in this article, we have more options. Sustainable energy will be a great choice and it is healthy for the planet, too."
9349,Exactly. We should never forget the Fukushima disaster. There are still people who suffers from it. Safety must be the top priority.
9350,"Good point. Renewable energy is healthy for the planet, too. We have to use sustainable resources to keep our precious planet!"
9351,"I know what you are saying. Safety should be the top priority. However, do you think generating electricity from renewable energy is the BEST choice? If you focus on the cost, nuclear power is considered as the most economical way. On the contrary, renewable energy is inefficient and it involves a great deal of costs."
9352,"Your opinion is very realistic. Considering about the accident in the past, I think we should not use nuclear plant any more, but we don't have alternative energy that provide energy for our life stably now. I hope we can fined new energy sources in near future which don't threaten safety and environment."
9353,"I agree your opinion. Especially, I confirm 'there are many national disasters so that we shouldn't expect to resume nuclear power generation. '.I think we have to learn the risk of nuclear power from past natural disaster experiences. Japan should utilize good points for energy production such as geothermal power."
9354,"In my opinion, I think we should stop using nuclear energy. It's true that using nuclear energy produces cheap energy but it's too risky such as Fukushima disaster. However, we cannot stop using nuclear energy immediately because most of the energy in Japan is produced by the nuclear. Since there are lots of volcanoes in Japan, we should use geothermal energy. However, using geothermal energy is probably not enough to produce all the energy in Japan. Therefore, until the technology of the geothermal gets high, we should use nuclear."
9355,"I really like your opinion,however I disagree with your opinion.Because nuclear power makes much of the electricity in Japan.So if we stop it,we're going to be in the energy problem.Therefore we have to wait using renewable energy when it gets developed."
9356,"I think that too. But nuclear energy is cheap and clean. If there are no accident ,nuclear energy is useful. So I think we should research how to make nuclear energy safety."
9357,"I agree with your idea that nuclear should be replaced with renewable. However, we need much more time to produce all the energy in Japan by using renewable. So it's not possible to stop using nuclear immediately. It can't be helped using the nuclear until the renewable get developed."
9358,"i feel surprised when i read this article and doubt why japan use the renewable energy much more. surely it cost much money. but in the future, the gas and fossil fuels will not exists. we must change the energy system."
9359,i think so. nuclear energy is too risky. i think that solar energy must be used.
9360,"I think that Japan should not rely on nuclear power any more, because it's too dangerous for our life, as we felt through the great east Japan earthquake, 'Fukushima disaster'. Japan should focus its policy on renewable energy. I know it takes so much time and cost, but we must change. If the renewable energy is not enough to cover Japan's consumption of electricity, we can create new way to generate electricity, such as 'step energy' on the road or station."
9361,"I think your opinion is true, too, because we can't pay so much money to save environment, and it is clear that renewable energy can't cover our consumption of electricity now. However, we should not cause such terrible disaster again. We can create new way of generating electricity, and such studies are progressing. So, we can hope better world with no nuclear power, no risk, but with a new way of generating electricity."
9362,"Nuclear power is very reliable. Most major way to generation power, coal and oil power generation has some problem-for example, cost, influence of environment. Countries which has few resources -Japan- should have to depend on nuclear power.But as you know, nuclear power has risk , too. It is unavoidable for us who live in Earthquake-prone. In fact, the time we consider Japanese power generation comes."
9363,"I agree with you. We have to find another ways to generate. I think European countries put effort on Renewable energy. However, we have different situation of resource from them. It is difficult point in this, isn't it."
9364,"I felt renewable energy is important for Japan.But I think nuclear energy is also important because it is cheap and can produce a lot of electricity.Acutually,nuclear energy is risky and dangerous,but we can protect nuclear reactors from natural disasters by Japan's technology so we don't have to care about disasters."
9365,"There were many people said that the gas and fossil fuels will run out. But now, few expert still claim that the gas and fossil fuels will run out. You can notice the price of oil, and you will know that. It may be reasonable for President Trump saying he will use more coal and oil again."
9366,"Nuclear power cannot be replaced by renewable energy in a short time. After shutting down using nuclear power, Japanese government used more goal and oil, which will emit more greenhouse gases. It seems that renewable energy cannot replace the nuclear power, thus goal and oil are used to replace the nuclear power. Perhaps renewable energy will be more cheaper and more easy to use, but not in close future."
9367,"Although there may be a problem of danger, I think that a nuclear power plant is necessary in reality. If this disappears, it depends on most of the thermal power generation, predicting mass consumption of oil and a drastic rise in electricity price accompanying it.Nuclear power generation should cease if it is possible to supply power all over Japan without nuclear power generation. but nuclear power generation is necessary until alternative plans and alternative energy are born because the current situation is inevitable."
9368,"I disagree your opinion. Actually,Fukushima disaster has occurred and it was a terrible incident, but we can protect nuclear reactors from natural disasters because Japan has high-technology which is useful for nuclear energy. So we don't have to care about natural disasters and our safety."
9369,"I disagree with your opinion with 3 reasons. First, renewable energy is too hard to use. Second, more rapid rivers never means more hydro energy. In geographical view, it is not suitable for Japan using hydro energy because rivers in Japan are so short and rapid that is too hard to be a reliable supply of energy. Third, there are no evidence shows renewable energy is safe but some evidences show renewable energy is also dangerous. For example, Three Gorges Dam in China generate a lot of electricity. However, it also destroyed the environment of the Yangtze River. Fish in the Yangtze River have to change their life style or die. I believe it will affect human indirectly."
9370,"We often discuss about danger. but I think that the danger when generating electricity is not only nuclear power generation. Even though such power generation is ordinary, but how can we oppose to nuclear power generation?When it comes to a dangerous situation, the damage may be great. but I think that it is also a safe way of generating electricity"
9371,"I think that the nuclear power is important resources. Certainly, nuclear power is dangerous.But,we need it. The renewable energy is not efficient and need high cost. We imposed creating high safety nuclear system."
9372,"I agree with your opinion. I think that the nuclear power is important resources. Certainly, nuclear power is dangerous.But,we need it. The renewable energy is not efficient and need high cost. We imposed creating high safety nuclear system."
9373,I agree with you. I think geothermal energy is the most effective way to generate the energy.
9374,"I think geothermal energy is the most important energy resource for Japan. Japan has a lot of volcanoes than other countries, and this energy is sustainable than other energy sources."
9375,"I agree with the conditional use of nuclear power. That condition means that there is a technology that can safely throw used fuel away. If we can do these things, I think that we may allow nuclear power. Also, I think that it is contrary to nuclear power is actually impossible,because other power is unstable supply."
9376,"I think your opinion is impossible. As you say, it is impossible for the public to forgive that it takes a huge cost to increase renewable energy usage. My idea is now,to make both nuclear power and sustainable energy compatible at the moment and that nuclear power alone may be sufficient if the technical strength rises."
9377,I agree to the part of your opinion. But we should trust power of Japanese more. Japan gets over any difficulty by researchers effort. LIFE can't exist without our home planet the earth.
9378,I think using renewable energy is good idea. But there are also many cases that we should pay attention. So we have to consider the future and be advancing.
9379,I think so .
9380,Geothermal is one of the ways to generate energy.Energy generated from geothermal accounts only 0.3% of the amount of energy of Japan despite Japan has the third largest potential of Geothermal in the world. Because there are many negative impact that geothermal has such as running out of spring water and destruction of scenes and difficulty of technique. So We have no choice but to depend on thermal power generation now.
9381,"It is important that we get along with planet. It is true that the nuclear power give us big energy with small resources. However produce energy with breaking the environmental will be not able to keep. The end will come someday. To keep making an effort for our planet, The planet tell us good way to get along with. For example the feed-in tariff."
9382,Certainly nuclear plant provide us with energy constantly. However there is a possibility that the second Fukushima disaster may happen by enormous earthquake or attack of ballistic missile of north Korea . Nuclear plant is what is to say double edge sword. So it is difficult to decide whether we should continue to run nuclear plant.
9383,I agree with your opinion. I always think the big disaster by human such as 'Fukushima disaster' will have to be not repeated. It is possible and duty to create new way to generate electricity.
9384,"After the disaster of Fukushima in 2011, Japan has been running well without nuclear power . But it is true that we emit more green house gases by burning more coal and gas. So I think we need renewable and reliable energy sources such as solar ,tidal, and geothermal. We have to search the way to get along with the earth which last for a log time for our next generations."
9385,"Of course it is true that renewable energy source is unstable,but I feel much fear about operating nuclear plants again in Japan. The accident may happen if we use nuclear power. Our history proved it. But it is also true that Ukraine is trying to operate nuclear power again after the disaster of Chernobyl because of the lack of energy. So we can't easily decide whether we should abolish nuclear or not."
9386,"I partly agree with you. Surely it is the best way to use nuclear power for Japan now in an aspect of its employment and efficiency. However, Japan should advance the development of new energy in order not to use any nuclear power in the future."
9387,"I don't agree that government will return the nuclear power. Though it is hard that other way compensate the nearly 30% of power from nuclear, we should facilitate renewable power especially solar power. Because we have any room to install solar panels."
9388,"I disagree with your opinion. Actually, the nuclear power happen Fukushima disaster. Also, the nuclear power isn't good for the environment. Now we need to protect the earth, we should push forward the protection the green."
9390,"I feel my shortage of sleep especially after I enter the university. I have begun to live alone this spring, so I have too many new thing what I have to do by myself. I want to establish new life style as soon as I can. Then, I want to sleep for a long time."
9391,"They repeat carry out a nuclear test quite often this year. We have to watch movement not only of North Korea but also of USA, because when the president of USA decides to take some sanctions, Japan may be affected. I'm terrible about the thought of North Korea's leader."
9392,"I agree with one of your ideas that nuclear power energy is essential for the present time of Japan's energy. But, just 'waiting' until renewable energies develop and we can use them easily isn't good. What university students can do is a little thing. However we need to have more attention and have own opinion to this problem."
9393,"Do you know that same-sex marriage was accepted in Taiwan yesterday? I also think everybody should be tolerant towards them. Nevertheless, if you look at the real society, not everyone is kind to LGBT people. What do you think we should do to further improve the current situation?"
9394,Exactly. We really need to focus seriously on this issue.
9395,I firmly believe we should have respect towards them. This is an issue that should be dealt with.
9396,"Diversity, good aspect. I also believe that we should keep discussing on this problem. We need to have correct knowledge and recognize how serious it is."
9397,"Especially, countries in Asia is sensitive about the religions. Tattoo can be a big problem. We should keep learning about other cultures in order not to have problems like this again."
9398,That is one way to improve the situation. learning religious views at school will be very effective!
9399,"I think we need to have respect towards them, too. I liked your example. As a Japanese, it may be difficult to understand the concept of God. Even if it is difficult, we need to learn more about others."
9400,"I was quite surprised by this news, too. However, there are actually some people who believes in such religion. For those who worship particular religion, do you think they should keep every rules and customs of other religions when they go to foreign countries?"
9401,Exactly. I cannot imagine what I can do when I became 80 years old. We need to keep challenging the limits from now on.
9402,I think challenging our limit is a difficult thing. We definitely need to keep our challenging spirits in order to accomplish our goals in the future.
9403,"yeah, he is powerful. There is nothing we cannot do. Do you have a dream? As you already mentioned, living with a goal will make your life bright. I wish you can climb up Mt. Fuji successfully."
9404,"I know, he is great. What do you like to do when you become 80?"
9406,"Mechanization is very natural in capitalism aiming to more profit, and for that reason efficiency. So, I feel discomfort with critic statement. One company isn't responsible for it. And, Will the time machine completely replace human being come? Conclusion by machine depend on reason. But real human live with also feeling. And seeing the history so far, we figure out that many job disappear for mechanization but many job was born for mechanization. Will machine replace human being? No. I think jobs that fit with periods only create."
9409,"I'm worried that who is responsible for accidents which self-driving cars cause. If the number of victims in traffic accidents will decrease,it is best.So,I agree to the Google's attitude.However there are a lot of problems with the introduction of self-driving cars into societies,I think."
9410,"It was such a shocking news for me that Trump was elected. Somewhere in my head I believed that Hilary Clinton would win. I think most of the people thought so too, and even now I think he is not qualified to become a president. It's for me ridiculous to choose someone who is an absolute amateur as a leader of your own country. I understand that some people in United States had frustration against Obama, but that doesn't mean the person who is far different from Obama is the one to elect. American people needed to think twice before voting."
9411,"I don't know manners of other countries too. So when I go abroad,I will look up the manners of the foreign country."
9412,"As technology is progressing, our lives is becoming more convenient. There is a recent tendency that technology is taking human's place. But I worry that technology might rob people of their jobs. I don't agree with Amazon's new idea in this article very much because the number of people who can work may decrease by a decline in employment. And I also suppose that the presence of clerks and cashiers keeps stores safe and brings us trust."
9413,I think so too. There are many people who don't believe any religion in Japan. So I think we are not sensitive to such a religious problem.
9414,I was surprised that you used to live in Thailand. I would like to live in a foreign country and touch the foreign culture.
9415,"I agree with you. We don't know the religious taboo, so we should study that.In addition, I think that all countries have to make the rules public not to repeat such a story."
9416,"I agree with you. As you said, Japan could run well without nuclear power for a while, so we also should make an effort to reduce the consumption of electricity not to use so much energy until renewable energy replaces nuclear power and thermal power."
9417,"Thank you for replying. I think this problem is thought with money is not good. Of course, money is very important things when we think policy. But this problem involve life of people. When comparing electricity from renewable energy and nuclear power, which is important is obvious? So I want to encourage generating electricity by renewable energy ."
9418,I agree with your opinion. But I have one question. Do you think we should leave nuclear plants in japan? I think nuclear energy is a efficient way to generate electricity too. but nuclear plants is dangerous is obvious. Moreover it has possibility of killing people. So I think that nuclear energy should be excluded in Japan. I am waiting for your reply.
9420,I think it is the best future to generate a large amount of electricity with renewable energy.Of course we cannot supply all the electricity with them now.Thus we rely on the nuclear energy.However nothing take the place of safety.Therefore I think that we shouldn't use nuclear energy.
9421,"Thank you for replying.In my opinion, Japanese government should promote to use renewable energy.Thus we don't need to rely on the risky nuclear energy.Of course achieving this goal needs a lot of time.However we never cause such a tragedy again and create safety future."
9422,You say that to treat LGBT people as special isn't good. But I think that it is needed to treat all people equally.
9423,I think so too. I think that he encouraged many people especially who retired at mandatory age
9424,I agree with you. Nuclear power is dangerous so we should replace nuclear power with renewable energy over a long time.
9425,"As you said, it is difficult to replace nuclear power with renewable energy but I think that we have to do that even if takes how much time."
9426,I agree with your opinion. We notice the risks of nuclear power. We should make the most of advantage of Japan.
9427,"As you said, Yuichiro Miura encouraged us a lot and it is important to live with goals. We can't accomplish anything without setting a goal and trying to achieve it."
9428,"As you mentioned, his spirit of continuing challenging should be praised. Keeping challenging is always hard both mentally and physically. However, Yuichiro Miura encouraged us a lot and made us realize the importance of believing in ourselves."
9429,"I think your opinion is great. Of course, I am afraid of terrorism, but is terrorism all responsible for Muslim? A lot of people, especially Japanese, know a little about Muslim. The first thing we have to do is trying to understand them."
9431,"I have same idea with you. In japan, there are still many people don't think about same-sex couples very well.There are many kind of people so we have to think for others more and more."
9432,I'm agree to your idea very well. i want to see the traffic light in Japan. We don't know a lots about LGBT people. It will be good chance to know about them.
9433,"I agree with Bill Gates in some points.I believe that climate change will not be able to be solved without cooperation of every country.Of course,most polluting country have to take measures to stop,but I firmly believe that every country including developing countries that emit less pollution for 'now',compared with other countries because these countries will emit in the near future in order to develop.However,in my above opinion,there is a contradiction.If some treaty will take the right of developing countries to grow its nation,that is really inequality. I think this kind of contradictary opinions are probably rose from the contradiction of 'capitalism'.In this system,the rich will be much richer and then the poor will be taken much more.Alas,in this system,we may not solve climate change completely."
9434,"To some extent I agree with you.In immediate future renewable energy can not replace the traditional energy.Because, techs of utilizing renewable energy are not stable,And consider the cost problem , traditional energy is cheaper than renewable energy."
9435,"I think your idea is very good. You will try your best if you get old. So I want to challenge my limits like him, but it's not climbing for me."
9436,"I support your opinion. We have lots of potential ways to generate renewable energy, as the article says. I think we should make efforts to use renewable energy."
9439,"I was really proud of my country's cuisine when I read this news. According to this article, Washoku is healthy and tasty compared with other cuisine in many countries. Despite of this virtue, people in Japan tend to have less opportunity to eat Washoku, which is called 'food westernization'. I think we should eat more Washoku from the point of our health."
9441,I think so too.I want to challenge my limit but climbing is too hard. So I want to challenge my limit by other ways.
9442,I think your opinion is ideal. Nuclear power is important. But we must take dangerous situation into consideration.
9443,"I think so too,because nuclear energy is too dangerous.So in the future we have to let them decrease with using renewable energy."
9445,I partly disagree with your view. Geothermal power is very important and the field Japanese are good at. But I think that the way which we generate power most efficiently is the solar power. Because it is easier to spread than the geothermal power. Japanese government should promote to install the solar panels.
9446,"Thanks for your reply. I know it is not completely safe. But my point is that there is no such alternative way that we can generate great deal of electricity at the moment. Electricity is inevitable to our daily lives, in other words, we cannot live without it. To be realistic, using renewable energy is not the best choice. However it doesn't mean that safety is not important. As you already mentioned, I also think that safety is the top priority. I hope that in the near future, we meet the time when we can abandon nuclear power and generate electricity by renewable energy instead."
9448,"I disagree with you. You said that 'the nuclear power isn't good for the environment.' But actually, the nuclear power is good for the environment. So we should use more nuclear energy to protect the earth."
9449,"I agree with your opinion. We will never repeat the Fukushima disaster. As you said, we have a lot of space to establish solar panels It is not late to return the nuclear power after to establish solar panels."
9450,"It was so surprising for me that Trump was elected. This time, both candidates were not right person. However, people should not have voted for Trump, because he had never been involved in politics, just a business man. Today's world affairs are very complicated, and we need corporate with other countries. But he just think about the US only, especially industry in his country. People feel frustration like many Americans, so I hope that people will vote for better candidates with deep thoughts."
9451,It was so amazing that Trump have been elected the next president of the United States. Because Trump's saying is reverse of the global affairs. I am worry about the future of our world.
9452,"I was surprised at this news, too. If my position, I have to choose the life of my father or my boyfriend. I can't compare with two people, because the importance of life of two people are the same. I think this question is not appropriate especially for the students of law who should have sense of justice."
9453,"I agree to 'It's a part of capitalism, that there's going to be this continuous drive for more efficiency'(said Ford).In capitalism,we basically seek more profits,and this movement certainly did bring great development in our lives.But I think this is the past,and we have to look at the future.AI is very sophisticated,so it is certain that we will be take our jobs by AI.After AI would spread all over the world,what were to happen? I think AI will think that people is weak,unreasonable,useless thing if we will still do foolish things.So,I think we as a human being have to cooperate!"
9454,"I also misunderstood burkini for hijab.After I read this article, we shouldn't connect between terrorism and the burkini directly.We all human have equal right,so we have to have more mercy over other people's religion.More over,if we would be hostile to all Muslim,we could not be cooperate with them against terrorism."
9455,I agree with your idea. Geothermal is not enough to make enough energy that nuclear did. We should use nuclear until renewable sources are developed.
9456,"Even though same sex marriage is familiar in foreign countries, it's not in Japan. We should respect individual human right and make laws to allow the same sex marriage."
9457,"Increasing the number of elderly people and decreasing the number of young people will cause many problems in Japan. For example, pensions and decreasing the number of working people. This gives Japan a huge economic impact. We should make it easier for the elderly people to work even they are over 65 years old."
9458,"I think that Japanese have to change the style of working. In Japan, there is a proverb that is'適材適所'. This proverb means right place, right people. By elderly people and young people working in right place, right people, Japanese economy and society will be getting better."
9459,"I think the increasing of the aged is the most important problems which we have to solve. As the globalization has evolved, a lot of foreigners came into Japan and then some problem are generated. For Japan , the foreigners are regarded as the work force,but from the point of ethics we should rethink the treatment of them."
9460,I totally agree with you. I think people are so when they are in midst of religious war. They should understand diversity each other.
9464,"I agree with your opinion.In my opinion, Japanese government should promote to use renewable energy.Thus we don't need to rely on the risky nuclear energy.Of course achieving this goal needs a lot of time.However we never cause such a tragedy again and create safety future."
9465,"As you said, what we need is the chance to understand minorities well. The Japanese government need to set the environment for us."
9466,"As you said, traffic lights are something that every person sees without fail. It is important to make people aware of the existence of minorities. We should be active to learn about them, not to be passive."
9467,"As you said, traffic lights are essential and we see them almost everyday. So it is a very efficient way to make people aware of minorities. I am looking forward the day that Japan become open to minorities."
9468,"As you said, many people don't have correct knowledge about minorities. What we fear the most is ignorance, so it is important to make people aware of social problems and make an environment to think deeply about how we the society should be."
9469,"As you said, we consider homosexual people special. However, that's wrong, and they should be treated just like everyone else. For achieving the ideal society, we should try to understand them and make the majority aware of thinking from the point of the minority."
9471,"As you said, LGBT issues seen to be apprehended negatively compared with other countries. In my opinion, it is due to the lack of knowledge about them. We shouldn't treat minorities badly just because that is what adults do. We should contemplate and think what is needed in order to our society open to everyone."
9472,"As you said, we should keep in mind that different countries have different manners. We should put ourselves in others' shoes."
9473,"As you said, Japan will host people from all over the world in 2020.It means that the risk of misunderstandings between people will increase. We should consider the religious problems seriously in order not to offend other cultures."
9476,"I have finished my homework,but I couldn't submit it because of electronic error. What should I do?"
9478,"Because search engines are convenient, you have to be careful with usage. Freedom of expression should be respected, but it is not good to hurt other people's dignity. We should study more correct knowledge."
9479,"I partly disagree with your opinion. I think that nuclear power should be abolished and we had better adopt renewable power. Installing them is difficult, but we can do it. Especially we have room to install the solar panels. I think that solar energy should be promoted."
9481,"I think you are right .Miura should be respected, for not only his physical power but also his mental power."
9482,"I am interested in energy problem.In the future, the resources will be disappeared. We should think this problem deeply."
9483,"I've been to New Zealand when I was a high school student. There were so many kinds of people like Maori, Chinese and European. I was really impressed because each of their culture wasn't opposed to. The design of flag is maybe important, but I think we can tell next generations about the history of New Zealand with the flag we use now. So"
9486,"I think that Japanese should continue to inherit the kanji skill. It is because kanji is the important Japanese culture. Government should strengthen the kanji education in junior high school and high school. Through the high level education, Japanese can acquire the kanji skill completely."
9487,"I can't completely agree with you because producing nuclear energy also doesn't emit greenhouse gases. Actually there are many natural disasters in Japan, however, we can protect nuclear plants from natural disasters. So nuclear power is also good for the environment and we should use not only renewable energy but also nuclear energy to protect the earth."
9488,"I agree with you. In your case you love rugby, and in my case I love hockey. I'm a member of the hockey team of the 'TAIIKUKAI'. The Practice is so hard that I sometimes want to give up. However the climbing for Mr Miura is the hockey for me. So I'll never give up and continue to play hockey until I die like Mr Miura."
9490,"Recently, the tension between the US and North Korea is getting higher. This problem concerns Japan because the US army in Japan will attack North Korea and North Korea will attack Japan. Therefore, we must consider our security."
9494,"I was surprised to hear this news because I think killing is overdoing. It is true that using and selling drugs are crimes and bad manner. However when it comes to punishing them, I think that we don't have to kill them. They have fundamental human rights and they are also victims of inequality of world' s economy. So, we have to think another better ways in order to get them back into society and to make them have better lives."
9495,"I was surprised when I read this article,and I would like to criticize the action of hackers. Certainly, in the field of sports, all athletes must play fairly, so it is not good to use restricted drugs. However, hacking is illegal thing. I don't think it is right to expose unfair practices by committing crimes.I think there was better another way to expose it."
9496,"Donald Trump announced that US will withdraw from the Paris agreement which is an international rule of global warming countermeasures. This is agreed by more than 100 countries for the future of the earth. Prime ministers of many countries are criticizing this decision. Also, Donald Trump said that global warning has not occurred. I think it is doubt. I hope this problem is solved."
9497,"Donald Trump paused the acceptance of refugees and strengthened immigration regulations. By this influence, the interpretation America does not welcome travelers from foreign countries has spread and the number of travelers from overseas has drastically decreased. He hit the American tourism industry directly."
9498,"I surprised when I hear the news that Trump became a president of the US. Surely, Trump has movement ability. He did something that he said in the pledge including separation from agreement of Paris. American may expect him to change the their life and they elected him. In Japan Japanese will not elect the person like Trump because Japanese mind vindicating. I felt the difference of the culture between Japan and the US."
9499,"I think death penalty shouldn't be abolished.Firstly, the death penalty is the effective incentive which can stop some crime. Secondary, for the people who killed someone, the death penalty is the thing that he should be sentenced.However ,as the case like this is existed, we have to consider seriously about the each case and the each reasons that trigger the crime and then we should decide weather we sentence the death penalty the criminal."
9500,"I agree with your opinions. I think that people's lives is equal too, so all of their lives should be saved. If I were in the same situation ,I would considered the best idea. I would like to be a brave man any time."
9503,I was surprised when I read this article. One my surprise point is that she completed the marathon though only walking is hard for paralyzed people. Her strong will is respectable.Other my surprised point is the potential of this suit. I do not expect that there is such a thing. This suit will apply many things.
9504,"I think taking doping substances should be restricted strongly. If an athlete win a gold medal in Olympic when he took medicines for doping, he doesn't win by himself, so the hacker did a good job. However, it is likely that the fact is doubt, so people mustn't believe what internet says Immoderately. We have to wonder whether news is true or false."
9505,"We will hold the Tokyo Olympic in 2020. We need to think about how to prevent doping as soon as possible. If a player who take medicines for doping is found, Japan's trust will be gone."
9506,"I totally agree with your idea that it is important for each of us to try not to use too much energy in our daily life. It is true that what the Japanese government have to do is invest in renewable energy. However, it is also every citizen's duty to save the amount of energy to use."
9507,I totally agree with you. Nuclear power is probably the most efficient and stable way to generate electricity if there are NO EARTHQUAKES. The Japanese government should look for other ways of producing electricity that match the geological features of Japan.
9508,"I partly agree with you. Ideally speaking, the Japanese government should stop the operating of nuclear plants right now. However, it is just impossible. It is true that we should try not to rely on nuclear power too much, but alternative ways to generate electricity is yet to be established. We still have to use a nuclear power before renewable power become practical."
9509,"Thank you for the reply. Nuclear power is good from the economic point of view and it is why the Japanese government is promoting nuclear power. However, as you said, nuclear power just doesn't fit Japan. Safety should be the first priority."
9510,"Thank you for the reply. We have to think about what other people, especially those who are directly influenced by nuclear power would think about."
9511,"Thank you for the reply. Yes, we have to make use of what are around us and not to rely on nuclear power."
9512,"The rate of birth is declining in japan year by year. One of the reason why the rate of aging people is increasing is this. Certainly, we should think the way to create a society where old people can work. But I think the way to increase the rate of birth is more important. We have the problem we must deal with concerning this. For example, problem of women's social advancement. Our future is depend on future of youth. We have duty to make the social where the young can work vitally."
9513,"I totally agree with you. Ideally speaking, the Japanese government should stop operating nuclear plants. However, if we were to do that, Japan would become chaos due to the lack of electricity.The best way we can do is keep running nuclear plants and develop alternative ways of generating energy at the same time."
9514,"I agree with your idea. As you said, the huge disaster happened in 2011 is enough to claim that nuclear power is no longer reliable. The Japanese government should reconsider the returning nuclear power. The safety should be the first priority."
9518,I think your point of view is right. We must not forget the Fukushima disaster. However we have to improve renewable simultaneously and take time to do it. So it need for us to search for the best way in order to solve those two problems.
9519,It's important to make renewable advance. But I can't see your opinion about nuclear power. I want to know that.
9520,I agree your opinion. I have same idea your last sentence. It needs for us to consider two problems that are the risk of nuclear and the state of renewable at the same time. So we should use nuclear power now.
9521,"Though this material was written five years ago, the movement of North Korea comes to regard as dangerous recently. Taking this situation into consideration, Japan introduced 'J Alert System' and announced some plans for missiles. This tendency makes me feel danger of attack familiar. We have to think how to solve this problem restfully and realize peaceful world ."
9522,"I think piracy is very serious problem because it deprives dignity of musicians. Almost musicians make musics with their passion. Though people download illegally and it makes musicians sadness and vexation. Also it is rude act. Then if you really like a musician, you download the music legally."
9524,'People's lives are equal.' This is just an ideal and hypocrite opinion. What if the question was whether to save the person you don't even know or to save your mother. Definitely all of the people would choose to save their own mother. The idea of 'All the lives are equal' is just a dream.
9526,"I was really moved by her never-give-up mind when I read this material. If I was in her situation, I would be disappointed about everything and lose my enthusiasm for running. Moreover, I really felt that an improvement of technology comes to enable what people couldn't before. Though it seems that technology will be changed for the better from now on, we have to realize that we'll be in the convenient world and should not rely on such situation too much."
9527,"I think we should not judge people by their appearance, because we can't understand his character only by his appearance. My friend's face is scary, but she is very kind of me. It is not good to convince that all Muslim are related to terrorism. However, I can understand what French people are thinking. Japan has banned that people with tattoo can't go swimming in pools and enter hot springs. I agree with this idea. This problem is hard to solve."
9528,"I have heard that some people regret globalization, too. However, I think globalization is convenient as expected, so I want children to think so and promote globalization. In order to develop the world, we should do our best in this era."
9529,"I felt that this incident is terrible. One man killed two people to suicide himself. Namely two innocent people were killed for losing Isohi's life. However, I do not think death penalty should be abolished. It is because certainly there is effect to restrain crimes."
9531,"I think Chinese National Exam is inappropriate. Lawyer should be distant from discrimination, but that exam includes sexual discrimination. Law is not perfect, so I hope lawyer would have adaptable thought."
9532,I am quite agree with you.Because I think nothing can take the place of safety.Of course we cannot supply all the electricity with renewable resource now.However I think that we shouldn't use nuclear energy.
9534,I agree to President Obama's opinion. Because human rights of all people should be perceived. But this problem seems to be dealt with negatively in Japan compared with other countries. It is true that there is difficulty in accepting new customs. But Japanese government should approve same sex marriage getting onto the international wave.
9536,"Muslim women have rights to enjoy swimming in the sea as well as French women.If French people continue to ban Muslim women from wearing burkinis,it is a invasion of their rights.Now it is usual to see foreign people in our neighborhood.We should make efforts to try to understand different religions"
9538,I agree with you. We are young enough to do anything. There are nothing too old to do. I want to keep challenging.
9539,I was very impressed too. Yuichiro Miura don't have limits. I want to be like him and learn the mind of never give up.
9540,i think all people have the right of enjoying swimming. so i think the Muslim women must be enjoy swimming. France is good country. i want to swim in the sea in France!
9543,"I was very excited to know this news, because I'm interested in technology, especially Artificial Intelligence. So I'm looking forward that autonomous cars actually be made. Some problem will be left, but autonomous cars can save millions of lives, and reduce traffic fatalities. I think there are more advantages than its disadvantages."
9544,"I think that his way again the drugs is not correct. All criminals need to reflect on their own sin and reform. So, as Duterte does, to kill the criminals is to snatch their chance away from them."
9545,I agree with your opinion. Nuclear energy is cheap and can produce a lot of electricity more than any other energy. There are many people working at nuclear plants so I think we should help them by keeping running nuclear plants.
9546,"After reading this article, I thought same-sex couples should be allowed as Mr. Obama said so. In Japan, in general, there might be less same-sex couples than America. In my opinion, this is because it has mixed culture and American have the heart to accept various culture, ethnic groups, identities and so on. Therefore, I believe that Japan should accept many types of marriage as a whole society."
9547,"I agree with your question. Religious problem is very touchy and big problem of the world. Sometimes religion help people, but sometimes religion kills people. Though it is complicated, we have to be understandable and open to religions."
9549,"It's true that we need much more time to produce all the energy in Japan by using renewable. However, it is possible to stop using nuclear power immediately. In fact, we could live without nuclear power for few years after Fukushima disaster. So it's untrue that we can only live comfortably by using nuclear power."
9550,I think the photo that has no moral should be banned. But there are many cultures in this world. And the values of moral is different among these cultures. So the world has many different morals. And we can use Facebook almost all over the world. So moral in Facebook is not one and it's very complex. So it's very difficult to choice what photo should be banned.
9552,"I think they don't need to prohibit the publication of such a photos. Actually, people have different feeling ,but it is free to post a photo as far as it is in a moral manner. Facebook should provide free field that we can exchange our opinion with everyone."
9555,"I think the picture of a fat woman mean freedom rather than unhealthy weight loss. Some people are fat, the other are thin and there are people who have black skin and gold hair in the world. Everyone is different and everyone is good. This behavior of Facebook violated human rights. I am sad because Facebook is spreading globally, but it did something like discrimination."
9556,"I agree with Duterte's idea that he kill criminals who are involved with illegal drugs because even if they are punished by law, the current situation will not improve. Proving hugely popular domestically shows that people in Philippines want capital punishment. It will be a throwback. I think everyone notices the seriousness of this problem."
9557,"I think we have to think another better ways too. However, we can take human rights away from criminals who are involved with illegal drugs because they killed many people. I cannot come up with a way to change the society more effectively than the death penalty."
9558,"I thought this Facebook's behavior is abuse of human rights. There are various kind of people in the world. Everyone is different, and everyone is special, discrimination should not be happen. We should take care about this."
9559,I think Facebook should have not banned photo of a plus-sized model. It is because Plus-sized is a kind of identity. Face Book do not have to consider about people's health and Plus-sized people have the responsibility of their own health. I think Facebook should be free space for all of the people.
9560,"I don't really mind as long as that person is wearing bikini or hiding the parts, but it is depend on the culture and the person. I know this is really complicated problem. but although, before they banned this woman or any other body-painted woman's picture, I want Facebook to ban pictures such as violence pictures and sexual and erotic videos."
9562,"To avoid to put some bloody or pornographic photos, Facebook should regulate some ads and personal photos. However it also could regulate traditional things. Each country has different culture, so it is really difficult to adapt the same guideline through Facebook."
9563,"I don't think the Facebook's ban is good because it seems to have discriminated against plus-sized people. I suppose a lot of people would feel unpleasant to Facebook through this news. Facebook has many users around the world, so of course it needs to make regulations. I wonder what is important is the rules are proper and they have clear standards. Also, it should be applied to all users equally."
9564,"I think the decision that ban the plus-sized picture was infringement of human right. In this case ,it was the infringement oh freedom of expression. Also, it showed the concept that slim people was better than plus-sized people. Of course, we have to change such trend."
9565,"It's understandable that Facebook ban inappropriate pictures. The pictures go viral in a short amount of time and everybody on Facebook can see those. To prevent younger aged users from seeing inappropriate pictures, Facebook definitely need to ban those. However whether the picture is inappropriate or not depends on the people's value. The solution to this problem would be having the users to set from where to where they think the picture is inappropriate before using Facebook."
9568,I am agree with the position of Facebook. Because the body image which is fat enough to injure the health has bad influence on the people who watch it.Of course some people say that Facebook abuse the fat people's feelings.However Facebook promote the users to have health lives through the exercise such as walking and running.I think it is nice action.Because there are many people died for life style disease in USA. Therefore I support the act of Facebook.
9569,"I agree with your opinion.Because the nuclear power is too risky to use.And nothing can take place safety.Additionally, I think Japanese government should not bring in the nuclear power and promote to use renewable resource more."
9570,"I think that Facebook should censor the commercial,but it should protect free of expression. There are many cultures in the world ,so we accept different idea and different culture. It should be stopped to catch a matter by one point of view."
9571,"I'm impressed by his attainment ,too. He is very brave man ,so I would like to be like him someday. In order to it, I continue to challenge the week area."
9572,"I think that is the difficult problem to be solved.That is because,what people think important is being various.In other words , what social media have to think is increasing too."
9573,"I agree with Facebook to ban those inappropriate pictures especially for children. There are lots of cultures in the world and each of us have different sense of values. Therefore, whether the picture is inappropriate or not depends on the people's sense of value. To solve this problem, Facebook should ask the users what kind of pictures are inappropriate for them before they start using Facebook."
9574,"Multinational companies such as Starbucks and Amazon have huge influence on the economic all over the world.If they are forced to pay too much tax,they will lose motivation.As a result,economic recession might arouse."
9575,"Of course,cruel or sexual photos should be banned.But it is very difficult to determine whether photos of fat women should be allowed or not.Some may think of them as unpleasant and others may not think so.I think Facebook is having difficulty determining it."
9576,"We need to think about what Facebook said more serious.This is because it shows how most people feel about not only such pictures but also real people. Everyone can choose whether to upload own pics or not, but before to do so, we should think again if that picture will make viewer feel bad."
9577,I agree with Facebook's stance. Facebook isn't government. So I think they don't have to be fair and we should respect their policy. But it is important to be fair too. It's difficult to keep balance of two.
9578,"I was so surprised hearing this news. This news might hurt people who are fat and want to wear bikinis. Facebook sometimes ban posts that include copyright violated music, and my friend's post was erased. I think it is necessary to ban the posts include something undesirable. However, Facebook should be more careful about banning posts."
9579,"After reading this story, I felt self-centeredness of the suspect. But I think the government also should have responsibility to this incident because it generates the unfavorable situation for the socially disadvantaged. As for the death penalty, I disagree to it. I have two reasons. First, if the judgement is mistaken, the death penalty will be irreparable loss. Our lives should be paid a great regard even if he or she commit a crime. Second, this penalty is so cruel that it is contrary to Japanese Constitution. To give psychological and physical pain to a prisoner is banned in the constitution. We have to find out an alternative plan for the death penalty."
9580,"For my opinion , banning a photo of a plus-sized woman , to some extent , is kind of a discrimination about plus-sized women. Definitely , this is unfair , unequal. I think Facebook should apologize to Tess Holliday."
9581,"I think SNS,for example twitter and Facebook shouldn't prohibit their users posting pictures for the reason of moral problems which are different between cultures. In these SNS,users can choose variation of posts they want to which. So Facebook should not regulate thought freedom of speech."
9582,"In my opinion, it is important to regulate some kind of photos which make people uncomfortable. At the same time, it is also difficult because banning them might lead to violate freedom of expression. We should pay attention to such a delicate problem."
9583,"I think that it is difficult to solve this problem as the values ​​are different for each person.People all over the world see the Facebook, so I think it is important to think about the opinion of the majority preferentially.It is because we can not draw any conclusive conclusions."
9585,"I think Facebook should not ban plus sized model . Because the picture of plus sized model was promoting body positivity . And fat body is feature , so it should not be banned ."
9586,i read this news. i was surprised. because i do not think the Facebook do such a discrimination. i think they should ban the grotesque photos. no discrimination must be existed.
9587,"I think they should not prohibit the publication of these photos. There are a lot of cultures in the world, so we think differently. Facebook provides us with opportunities that we all have to convey our thoughts. So we can exchange our opinions with anyone on Facebook."
9588,"To be honest, I was so surprised to know the news that Facebook banned the photo of a plus-sized woman Tess Holliday, since I knew that she was very famous and popular among many people. I think we should respect any kind of figure."
9589,"I think Facebook shouldn't have banned the picture of plus-sized woman. Because that action can be regarded as an insult and deprive her human rights. Moreover, censoring media excessively and strictly may lead deprivation of freedom of expression, which is avoided in today's society."
9590,"I think that sexual photos or grotesque photos should definitely been banned because those photos may make an unpleasant thought but it is not necessary prohibit a photo of a plus-sized because it is unfair to distinguish. Everyone is the only presence and has characters.So,this time,the behavior of Facebook is not very good."
9591,"In my opinion, Facebook should not ban their users posting photos of plus-sized women. If some users think these posts are unpleasant, they can just ignore those posts. As a global SNS, there are many people with different culture in Facebook. Thus, Facebook should forgive these posts and stop banning those posts."
9592,"I think that Facebook shouldn't have banned plus -sized woman because this action might deprive her of human rights. Of course, it is important to regulate inadequate photos such as violence. However, to be plus-sized is one of their identities so we should not say negative things about that."
9593,"I think the question treated in this article is ridiculous because people's lives are equal. Certainly,lawyers have to try such a question,which we don't have correct answer about."
9594,"I firmly think that there are many ways of using photos to convey messages. So, Facebook should have thought more carefully not to deprive her rights. However, some people might feel bad when they look at the photo of plus-sized woman shown on the SNS. We have to think this issue from both sides and try to make the best compromise."
9595,"Good point. I also think SNS is an influential and powerful source towards human. So, using these kinds of photo might not be a great choice. On the contrary, what should we do with the rights of the woman? I know it is controversial issue..."
9596,I think opinion that Cherchez la Femme claim is not wrong but Facebook's first decision is also right. To admit running ads of plus-sized model makes it feel bad who doesn't like fat body. We should think about the problem deliberately.
9597,I think that this act of Facebook is very very bad. This way to think of them is discrimination. This is same as the discrimination against black and women. We should have more strict line of sight to these acts.
9598,"The article of this time was the most difficult content in the article dealt with so far. What people think is different for each person. That is obvious, however, when it comes to posting on SNS, it is said that unspecified number of people will browse without posting it. SNS is a place where you can freely send your own experiences and thoughts, but I think that you need to use it with a firm understanding of the nature of SNS. Based on the above, I think that we should not touch much on sexuality in people on Facebook, even if it is male."
9601,"I think people shouldn't do anything which restricts a person's freedom because basically a human should live freely. However, some of the posts which include a content that leads to commit a crime should strictly be limited. That is because it might be taken others' freedom. Therefore, I consider that it is important for people to think carefully whether the post would give a bad influence or not before it gets limited."
9602,"I think anyone have attractive points for each. I often hear 'He is fat.' or 'She is not cute.' , but it is just from the speakers' senses. If other person see them, they might they have nice looks. So we don't have to care that kind of words and society should accept diversity."
9603,"Banning to post some kind of photos sometimes means that Facebook discriminates people, or looks down on culture. So I think Facebook should give people freedom to post any photos. Also, they should add new function which help people who don't want to see any sexual or violating photos ignore them."
9604,"I watch this news on TV every day in these days. There may be pressure of the Prime Minister's office. If it is true, it's a big scandal that involve in his future as a politician. However, he has accountability about this scandal. He should fulfill this duty earlier than a problem of the advance or retirement."
9606,"We should regulate some photos that make people uncomfortable. However, I think what Facebook did crosses the line. Even though it was not stated clearly, Facebook did imply that ' Being fat is undesirable '. However, everyone is allowed to determine what their ideal lifestyles are. In short, we have the harm principle, and being plus-size is one of them. Moreover, banning particular pictures on Facebook would result in unintended discriminations."
9607,"I have known this news because It's reported on a television and a newspaper. I think that using country budget for individuals is wrong. Prime Minister Abe is one of the great prime ministers, so I want him to do solid duties. Also, I do not want him to lose the credibility of the people any more. I hope he overcome this problem recently."
9608,"When I heard this news, I think it is like a TV drama. My one of favorite dramas' theme is similar this scandal. So I was surprised that such a scandal like a drama is occurred in the real. And, I think this scandal is not good because it's not fair. I think the top of country should do things under justice."
9609,"Recently, I'm often listened this news because this news attracts big attention all over the world. U.S. government and the its president have leaded world since the Second World War. So he should be a fugleman. It will need for us to check the truth and to decide how we judge him."
9610,"Since I do not have TV, I had never heard of the news. After I read the article, I thought this scandal might be a serious damage for Abe administration. Though Prime Minister Abe and Suga have strenuously denied any improper political intervention, the image of the administration was surely worsen. I hope every politician never lies to the people and media report only truth."
9611,"I have never been to foreign countries ,too,so I don't know foreign countries' rules. I would like to remember this rule when I can go abroad. If a foreigner got lost in Japanese rules, I would like to help."
9612,"I watch this news almost every day. However,the affairs of this news is so complicated that I can not understand this news well. And, I think there are many people who are like me. TV program has to make the contents easier."
9613,"Recently, there are a lot of problems of politician and money like this article. They are serious problem because our taxes will be included these money. However, I think that there are more important problem than them. For example, there are problem of national defense, declining birth rate and global warming. I want government to reflect more important problem."
9618,"In modern society, the young is said that they have not enough sleep. I think that is true.May be, the reason of this is heavy pressure that force us to study for our QOL is decided by our career. Considering of this, the young can't sleep enough, so we have to consider how we can sleep enough."
9619,"Thank you for your reply. I really understand that we cannot live without electricity. However, though almost all of the nuclear power plants in Japan stopped running after Tohoku earthquake, we can live without any inconvenience. From this fact, we can see that it is possible to ensure enough electricity to live without using nuclear power. Considering that nuclear power is so dangerous that it has possibility to kill people, I believe that we should abandon nuclear power immediately in Japan."
9620,"I really think that in these days the young seems to have less kanji skill than the elderly. Of course spread of PCs or smartphones is one of the causes of this trend, but I think lack of opportunity to read books or newspapers also has something to do with it. I was painfully aware of my lack of kanji skill when I took the Kanji Aptitude Test last year."
9621,"I heard about this accident on the news and I still remember I have been greatly shocked. I feel grain of sympathy for his feeling that he would like to be saved as soon as possible, but he should have fulfilled his duties or obligations as captain. In this accident, many young people including high school students have died. If I was in their position, I would be furious to his careless attitude."
9622,"Prime minister can easily lose his support from people or leadership by these scandals. Not only that, prime minister's bad scandals also relates to Japan's reputations and credit. I don't know the truth of this scandals but he should have more responsibility for his position."
9623,"Several problems have begun to emerge around Prime Minister Abe.He is gradually losing his support.He may not be able to do what he thinks is the most important,revise the constitution.But I think he should revise the constitution.So I want him to continue to be the Prime Minister."
9624,I think so too. His posture of continuing climbing with no age as an excuse is very great. Also I was encouraged to work hard no matter how old I am by him.
9625,"I think , in democratic country , like Japan , such scandals like these should not had happened. Because it contravene the tend of democracy. Indeed, corruption still shows in democratic countries, government should do something to control it .Also , citizens have accountability to supervise government staff."
9626,"I had known this news because it had been reported on TV. I had been thinking that Prime minister Abe was a good leader, so I was surprised to hear this. Using country budget for individuals is very wrong and he seems to give a vague reply. So I think Abe should explain it in detail to everyone"
9627,"I watch this scandals every day and knew that had influenced Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election.Abe administration should have had to make accountability and because of distrust ,Liberal Democratic Party had suffered a crushing defeat the election."
9628,"I think this is serious issue that we should focus on it carefully. Abe cabinet are trying not to explain the truth, if you ask me, they are hiding something to the citizens. This is not HEALTHY politics and Japanese have the right to know what is going on. We should be careful about this topic in order to keep our democracy."
9629,"I think government's excessive intervening to the problems of his close relationship including friends or family should be amended. Many people seem to feel discomfort about such government's actions, which was revealed in the results of Tokyo Assembly Elections conducted few days ago."
9630,"I read about this everyday in the newspaper, so I was familiar with it. I don't know whether the Abe administration used their power for this problem, but I think they should change their attitude. If not, we can't believe whatever they say and do for Japan."
9633,"Everyday I read this news on the internet and television. Prime minister Abe is the top of the administration so I think Abe must not do something wrong. We have to deeply think about more important problems than these problems, for example, North Korea, U.S. Forces Japan, and so on. So we should not think about prime minister's problems. Whether these problems are true or not, I think Abe should resign his post as soon as possible."
9635,"This issue is controversial in Japan, so I have known this entire story. I think that Mr. Abe should have responsibility for his utterance and action. In fact, more and more people came not to support Abe administration. Mr. Abe immediately have to get reliance of people in Japan again."
9636,"I think national flag reflect it's history and culture, too. There are flag which contain only the past history. It can be controversial problem in such country. On the other hand, in Japan, the flag 'hinomaru' continue to be used without a problem in particular. I found that national flag stand for feelings of the people in the country."
9637,"I think it's good do the campaign line this and promote the idea of same sex people. Nowadays many countries admit the same sex marriage compare to before and more people agree about it. But I think there can be the people who disagree about it , too. Of course it is bad that those people who disagree assault or hurt the LGBT people, but in some religion it is not allowed. I think that everyone should be free minded and admit that there are those LGBT people , and at the same time we need to realize that everyone have their thought including who doesn't agree. We also should not think that disagree is. As thing."
9638,"I think it's good do the campaign like this and promote the idea of same sex people. Nowadays many countries admit the same sex marriage compare to before and more people agree about it. But I think there can be the people who disagree about it , too. Of course it is bad that those people who disagree assault or hurt the LGBT people, but in some religion it is not allowed. I think that everyone should be free minded and admit that there are those LGBT people , and at the same time we need to realize that everyone have their thought including who doesn't agree. We also should not think that disagree is bad thing."
9639,"Keeping challenging in his age is really hard thing in both physically and mentally. I think that he could do this because he loves climbing the mountain very much. In the future when I get old, I also want to keep doing what I really love."
9640,"Even if you have any type of body, raising your own photos on Facebook or other SNS is an individual's right and I think that it is not something to be criticized. Everyone is different and everyone is okay."
9641,"I did not attention that there is no relationship to their own to deal with in the classroom about this article. However, knowing the contents left doubts. Is it bad even if there is a document? It seems like I lost sight of the essence of the problem"
9642,I hear about this news almost everyday on television. I know this is big issue but I feel media worked up too much. This kind of issue that involve family and friends occurs to many politicians so I think media should focus on more important issues that actually rely on general citizen.
9643,"I think Facebook should regulate some photos that discriminate people or make people feel uncomfortable, however Facebook is social network service and I think social net work should be the place that people can easily share their feeling or opinions so it is not good to regulate too much."
9644,"I have already known this political problems on TV. However I didn't understand what the news meant to. Additionally, any of my friends were not interested in the news. Moreover, it is said that Japanese young generations are not interested in politics. Therefore I think that we have to more know how to government carry out the politics. Because all Japanese have the right and the duty to check what the government do."
9645,"I've read articles about this in the newspaper and also on the TV, these news have been broadcast. So, I've known it. But, I'm not sure that the Abe administration used their power for this or not, but I think they should change their attitude toward people. They have to be conscious of it, if they want to maintain."
9646,"Facebook is one of the most popular (SNS)social net working systems in the world. Therefore, they have to respect human rights and should promote diversity in the world.But they didn't. Of course,there are some problems. Do they have to r protect and promote rights to convey everything even including violence,terrorism and so on. I think that not only SNS companies but also we have to consider."
9648,"Prime minister Abe should have more responsibility as a leader of Japan. Not only him, other politicians should have it too. Recently there are too many scandals like this. If they have enough time to cause scandals, I want politicians to spare their time to more important problems. Such as reconstruction from disaster, energy problem, self defense, and recession."
9649,I agree with you. It's very difficult to solve this problem by adapting the same guideline. Because it may ignore or discriminate some cultures. Facebook should have more careful discussion.
9650,"This is difficult for me to think even if I were a New Zealander, because Japan had never been colonized by other countries. However, I think New Zealand can change their national flags to be proud of themselves as New Zealanders."
9651,I think that banning plus sized model is discrimination. Facebook should give people freedom to post any photos but they should censor photos of porno or grotesque
9652,There are a lot of scandals of politicians.It takes many time and they cannot concentrate on politics. So I want them to be sincere.
9656,"I agree with your opinions. His reputation is going down and down and these school scandals influenced Tokyo assembly election. He lose it badly. I think many television company stopped investigating those, although we don't know the truth. Hope it will be figured out someday."
9657,"Yes, the top of country should behave under justice. And we care scandal too much. I think we should take care about other problems and choose appropriate the prime minister when we vote."
9661,"Although Abe is denying any improper political intervention, there is no smoke without fire. He is responsible for making everything clear and he should be sincere to us."
9662,I don't think that we can protect nuclear reactors. The Great East Japan Earthquake has demonstrated that technologies are no longer reliable in front of the threat of natural disasters. We should shift from using the nuclear energy to the renewable one.
9663,"Politicians search scandal each other. It's just useless. I think if there are much time to search scandal each other, politicians should work political problems."
9664,"I agree with your idea. Although the nuclear power seems attractive in terms of economics, we should not repeat the disaster happened in 2011. What we need to do is learn from the disaster and consider the safety of the environment seriously."
9667,"As many people says, I also think the best way is to saving both. Anyway,I think this exam is inappropriate as the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass.In this exam there is also sexual discrimination,moreover I believe the nation should not give certain value to every legal profession."
9668,"I agree with your idea. It is not only the right, but also the duty for us to check and monitor what the government is doing. However, as you said, not many people pay attentions to politics. Maybe our negligence of duty is causing these kinds of improper political interventions."
9669,"'Now, billionaires hoard cultural heritage, too. For all art lovers who don't belong to the richest 1 percent, even a museum pass can be pricey. ' I think this is a symbol as economic disparity in the world.Of course,everyone has right to decide how to spend own money.However, we face the serious differential,so we have to correct it in order to maintain Democracy."
9670,"When I read this article for the first time, I think the technology of self-driving cars is amazing and useful.However,things always have both a good and bad side.For example,employment of drivers will be able to be replaced by the technology of self-driving.But,I believe that we cannot go against the direction,so some helps or aids for unemployment of them will be needed."
9671,"I did not know this news before I read ,so when I read this article I was so surprised and,to tell the truth, I couldn't understand this article fully for the first time.After my finding the pints of this news,I come up to one thing. If we admit such a thing only in a specific group,other groups hope the same thing or they will be furious.So,I think apologizing is one of ways to make the situation settle down."
9672,"When I read this article, I was disappointed. Japanese society still permits human rights to be ignored and people don't care of it,even it directly relates to them. We should make some laws to protect refugees as the duty of world's citizen.I think Japanese government is responsible for this accident.Moreover,we,each persons have to be conscious of human rights."
9673,"i learned about him in my area study class in high school. I remember some of his quotes such as 'it always seems impossible until its done' , 'Real leaders must be ready to sacrifice all for the freedom of their people.' and so on. He has done lots of works for his people. R.I.P."
9674,"these day i think there are quite lots people who are too sensitive about others. i mean i think playing outside during childhood is really important. there are many things that we only can do at outside. and i guess these kids are not playing outside at late. people should not avoid these chances, and probably who are saying these complaints were also playing outside when they were young. i hope they will be much kind to others."
9675,I'm also glad that Japanese cuisine gets UNESCO heritage status. I love Japanese food and I hope many foreigners to try it. it is healthy and tasty. also if Japanese food become famous it will help our economics by selling those food or building Japanese restaurant in foreign countries.
9676,"I was surprised about this news. i have never thought about changing national flags. i cant really think of any merits by changing it either. i also like the design of national flag of New Zealand, so i don't think they have to change it. although if they can be more proud of their flag or their nationality by changing flag, that would be good for them."
9678,"I think what the politician is recently doing is just pointless. They are not doing what they should be working on and arguing about the scandals. Of course Mr.Abe must make it clear about what he has actually done, but the opposition party should do something else rather than just attacking Mr.Abe on the scandal."
9679,In fact I don't really like kids screaming outside. But it just can't be helped. I understand that they need to play outside. The neighbors better be more patient and go easy on the children.
9683,"This is a terrible news.The captain has an obligation to prioritize the safety of passengers, neglecting it is a very bad thing.I was shocked.I do not want such a tragedy to be repeated."
9686,I was very surprised that the design of the flag can be changed.I feel that this is a characteristic of a country with international problems such as colonies.It's news that Japanese people are not familiar with.
9687,I think that this case is not acceptable.Paintings are very valuable and attract a lot of people.Many people was shocked because the picture had been destroyed.I hope that such an accident never happens again.
9688,"I take it for granted that more and more people show rising rates of disapproval of the Abe cabinet and the prime minister himself, because he doesn't reveal details of these cases. We cannot trust what he said without evidences. Furthermore, it isn't said much since the Abe cabinet is launched in 2012, the prime minister of Japan is changing too much. It is hard to get back trust."
9689,I agree with your opinions. I voted for the city council election for the first time. Japan is faced with the problem that young people doesn't vote very much. I think it would be better to solve this as soon as possible.
9690,"i didn't know that those company have lost that much money. I can understand people rather choose listening music free not by paying money, but it is illegal. i wish this punishment will success. in my case i use apple music and its pretty good system."
9691,"I don't think he is a hero, but i also don't think he is bad man. i just couldn't believe that there are such a thing. it is like a movie. although by his action citizens had chance to think about their country's system and society. I think it good. but i am not sure that there are any big changes by his action in US."
9692,"i have a Brazilian friend and they said they think their government is not listening to citizens. they ignores people's live also government is corrupted. although i think the decision that government have done was a fine. but citizens are not thinking that way.that is a problem. i guess in Brazil, there are big gaps between citizens and government."
9693,"i am quite not sure about what Abenomics is. even though i heard it several times on the news. but in my experience i think the cost of houses are getting higher and higher. I am not sure it is really good for our economics but i think its getting better, so maybe prime minister Abe is doing good job about this. I can feel that he is trying to change Japan however its good or not."
9694,I'm not sure why North Korea has continued to launch rockets in spite of sharp criticism from Asian countries and USA. I think North Korea should act more cooperative.
9695,"I think people downloading pirates music a lot is really big problem. This article is published in 2012, and five years later, I think this problem became more serious. In recent, a number of people who has their own smartphone is definitely increasing, and people listen to the music by phone. We can easily download the illegal app and download and listen to the music. I suggest that we need a new law which is suitable for today."
9696,"I haven't understood the Nobel Peace Prize well,especially the standard of winning before I read this article.Now, I've gotten more problems by reading it. What is the point?-I'm not sure.But, I can say that without very clever way to cope with this matter, we are still at a loss."
9697,"In terms of equality, we have to take care about discrimination. If people are hurt when a photo is banned, we must not do action like this news. When we use SNS, we have to think that my article may be seen all over the world."
9698,I think so too. SNS should be equal to all people. We have other things to ban. It's so useless time. We must have an idea that SNS is located on complex situation.
9699,I agree with your opinion. This problem is so difficult to solve. Many people have each beliefs and these are different from others. It's so complex that we have to be careful when we use SNS.
9700,I agree with your opinion. We should not use nuclear power because many earthquakes can be caused in Japan. We must not have the idea that Japan is same condition with other countries. I think we should choose safety rather than convenience.
9701,I think so too. Nuclear power is too dangerous to treat in Japan. We have to change our opinions by 3.11. We have alternative powers and they are enough to live. Safety is the most important I think.
9702,"I agree with your idea. We should consider the problems from economic and environmental. But our top priority is safety of people, so we should put economic effect off."
9703,"I think so too. Though he is very old, he accomplished great his purpose. It's amazing. I want to be good challenger like him."
9704,"Me too. I was so surprised to hear this news. He kept challenging his limit, so he accomplished such a fantastic success. This story gave me a confidence. I want to keep challenging like him."
9705,I agree with you. He is so respected for me. I think he did a lot of efforts to be strong though he is 80 years old. So I thought young people have to do anything hard when we have much energy.
9706,"Yes, I think so too. We have grown up without religion. So we don't know about religious rules. Religious conflicts are caused all over the world. We have to know that religion is so important for foreigners."
9707,"I agree with you. We must study the country's rule when we go abroad. It is so important because religious rule is so big for foreign countries. If we broke the rule, we may be arrested. It's so scared."
9708,Aging society causes a lot of complicated problems. Lacking work people is typical one. I think it's effective to create environment that old people can work. The government should take some measures as soon as possible.
9709,"In my honest opinion, I want to have self-driving car in the near future. The technology is developing rapidly every day. So Google's trial is good. However, they may cause a lot of problems when they're introduced into society. It's necessary to consider whether they bring us better life."
9710,"I think Obama's re-election was good news to not only USA but also other countries. Now the president has changed,but he left great achievements to new history in USA. He was one of the best presidents,I think."
9711,"I felt disappointed after reading this article. It's embarrassing, but I didn't know the actual condition of refugee center. As Japan's slow reaction was criticized, it's not good for Japanese people to be indifferent to international news."
9712,"I agree with Obama's opinion. Thoughts and sense of value for marriage or gender are different for every one. I think it's identity ,so any decision will respected."
9713,"As this news,I think Abe is blind to the hope of people in Okinawa. They have been suffering from the army of USA. Needless to say , it's difficult to solve this problem soon, but I hope the situation will improve."
9714,"I was so moved to read this heartwarming news. She never gave up running during her hard race. Her achievement brought everyone around the world courage and impression. I want to be like her, who have strong mind."
9715,"I was disappointed to this crime against humanity. One man killed two person to suicide himself. I can't believe it. There is pros and cons, but in my opinion, I don't think death penalty should abolished. Because it may be a deterrent to some kind of crimes."
9716,"I really feel Japanese people have less opportunity to write. Even us, in the university, we use own computers instead of notebooks.Also, we send emails instead of letters. It's very useful, but we may have time to write by myself as before not to forget kanji."
9717,"No one can predict when the earthquakes will happen, so accusing seismologist's miss judging is not right decision. Even the technology will developed, it's impossible to predict natural disasters, I think."
9718,"I think this problem is too difficult to solve. Sony is one of the most popular companies in Japan, so I want to overcome and improve this hard situation. Foreign company like Apple is also popular in Japan, I use their phone,however, Japanese products are appreciated in their quality. I'm sure that Japanese company will be stronger in the world."
9719,"I was shocked to read this news. I think crime against humane should never happened again. The threat of terrorism has increased recently, measures like checking the belongings should strengthen when many people gather one place in the same time."
9720,"I think EU should not receive Nobel Peace Prize. Instead,the prize should be given to individuals who made efforts for EU peace. Actually, the difference between EU is becoming large. Also, EU has many serious problems around immigration. I think EU sometimes use power to treat them smoothly , it's not peaceful way."
9721,I heard this news a few weeks ago and I thought using budget for individual is very wrong . I think Abe should apologize to people in japan .
9722,I think they should not ban any individual's photos. People should be free to post any photos. Each people have different ideas and feeling .So Facebook should not ban any individual's photos posted.
9724,"I'm so sorry for these victims of this accident. It' s beyond my imagination that many people from Africa were heading for Europe in the same time for dear their lives. I know it's hard to improve the people life in Africa, but I hope the situation will gradually be better. Developed countries have to any supports not to increase refugees in Africa."
9725,"I know only good quality sleeping is important, but I didn't know the function of the brain for sleep. Recently we use mobile devices for long time every day. I think it influences to our brain, for example, preventing for sleep or making brain fatigue. Now I want to improve my sleep."
9726,"I think spying action totally violates individual right,however, it's needed to get information like terrorism as soon as possible. But, Bugging someone's phones or private talks must not be revealed to the world. Honestly, I think in this case, the all responsibility is for USA government."
9727,"It's very complicated problems. However, drone strike is inhumane action even if there are unfair reasons. I think every country should ban to use and produce weapons. However, of this policy is introduced,people will oppose, like controlling guns in USA. For they think guns as a way of protecting myself."
9728,"I was so disappointed to read this news. Scandals with politicians have constantly occurred recently. Like this case, using our tax for their own entertainment is ridiculous. We hope politicians take right actions as a public person."
9729,I think Mr.Yamada should have treated this nuclear problems more carefully.His decision is not proper as our representative. Japan cannot avoid the nuclear problems because we experienced the threat of them in the big earthquake in 2011. We ourself also think them more serious.
9730,"The function of sleep is very important. I about know it already. Today, some people work or study whole day without sleep because they are very busy. But I think we need sleep even if they begrudge spending their free time to sleep. We can clean our brain and fix memories by sleep. So I think we can memorize easier and work more efficiently with enough sleep."
9731,"It is TRUE that Japanese companies are not competitive today, but their products' quality is still high. Companies should make products match their customers' needs, and governments should support them with approving several pieces of legislation faster which help companies develop their products."
9732,"I disagree with the Abe's administration about the nuclear power. The nuclear power is too dangerous for both human and the nature. We are also in danger of missile from North Korea , so the nuclear power plants can be the target. I think it was really good thing that the installation of solar panel spread generally after the Fukushima disaster. I think the government should make it more spread and try to count on the general people more about the energy sources."
9733,I think that those social network service (SNS) companies like Facebook or Instagram or twitter should care more about those sensitive problem that can make the standards. Because many young people use them and they influence young's feeling or how those young behave a lot. I think that those SNS company should feel more responsible for their influences.
9734,I agree with you. This case seems to be a drama. It may not be possible to believe just by listening. I hope this problem will be solved fundamentally
9735,"I agree with you. However, there are many such discrimination in SNS. Each of these problems must be solved with consciousness. Recently there are cases where the school monitors student's SNS."
9736,"I was really familiar to these scandals. We can not know that it was true or not, but if it were true, I think Mr. Abe should be more responsible to his position, and apologize to people about these scandals. I believe scandals of politicians would be declined."
9737,I agree with you that there are many elderly people who are energetic in Japan. I suppose going to many countries and make new friends when you became 80 is really good idea.
9738,"I agree with you. In Japan, most people have a stereotype about the same sex marriage. I think it is good idea to remove such prejudice by setting up 'gay and straight' traffic lights."
9739,I think so too. We should study and try to know the culture of other country. We should not be so closed.
9740,"I thought your comment was very wonderful. It is very difficult to challenge your limits, but I am excited to see someone who is challenging regardless of age I hope that Imoto will become such a person as well."
9741,"I think it is so difficult problem, too. It depends on culture or religion to judge 'what is violence'. If everyone feel bad about that picture, Facebook can ban it."
9742,"I agree with your opinion. It is actually a big scandal, but the press should also report other issues as well."
9743,"Each country has its own characteristics and each rule is there. people in other countries can not think about it When traveling abroad, you must be careful when going to a country where religion is deeply rooted in the country"
9744,"I agree with your opinion. It is true that Abe has 'strong leadership' than predecessors. However, I believe that the true leadership includes the ability to make comprehensible explanations."
9745,"Of course spying is bad thing for any reason, but I think NSA will not stop it. Also, I think that the information which they get through spying will be used not only to save countries from terrorism, but also for business in the future."
9746,"The Abe administration has to check its attitude toward governing. Now that it has a lot of problems not only the Moritomo Gakuen and Kake Gakuen scandals but also inappropriate remarks which were made by some ministers, many Japanese feel a mounting anxiety about the Abe administration's politics. It should make an effort to regain people's trust because Japan is a democratic country."
9747,"Partly, I agree with you. It is true that the Abe administration betrayed people's trust. Also, it is right that it has to apologize immediately. However, I think that many Japanese people and TV shows miss the important point. We forget that we chose the Abe's Liberal Democratic Party. It has the great responsibility towards us, but we also have the responsibility that we chose them. If some people think that the Abe administration is really bad, what they have to do is not only to blame them but also regret their choice."
9748,"In Tokyo assembly elections, Liberal Democratic Party lost a lot of seats. It showed national anxiety to the Abe administration. I think Abe should make efforts to get trust."
9749,"In this article,Trump said the government should block for Muslims to enter the United States. I disagree with him. A part of the majority of U.S.(like WASP) support his idea,but I think that is not reasonable way.They are also immigrants or descendants of them,so they probably don't have the right to reject immigrants' entering. Moreover,I think his idea is too selfish to be one of the world's reader. All people may have fear for terrorism and they certainly do not want to be victims of terrorisms.So, we all persons have to unite to overcome this terrible situation."
9750,I also want Facebook to treat any personality as important and equal. I hope that undesirable happenings like this news will never occur.
9751,I was also encouraged by him. I want to try many things and to stop setting limits on anything.
9752,"I am firmly support that 'the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter.' All people have to respect the election because it is one of the most important thing in democracy.So,I think candidates should wear 'appropriate ' clothes because if they do not wear clothes,which is suitable for the election, people cannot trust him or her and the importance of it will be decreasing."
9753,I agree with you. Japanese people need to think about problems of sexual minorities more seriously.
9754,"I was surprised to read this news. I didn't know the flag design can change by vote. I think the flag symbolizes the country itself, so the native people have the rights to decide."
9755,It 's surprising for me that Picasso's masterpiece is so expensive. It's beyond my imagination. I don't know why people pay much money for Picasso's masterpiece. I think it's because i don't know how Picasso is great painter.
9756,We need to understand taboos of each religion. I will learn more about various manners and taboos in order not to make someone feel unpleasant.
9757,"I was very surprised to this news. Using the drugs is ridiculous, but, his action is too inhumane. I think there is another way to deal with this problem. He is supported by many people, however, I think his action is too radical."
9758,"I had thought multinational companies paid much more tax than sausage stands. Such big companies make influences to economic side. Recently, it's not in good condition of world economic, so they should hep with improving this situation."
9759,I was very sad when I first heard the news. Shinzo Abe is a symbol of our country. I want him to change his mind.We cannot trust what he said without evidences.I want him to keep up because I support him.
9761,"I think the system of Amazon Go is epoch-making, because it is very convenience and saves our times to buy. I heard the news that even older people use these services. I felt the trend of the times."
9762,I am agree with your idea. Facebook shouldn't have banned the picture of plus sized picture. All the people in the world have equal right. I think SNS will be comfortable for every one.
9763,I think Face book should change their mind. It was sad when someone's photo was banned. SNS is necessary for us now so it is a good chance to review what is Internet.
9764,"As your opinion, I think we must not ignore the problem of money. It should not be allowed to use money in a inadequate way because the money is collected from part of our life. Even though the rumor which Abe overuse the money is not true, the reliance of people in japan and the top in foreign country will decline. Therefore, the government should not do like this fault."
9765,"He is a great man because it is very hard to climb such a big mountain. To achieve this deed, he must have to do a lot of things including some severe training and exercise. I'm not sure how hard his training is, I guess he trained a lot. I want to be like him, so I will try to do my best."
9767,I agree with you. This news made me think how SNS should be in the Internet society. It will be our task forever.
9768,"Your attempt is very good. I think that I would like to be like him, too. We should use our time challenging."
9769,"I agree with you. We chose members of an assembly by the election, so we have the responsibility to monitor them and have to check they achieve their duty. We should keep our democratic system by our own efforts."
9770,"I agree with your opinion. I suppose that Facebook has many users all over the world, so should regulate in a certain level. However, the regulations like this case should not be allowed because it might be discrimination and abuse."
9772,"Thank you for having replied to my comment.I agree with your opinion . Japanese is owner of Japan, so ,to some extent ,keeping Japanese democratic system is Japanese obligation."
9773,"I almost agree with you. People's reliance is necessary for Mr Abe. However, I wonder Japanese people can understand politics and other Japan problem. Then, I think that government should consider more important thing like national defense."
9774,"I disagree with you in part. I think the problem of government's using money should be focused on because the money includes our taxes. Of course, other problems is very important, but this problem is as important as them."
9775,"I agree with you. There are a lot of cultures in the world, so it is difficult to regulate Facebook in the same way. We should cope with these problems flexibly."
9776,"Thank you for having replied my comment.I champion your idea.Recently the Abe administration has done some remarks, which against the democratic spirits and caused the decline of support rate. I think this reflects most Japanese anxiety."
9777,I think so. The thing that he managed to do is very great. I want to live up to his example in the future.
9778,I also think so. She gave us a strong power. I look up to someone who can encourage other people through his or her action.
9779,"This article was so shocking. Government should change their policy to new one which can improve this bad condition. But it's very difficult task, because we have to not only care elderly people but should not forget to care children and young generation."
9780,"I agree with you. This idea is very nice, but I think if we in Japan adopt these signals, a lot of people oppose it. It is important to make them understand gay people."
9781,I think so too. The government should make work environment better by changing their policy.
9783,I agree with you. Plus sized is one of the identifies. We should admit various style of identifies.
9784,I agree with you. Plus sized is one of the identifies. We should admit various style of identifies
9785,"Recently, there are many political problems. I think politicians have to be trusted, so they should tackle their work more seriously. I wonder if they cause problems, they should apologize and explain the truth."
9786,"I want to find something challenging in my life too. Climbing mountain is very hard, however I jealous that he found something lay his life on the line."
9787,I read this article and I remembered that at that time.I was worried that this music was downloaded automatically.Some people dislike it when music that you do not want to listen is being downloaded.I am happy that it is a system that you can optionally download.
9788,I have heard about these two scandals. I have also watched a few TV programs about these scandals. Abe's support from people is getting weaker and weaker. It can be known from the losing seats of the Liberal Democratic Party in Tokyo parliamentary elections.
9789,"I also think so. Politicians should discuss issues about tax, working, and so on instead of political scandals."
9790,"I am surprised too. Also, I like the idea like such a traffic lights. Because it is unique and make our feelings happy. In Japan, I want see this."
9791,"I cannot agree with you in part. These issues in other countries are not unusual. What did those leaders do? They resigned soon. Does only Abe's administration can resolve the problem of national defense, declining birth rate or global warming? I think the answer is No. Maybe we can try something new."
9792,"I was literally moved with her story. She didn't give up, and also she work to help other paralyzed people. I'd like everyone to know that there are wonderful and brave people like her."
9794,I think so too. We should find our goals and try to accomplish it so that we could be like Mr. Miura.
9795,"I hope so too. I think that Japanese companies will be able to play an active role in these field, medical technology. I want many people to live their lives happily with future technology."
9796,"I hope so too. People in Japan have to be more acceptable for the same sex marriage. I believe that someday, we can install the new traffic lights idea."
9797,"thank you for replying. I think we should keep rule of the country's majority religion when we go to foreign countries.As you say, we could not keep all rules and customs of other religions. But If we were ignorance, we could arrest in the same way as British woman in Sri Lanka. So I think we should keep rule of the country's majority religion ."
9798,"People usually make themselves look like they care about the rights of the minorities. However, they never think about the consequence to the majorities."
9799,"I agree with your idea that it would be helpful to understanding about LGBT to set up the new traffic light in the big city. There are many people from many countries and different religions in the big city, so there would be the best place to start."
9800,I agree with your opinion. Being plus-sized is only one of the identifies. It is not good or wrong just like being slim is.
9802,"I agree. We have to respect other culture each other, and not deny them. We should learn and try to know about different cultures."
9803,"I think the current working environment in Japan is not good.Such a society is the best, as it is sought for help when it gets really hard.I think that we should seek ways to reduce mental damage."
9804,"I feel that while Prime Minister Abe emphasizes what is convenient, he always cheats that unfavorable things happen to him. Especially I would like you to reconsider that the money are coming out of the taxes paid by citizens and honestly answer without hiding secretly."
9805,"Thank you for replying. I think we, living civil society people, should change the mind for LGBT people. No matter how government call, it is meaningless not to change consciousness of the people. So I think , to change consciousness of the people, government should more call and NPO should more take action is very important."
9807,"I think it is exactly the same. If he is really thinking of the people, he should talk honestly. Otherwise he will lose your faith as this person says, and eventually his position will be robbed."
9808,"I agree with Facebook's stance. Because Facebook is one company, I think they don't have to be fair and do their job according to the rules. Of course, to abuse specific person is prickly problem. However, because of Facebook is not government but private company, I think they are not bad."
9809,"As you have pointed out, we could live without inconvenience although nearly all of the nuclear power plants had stopped. Plus, media claim that Japan is generating enough electricity. On the contrary, it is high time we focus this issue from different perspective. For instance, if you look at it from the aspect of economy, there is a data that Japan have recorded a deficit by not depending on nuclear power. This is what media have not claimed on a mass scale and most Japanese probably don't know. Economic impact on Japan can lead to serious social breakdowns not only domestic but also internationally. I know that nuclear is not a BEST way of generating electricity. However, what are we going to do with radioactive wastes? We cannot keep them in a pool forever. Government have discussed about it however there is no such movement taken so far. I know it is a difficult problem that we definitely need to consider, but if you ask me, it is irresponsible to say 'we should abandon nuclear power immediately in Japan.' It was a great opportunity to think about this topic with you. I hope we could discuss it again sometime in the near future. Good night!"
9810,Learning different culture may be the shortest way to bring happiness. Thanks for you comment!
9811,"Influence of the Internet is large because it touches the eyes of various people at once. So we have to think carefully about that point. However, I think that freedom of speech and freedom of expression should be preserved on SNS. So I think that it is incorrect to ban the listing of only people of a certain system as described in this article."
9812,That is a great idea! We have to think about it more flexible to make people's mind change. Thanks for your comment!
9813,"We need to learn about other culture for more understanding. Thank you for you comment, sir."
9814,Good perspective. I think he need to work hard to recover his trust. Otherwise he will be compelled to resign the cabinet.
9815,I agree with you. I think politician need to discuss more about other issues rather than discussing this scandals at the committee.
9816,"I agree with this opinion. Although we know that we should not discriminate, we may make discriminatory remarks without knowing it. Also we think we should also be aware that such texts can be seen all over the world."
9817,"I've heard a lot about this news, because everyday I watched this news on TV. I think this scandal is a big disadvantage to Prime minister Abe , and this is very obvious from the result of Tokyo metropolitan assembly election. I strongly believe that politicians must be trusted.And we also have to think about the duty and the rights to know what the government does."
9818,"When I saw this news, I thought Facebook invaded human rights. The figure of the man shouldn't be criticized by others, so I think Facebook should change its attitude."
9819,"The problem of this news is that Facebook approve double standard. The definition of beauty and ugly is different from people to people. And this definition is also different from culture to culture. So we have to think more carefully about the definition of beauty , but personally I think we should not decide the definition of beauty. We must not judge people by their color of skin and their body proportion."
9820,"When I heard about this news ,I could just say 'Wow'. i just want to say his feat is really amazing because not only he is over 80 years old but also he is Japanese. It is often said that Japanese has disadvantages on physical. I proud of him so much as a same Japanese , and I really want to keep challenging everything like him ."
9821,"I think this is serious problem. In democracy, the prime minister should do job for all people in Japan, These Mr.Abe'action is not fare and should not be allowed. To keep democracy, we should be careful these political topic."
9822,"This woman was so unlucky that she was arrested in other country. The culture is different from culture to culture. While in some country Buddha tattoo is cool , in some countries it regarded as taboo. I can say this news comes down to this sentence, 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do.'"
9823,"I think so,too. However , his achievement is still worth because he was 80 years old. It is fact that while I worry for his body , I am existed to hear the new big news of his achievement."
9824,"There are too many problems around Abe administration. The problem that is not unusual to lose office until now happened, the administration take makeshift measures. Government should be under the nation in the first place. We should stare at Abe administration with hard eyes."
9825,I was also impressed by Miura's way of living that does not make limits. And I am proud that he updated the record. I also want to challenge various things without limiting like him.
9826,"I think this new system is really efficient,. But at the same time, I fear of the possibility that at the result of pursuing the efficiency , this new system would deprive many low-wage workers of their jobs. Personally I like this idea, by amazon go , I think we can lead more useful life by spending less time on shopping."
9827,Thank you for reply! I support your opinion. The most important thing is understanding them.
9828,"I was really surprised at the news that Trump won the election. Obama was admired by everyone but it is true that he was too ineffectual. So many of his supporters was tired of his policy ,therefore many people chose Trump ,because Trump was seen as active. But at the same time, I think the result of this election was natural judging from the history., after ineffectual president Carter , Reagan was chosen."
9829,"I feel the same way. I think Japanese people are pushing my feelings into my mind trying to arrange the appearance. That's why LGBT etc. are not well known, so it will result in discrimination as a result. So I think that it would be good if we could change people's awareness with such traffic lights."
9830,"I feel the same way. Various people come from each country in the Olympic Games, so that rules of various countries will collide with each other. I think it is necessary to take measures to prevent trouble."
9831,"I really admire his effort to eliminate drug crime. But at the same time , his effort has the possibility that it stimulates criminals. Probably he could eliminate crime by other ways . We can see how his effort worked by statistics , but what we have to know indeed is what is happening under surface."
9833,I think you have a nice idea. We can get geothermal energy anytime. Japan needs to develop renewable energy like geothermal more in order to use it efficiently.
9834,"I agree with you. Through his achievements, we can learn that it is important to continue to challenge difficulties. I really respect him."
9835,"I agree with you. We have the right and the duty to know what the government does. If it's not clear, we should pursue the truth."
9837,"Technology always makes our life easier, however if robots evolve more, we would control our life or jobs by the technological products. Using robots are effective for companies because it reduces personal labor costs. Also, consumer can get services or products in cheaper costs. But people should continue to work. I think people can consider more and treat some problems calmly at the emergency."
9839,"I think those scandals will not ruin the Abe's cabinet because even though people know Abe's cabinet is not really good, they think that he is at least better than anyone else. To ruin the Abe's cabinet, opposition parties should try to make us feel that we can leave them the government."
9840,"I agree with you. I watched the news on the TV but I could hardly understand it. Maybe if I watch the TV and listen to them carefully I will be able to understand , but I feel it's so stupid thing. I feel that these kind of scandals make people away from the politics."
9842,"I watched this news and I brushed up this information with internet information.By this information Vice Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology have a malice because the government gave him a sack because of his injustice.So he said that there was a document between prime minister Abe and Kake gakuen.But this story is complete fabrication,so prime minister Abe is a sufferer."
9843,"I think so, too. This Facebook behavior must have hurt some people's feelings. They should try not to hurt people's feelings. I can understand that the Facebook bans sexual or violet photos but I can't understand it bans unhealthy photos. The line between healthy or unhealthy is really faint, so they can leave it to each user."
9844,"Even the burkini reminds us Islam, and I know some French people feel fear about that, making women who wear burkini leave beach is unacceptable. Laws cannot ban or take rights from some specific religion. Recent terrorism threaten people but most of Muslims are not related to the terrorism. French government should separate religion and politics."
9845,"I think so too,I feel internet information is easier and more than TV information,so you have to take the information by internet!"
9846,"I think your opinion is too ideal. Making geothermal energy more useful will take so much time and we are not sure that how much we can make it useful. If we continue using nuclear power until then, the risk will still stick to us. I think we should think more about leaving electricity to general people."
9848,"I think this is a serious problem,because our body is not same from we were born to the Earth.So we don't have to hesitate to contribute on the SNS,and we mustn't find fault in it."
9849,I hear about this news every day on TV. If the scandal is true it is a big problem that he used country budget for individual. He has the responsibility to behave under justice since he is the top of a country.
9850,"I agree with you. I really like travel and eating and I would like to do them when I get old, too. I think that it will make us feel more easy not thinking about it as challenging rather doing what we love."
9851,"I agree with your opinion. In the world, there are a lot of culture and each person has a different thoughts. So it is very difficult to decide what the moral is."
9852,"I think so too,we have to make SNS easier to state one's opinion.And also social minorities should be brave,because if they could not state opinion,they will come back to the minor position."
9854,This problem is so controversial because it is related with money and taxes we pay. I was agreeing with Abe cabinet but this news makes me distrust his political behavior. This news also lessen the trust from the people who live in Japan. Mr. Abe should make efforts to restore public confidence.
9855,"Thank you for replying. Recently, there are so many foreign tourists in Japan. And we should know there religious rules and think about their religions. I think this is 'omotenashi' in Japanese."
9856,"I agree with one of your idea that we need to use renewable energies, but if we banned the use of nuclear energy we will fall into the power shortage. So my opinion is to less the use of nuclear energy and increase the use of renewable energy sources."
9857,I think so too. I was very surprised that 80-years man succeeded to climb the top of Mt.Everest and this success needs a lot of efforts. I want to emulate this man.
9858,"I think so, too. Not harming anyone nor being pushy are really important thing. It's good to be accepted the idea naturally. I think we can apply this way in many area."
9859,"I agree with your opinion. In the world, there are a lot of people and has different views so we do not need to agree with the majorities all the time."
9861,Me neither. I don't know about the different culture and thoughts so I think I need to speed my knowledge when I go to foreign countries or to communicate with the foreign people.
9862,"Culture difference sometimes complicated problem, but we have no other choice but to understand each other and be careful not to make other people feel bad."
9863,"Nuclear power is very risky. So, Japan will have to change the way we create the power. But, soon we can't rely on generation completely. I think we have no choice but to consider the way and amount of nuclear until we can use the new power power generation efficiently."
9864,"I think so too. Many of Japanese people think that there're not so many same sex couples in Japan, the topic is hot just in foreign countries. Sexual minorities in Japan may feel difficult to live."
9865,"I think so, too. Like you do, I think that the feeling caring about the local people is very important. Because even if we don't really know about them, that having those feeling help us not hurting the local people's feelings."
9867,Thank you for a reply.We have to carry out our duty to check what Japanese government do.And the young generation just should more interested the politics.
9868,I agree with you. Everyone should treat equally with birth.
9869,Thank you for a reply.I vote for the city council election too.I think we have to carry out our duty to choose the appropriate leaders.And it will make this country better.
9870,I think Prime Minister Shinzo Abe should be responsible for his actions. The prime minister is the representative of Japan. If there is no trust no one will miss.
9871,"I would doubt that these traffic lights will not be accepted in Japan. It's true that most Japanese people are not really used to the LGBT idea as a reality thing, but among the young people or in the city I think it's more accepted. So the unique idea can be tried in Japan also. I hope that LGBT idea is more accepted in Japan."
9872,"I think so too. Too much tax may discourage big companies to avoid expanding their business in the country. But we need tax revenue from companies, so it's difficult to have best solution."
9873,"I agree with you. Before I read this article, I was not interested in the idea of same-sex couples. As you said, we often see traffic lights in our daily lives, so it is easy for us to be familiar with this idea by using these traffic lights."
9874,"I think so. The life seems long, but is really short. We hope to challenge something new in my life."
9875,"I think nuclear energy is very powerful. However, the risk is also big, so I think that you should never misuse it."
9876,I agree with you that we shouldn't decide our limit by our age. What Mr.miura did told us we can do anything and encouraged us. We can have more free minded and we shouldn't bind ourselves not only by our age but also by the gender or character or environment.
9877,"Me too. There are no popular resources such as petroleum in Japan, but there are abundant natural resources. Therefore, I think that we should make use of natural energy more."
9878,"I agree partly with you. This is a good way for us to be familiar with the same-sex marriage. However, this traffic lights seem to be little bit provocative for Japanese. There must be some intense controversies. We have to be careful to introduce this kind of traffic lights."
9879,"I think so too. Without being safety, we can't living even though energy is cheap. So I think safety is more important than cheapness."
9880,I have read that there are usually national nature parks around the volcanoes and if we make the geothermal energy plants there those nature will be destructed. I think we should see both the merits and the demerits.
9881,"I think that it is a very good attitude. Regardless of age, Mount Everest thinks that it is not easy to climb. I also learned a lot from this article. Do not compromise."
9882,I completely agree with you. Everyone is not same and everyone owns right each. These rights should be protected and the world that everyone can behave as they are should be real.
9883,I respect Mr. Miura that I can continue to challenge the limit despite being so aged very much. I also want to become a mentally strong person too.
9884,"When we meet LGBT people, we maybe feel ' we should treat them equally.' Then we segregate us from them. These people is not special but natural. It is important for such idea to spread. The approach has utility for this. The next generation will take the idea there is various couple in world for granted."
9885,I agree with you. It is so difficult for Japanese to understand religious belief. We have to provide our culture like 'Everything have the heart' and understand other religion and culture.
9886,"It is very interesting comment. For sure, everyone feel more exciting if there is such lights."
9887,I agree with that we have to change the trend that slim people are better than plus -sized people. I think the changing is also becoming a trend. I have seen the news that too skinny fashion model is banned in France because it will encourage the slim is good thought and influence badly on especially young people. But there are still these thought in people's mind. It seems really hard to change it.
9889,"I agree with you. Now, in Japan, there are a lot of political parties which try to come to power, but they don't have enough ability to support Japan. The Abe administration isn't the best but it is better than any other authorities."
9890,"I agree with you. Those kind of scandals may help opposite parties to ruin the ruling party and get the administration, although at the same time it encourages people to feel exhausted about the politics and loose interests in politics. I also feel really tired of those topic. I want government to treat more important topics."
9891,"I agree with you. I think this attempt 'gay and straight' is very interesting idea. Now, same-sex couples are not accepted as well by general people in Japan. Therefore, we should learn various system from other countries that have greater system than Japan."
9892,"I cannot agree completely. This story is terrible. However, in fact death penalty restrain crimes. Then, I think that death penalty is necessary."
9893,I agree with you. I understand the huge danger of nuclear power and also nuclear power's efficiency. however as you said I think safety is the best thing that ever.
9894,"I also want to become a mentally strong person. However, the road is very tough and I think that we must sacrifice some of our lives. I would like to find all the way to be devoted."
9897,"I didn't think of the problem associated with the 2020 Olympic held in Japan, so I think your opinion is really interesting. The Olympic is held in Japan, but we shouldn't be the attitude that foreigner should follow us. And I think that we also shouldn't change even all the tradition we have. Where to change and where not to change, we need to discuss more."
9898,The picture such as 'Women of Algiers' are one of the most important things that it teach us what is beautiful. However the picture is too expensive. There are other ways to pay money better for rich people. For instance they can help poor people in developing countries.
9899,"Neither do I. I don't know about manners in other countries. We have to be careful because we, Japanese, are ignorant of religion, and we may heart others unconsciously."
9901,I totally agree with your comment. It is very important for Japan to use and develop more renewable energy. I still remember how awful the Fukushima disaster was and hope Japan will stop using nuclear power immediately.
9902,"The problem of religion is very sensitive. So I think that Japanese people should not give an opinion, but I think that it should be more tolerant for tourists."
9904,"Japan is a democratic nation, so Japanese government should be more responsible about its politics."
9905,We should be more interested in Japan's energy issues and think about the danger of atomic energy.
9906,"I strongly agree with you. it is true that prime minister Abe lose some trust , but Abe has been doing his best so far. So, I also want him to make clear explaining and don't want him to lose his position."
9907,"He was a great person and I look up to him. We are tempt to make goals about various thing, but it is very difficult to make efforts toward them and accomplish them. I thought I would like to take pains my goal in my life."
9908,"In Japan, people do not yet take so much care of LGBT people. We should pay attention to them."
9909,I agree with you. Mr. Miura is one of the most wonderful man in Japan.
9910,"I was very impressed by this story. Her intent is very strongly and supporters around her is very nice. If I'm her position, it's impossible to do that. I will cooperate such charity."
9911,"I agree with you. They have different opinion and sometimes these opinion may oppose each other. It connects to the religious war sometimes. So that Religious problems are sensitive. It is difficult to understand each other, but we have to know about that other people have another opinion."
9912,We don't know about the religious rules and it is near impossible to understand all of the thoughts. Especially we Japanese have no state religion so we don't have ideas to take care for the religious taboo. We have to know it is normal that have religious rules in the world and we should take care about that.
9913,"I have a gay friend in foreign country.(I won't say what country is because it is a personal information) But that guy was saying that he is a gay to other people openly and I was surprised about that. In Japan LGBT problem aren't familiar so people who are LGBT cannot say it openly. From the article, this action is very good way to spread the thoughts of LGBT. I think Japan should do this, too."
9914,"The purpose of the traffic light is set for traffic regulations. I think the movement calling for the elimination of gender discrimination is very wonderful. However, I think that it is not desirable to use traffic lights that protect the lives of many people."
9915,I agree with you. Because Japanese social security may not be able to be continued by increasing the number of elderly people in the future. Then the pension system will collapse. We are forced to save money for the future.
9916,I was very impressed with Yuichiro Miura's success. It is not easy to success to climb the top of Mt. Everest and the 80-years old man made it. This needs a strong resolution and I thought want one thing to become enthusiastic in my life.
9917,"I think using the geothermal is very good idea. In Japan there are many volcanoes and it is said that Japan is the volcanic country. If we use this energy source we came create more energy, but there are few problem for this idea because it takes too much costs to make a power plant for the geothermal. We need to remind this, too."
9920,It is very difficult to define the word moral. In the world there are a lot of opinion and belief and maybe each person have different thoughts. So that we cannot share the standard of moral. However Facebook are used by all of the world so it cannot help that occurs these types of problem because it is impossible to standardize the rule or belief.
9922,It is sure that there are a lot of problems of politician and money and these topics are arguing in the Diet all day and I think we have more subject matter that politician should discussion. However these types of problem are relating to the money we paid for the nation so we cannot ignore about this.
9923,"In modern times, I think power is not a means of 'assertion'. Missile launch makes the neighbor country very uneasy. I think that each country must cooperate in order to develop the world. Everyone needs to think like this."
9924,"Honestly, I am not in favor of some of his policies and his firm stance. So, I hope he would be discouraged by this scandal. Also I think he should be responsible for this series of scandals."
9925,"Facebook is one of the biggest SNS. So it can give influence for people. Facebook discriminate few people, it means they are injured by many people. Media be careful such thing."
9926,"I do not know foreign country's rules, but I thought we should pay more attention cultures of other county or district. Now we communicate various people, so it is important to know about various culture."
9927,I agree with your opinion. Politician keep himself clear. It is difficult to tear politic and money. However he is the prime minister of our country. I wish him to be honest.
9928,"In SNS, people are likely to say hurtful words because they cannot see each other's face. When we use SNS and communicate with other people in it, we should pay attention to our words."
9929,"Japanese society is also called super aging society. In order to prevent the decline of the birthrate, we are working on measures to lower the birthrate and aging population, but I believe that realization of a society where the elderly can work is reasonable. I think that Japan can make a society which young people and the elderly workable."
9932,"When I read this article, I was so surprised. Because I couldn't understand the worth of this picture. Of course I know the name of Picasso and his famous pictures. However I can't understand what he meant to draw such a difficult pictures. Moreover I think that pictures are should be more understandable. Because there are no information. Therefore I don't like Picasso's pictures"
9933,I think multinational companies should pay more taxes .Because I think taxestaxis should be paid equalty.take it for granted that strong company win in global capitalism. But the system that winner can get away the tax is not fare and could not be allowed.So I think to create the system which can not get away taxestaxis anybody else is most Important.
9934,"I think credit is very very very important in politics, because politics especially democracy cannot be exist without this.Considering this, despite whether he actually caused a scandal or not, he has accountability about this disputable problem.By doing so, he gets possibility that he continue to have his status."
9935,"The essence of this problem lies in a man called Shinzo Abe. However, in order to solve it, it is necessary to reform the consciousness of the surrounding people including Chief Cabinet Secretary. I think Japanese people need to be more concerned about politics."
9937,"I think Abe prime minister have some problems. For this short span, he happened two big scandals. I think that this is odd very much. But, I think he should not resign his position, because he pile up the relation with foreign country. It is wasteful that this relation is broken."
9939,"I think multinational companies should pay more taxes as well as other ordinal companies. It's not fair. In terms of economic, this system is important for the world business. But I think it's not good for me and change to fair system."
9940,"I was very surprised to read this article. I think using drag should be not done. If this action made them decrease drag user, his policy is too dangerous for public. I think he should rethink other ways."
9941,"Although it is not permitted to slander specific people, everyone has the right to express everything freely. And you can also block someone you don't like, therefore you can choose what to read in SNS. So the photo of a plus-sized model should be allowed to be posted on Facebook, I think."
9942,"It's not good to think that these two scandals are alike. Especially, Kake Gakuen is designed to make Japan's veterinary medicine equal to Western countries' ones. Ehime prefecture has made a lot of effort to realizes this project for many years."
9943,"I think increasing elderly people is a serious problem. We should solve and improve the problem quickly. Now I have no concrete idea to solve, but I hope someone make good way to deal with this problem."
9944,"I didn't know that sleep is very important for our health so much. I was very surprised that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease is related to sleeping. Recently I stay up late and sleep very short time, so I think I must change my life style."
9945,I watched the scandals on TV news. When I heard them I was so surprising. I think Abe should apologize honestly if he did such a bad action. And I want him to make our country more better .
9946,"Kanji(Chinese letter) is one of the most ancient language system. As a Chinese I know the advantages and disadvantages of the Chinese letters. One of disadvantage is that it is difficult to write Chinese letters particularly in the 'age of email'. Not only Japanese is losing ability to write 'kanji', Chinese is also losing ability to write the Chinese letters. In science fiction called 'The Three-Body Problem', people will use a language mixed by Chinese and English in the future. I think it will come true."
9947,i do not like the drug. i hate the buyer more than user. but killing is more terrible thing. no one have the right cutting off human life. i disagree the Duterte.
9948,"I was really impressed by this news article. I was astonished that person who had been in prison for 27 years changed the country dramatically. I believe that important thing is not to give up anytime if something terrible happen, and not to look at the past but the present for the future to find what we really should do. Even if we stumble and lose our hearts, Nelson will encourage us not to give up by memory of his great achievement."
9949,"North Korea can be a threat to Japan. Currently, Japan is restricted by the constitution Article 9. We have no way to fight but to protect ourselves. We must pay close attention to the nearby country which can attack our nation. I firmly believe that the best way is to keep warning them and to give strict economical sanction."
9950,"I agree with you. I think the drugs should be eliminated in the world. But life of man is very precious, so I think it should be avoided to kill immoderately by bomb."
9951,Japan's labor force will decline due to aging.In order to solve this problem I think that it is useless just by countering the declining birthrate.We should promote women's advancement in society.
9952,"I think that it is a serious problem that Japanese can not write kanji.In recent years, electronic devices have become widespread, and the act of writing characters has decreased.Kanji is Japanese culture. So it is better to have a custom of writing characters."
9953,"I agree with your opinion. In recent years, the number of people interested in politics is decreasing, especially for young people.I think that the attitude of the people to politics will change by getting information from themselves."
9954,I'm sorry. I was mistake. This reply is to [ID1734].
9955,I agree with your opinion but I think that media should pick up not only negative points but also positive points.And we should think this issue deeply.
9956,"I think we should respect how other people live as long as they don't violate other people. I think the fat women doesn't violate other people because I didn't feel uncomfortable to see fat people . However, there are many people so \some people feel uncomfortable to see the picture . It is difficult to make a guideline which regulate what is allowed and what is not allowed . so people should be more tolerant to some extent."
9957,"It is almost clear that Mr.Abe didn't anything which is illegal. No evidence which Mr.Abe gave money illegally was to be found. First of all Mr.Abe wanted to increase the number of Veterinary Faculty for lack of veterinarians. But JSVS applied pressure to restrict the new Veterinary Faculty. So Mr.Abe decided to allow the Kake to establish the Veterinary Faculty. However Kake's top is Abe,s friend so he was doubted to prefer this school. In conclusion ,I think Mr.Abe has no fault."
9958,"Actions Russian hackers took is wrong. Do what Russian people Originally, athletes should be clear of doping ."
9959,"Actions Russian hackers took is wrong. Do what Russian government should do is to reflect own mistakes. People often think an international sports competition is a place to enhance the glory of the nation. However, I think sports should be clear of politics problems."
9960,"There is no doubt if wars were to break out between North Korea and US, Japan would be in a danger due to the geographic situation. The government should think carefully about this problem and try to avoid conflicts."
9963,"This question is ridiculous. I don't think you can judge whether students are proper or not to be lawyer by this question. Moreover, the question must have made female students unpleasant. People who are responsible for making tests should pay enough attentions to students."
9965,"This question is ridiculous. I don't think you can judge whether students are proper or not to be lawyer by this question. Moreover, the question must have made female students unpleasant. People who are responsible for making tests should pay enough attentions to students."
9969,"I was surprised to know that it was actually done in France, because I thought France was more liberal thinking country and not discriminative. And I was also surprised that the prime minister defend the discrimination. I absolutely agree with Ms Alshelh especially the part saying 'there shouldn't be a connection between terrorism and Islam altogether. '. Not to improve the discrimination against the Islam people, I think that we should see the ISIS more political group not religious group."
9971,"I think that it is really difficult to maintain the concept of 'the prize for peace'. Especially those really famous prizes like Nobel prize, cannot be without being effected by political intends. Particularly the Nobel prize is giving the prize for the peace so it sometimes seems that Nobel prize justifies particular sides or people, and I think this is really gangrenous. We need to see the prizes realizing that there can be some intends behind those."
9972,"I think that 'asking the users what kind of pictures are inappropriate for them before they start using Facebook.'cannot be the solution. Because the problem is what is the border of inappropriate or not , not the kinds. For example, even if the user choose the sensual photos for inappropriate, it doesn't solve the border problem. So solving this problem is more difficult. I think this problem will be solved by being issues like this news."
9973,"I agree with your opinion. I also want to live in a clean country, and I really love sea food! We cannot take the responsibility from nuclear energy plants like the wastes from them or the accidents. I heard that the waste from nuclear energy plants will not disappear for thousands of years. For our land and also for ourselves, we should try to depend on other energy."
9974,"I doubt that she really believed the Buddhism. Because if she learned the Buddhism i think she would not have tattooed on her body, and I have never seen those monks who have tattoo. I think that 'hurting the local people's feeling' related to this. Seen from the people who really believe the Buddhism, she is not considered to be one of them. She should have learned more about the Buddhism before she tattoos on her body I think."
9975,"I disagree with you. The individual rights should be before the public welfare. Freedom of belief is a fundamental right for human, so it shouldn't be invaded in any case."
9976,"I think American people want any change in their country. Though Trump's statement has some problems, many Americans believe that he makes America different from the one of the Obama government ."
9978,"You cannot force Japanese people have more children, but you can make the surrounding where it's more easy to have children. Many Japanese don't really feel that the problem is very serious but quick measures are needed before it's too late."
9979,"Now, Abe administration don't have powerful counter. So, we can not change cabinet."
9981,"Although it is not permitted to slander specific people, everyone has the right to express everything freely. And you can also block someone you don't like, therefore you can choose what to read in SNS. So the photo of a plus-sized model should be allowed to be posted on Facebook, I think."
9982,Now It is difficult to distinguished public from private.
9983,I'm disappointed in a Japanese politician. I want that they have awareness as a leader.
9984,Many people think scandals are often caused in politics but I think scandals should be stopped.
9985,"I learned that reminding the privacy and secure concerns is most important from this news. The system sounds very convenient and secure, but it has big risk of being hacked and stolen. If we don't forget its risk, we can use it more comfortable."
9986,"It may be related to diplomatic problem between Japan and Korea. We must not discriminate against foreigners, so we should held ceremony in the same way as a Japanese."
9987,"I disagree with Trump because we should respect people who are sacrificing their bodies for the country. Also, I think he should not use twitter to say such a important issue because it would be difficult for us to understand how serious he is and make us confused."
9988,"Suzanne's opinion is true, I think, because the sanction have no effect on the North Korean leadership. He still behave recklessly, and he doesn't listen other people even trading with them might be going to stop. So just attacking is not effective, but we should bring North Korea back to negotiating table with other countries."
9989,"In my opinion these sanctions are effective if all countries did them. even United states and Japan are doing sanctions, China and Russia are trading with North Korea, it would not work. and I also think negotiation is one of the big solution for this problem, but also it seems like we are admitted or given up with North Korea. I think North Korea's behaviour is terrible and hope they stop this soon. My father is living in Korea now, for his job, so these news are more close to our life then before. Hope it will be fine soon."
9990,"I think his military policy is illegal because if my memory is right, Constitution of US hang out free and equality of people. Also I have the image that American citizens are relatively welcomed sexual equality, so his tweet disappointed me. I hope Transgender people in military will treat with respect surely and they feel comfortable, also his policy will turn better."
9991,"I am afraid that North Korea will do a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific Ocean, so I want to stop North Korea from testing. The sanctions take much time the and are not having any impact on the direction of the North Korean, but I think it is bad to stop North Korea by using weapon."
9992,"I think Koike should send Eulogy for Koreans to maintain friendly relationship. I want to live in the safety country and in peace. If I were Korean, I would be angry and make a march.So, we should think from the standpoint of the opponent."
9993,"As living in a country that doesn't have military, the problem is not familiar to me, but I don't really understand why Trump prohibit transgender people to serve in military. Even if they are different from the most of the people, they are still having the will to protect their own country and literately sacrificing their own body. It's nothing other than discrimination. Also I think it's inappropriate for him to announce serious issues on twitter, because it reduces the seriousness of the problem."
9994,"I think that Aung San should be hard stance to Rohingya crisis,because she has to gather population from home and abroad so that she can govern Myanmar smoothly."
9995,"I think there are not differences between transgender people and us. So transgender troops can work in the military as a solders. In fact, they took some cost in the military. But I think they never be burden and they can be useful in the military like many solders."
9996,"What this man, LOGAN SMITH, did is not extremely bad, although I do not think he should have done this on internet especially twitter.. if he posted on twitter, everyone can see it and there might be violent person who are going to attack them. So, Smith should have just told those pictures and their informations to their company or police or those. Any way I hope there will be no haters or racists all over the world, and Even they dislike them(non-whites or any other those people), they should not be open about it."
9997,"I think it is terrible that the Myanmar government interpret Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although they have lived there for long time. Their rights and opportunities should be protected."
9998,"Heat is important essence for not only this case, but also all over the world. In this news, three hurricanes treated as a huge problem, but I think each country has different natural disaster and climate change. For Japanese people, earthquake and typhoon are very huge problem. I think heat is also problem for us."
9999,"I just thought that this new economic sanctions are not so different from past sanction(just being more restrict) so I guess the sanctions are not effective, but as you said if all countries do them, they can work well. Of course we should not be given up with North Korea."
10000,I think that Tokyo governor Koike Yuriko has to send eulogy for Korea. It is because the relationship Japan and Korea should be stronger against North Korea threat. this is an only way war does not happen.
10001,"I was born and raised in SAFE Japan, so I didn't know that there're places where women don't have the choice to play and enjoy sports. Nadia Nadim is not only a football player, but also a medical student now and has the dream to be a person who can impact other people's lives. I was so impressed by this. I learned from her to keep on trying everything I can and to believe in myself is the best way to find them. Though I don't have any clear goals for my future now, I want to be a strong person like her."
10002,"I was impressed to hear this story. I imagine that Nadia had a hard life in Afghanistan where women don't have any rights. She said it is amazing to be able to do what she wants to do. I didn't realize how happy I am, who can do anything I want. Hearing the news, I thought sports is one the great way to support people to get along with. As she said, when you are playing sports, you don't have to care about the color of skin and religion. Also, I was really surprised to hear that she goes to the medical school, because she wants to help and empower people. I think it would be really hard to complete two things, going to the university and playing soccer as a professional, so I respect her so much. She believes everyone has a second chance. I agree with her, and I also think that everyone should be given a second chance, even thought their first chance was failed. Nadia has a second chance, and she also has a talent of playing soccer, but not everyone, not every refugee has a talent and second chance. I believe all the people even the refugee should be given a second chance, to be successful."
10003,"I agree her opinion because her stance in Myanmar is most important for summarizing her country. But, certainly, I consent to be criticised from the point of international view. Because she receive the Nobel Peace Prize."
10004,I think the facial recognition technology to unlock the device is cool and great technology. However I think the fingerprint authentication is enough to secure our iphone. My iphone protect by the fingerprint authentication enough. So I hope Apple to exploitation something revolution function. The facial recognition technology to unlock the device isn't necessary for me.
10005,"Facial recognition technology to unlock the device is very comfortable and attractive. But we can live without this technology and this technology may cause some problems such as Russia and the U.S.,which threat our privacy. So I don't want to use facial recognition technology and protect privacy. And if we don't use this technology, the real concern Garvie said will not occur in the future."
10006,"When I read this news I was so surprised. I found the social media has big influences. Now I also use Twitter , so I think I have to take a moment to think before i press the send button with someone else's name and photo in the message. And I hope the people use SNS take a moment before they press the send button."
10007,"When I heard about this news, I was a little bit surprised because I don't know much about refugees. I m not that familiar with refugees because Japan accepts few refugees. I strongly believe that Japan has to accept more refugees than now. First, Japan is now criticized for not accepting refugees. To have good diplomatic relations with other countries, Japan should welcome refugees. Second, now, Japan is short of hands for helping elderly people. Japan can provide this kind of work. Accepting refugees is worthy of doing for Japan."
10008,"According to SIMON, these hurricanes are unusual and connect with climate change. However, I am not really sure the climate change is TRUE. I think human beings are too 'proud'. We are so proud that we believe that we have the power that can change the climate. Maybe the climate is just something that we cannot control."
10009,"i think that naming and shaming is not a good way to battle, because it may have too big effect in a real world , and it doesn't give a place to object to that person. And i don't really understand the purpose of naming and shaming, because it only punish the racist and doesn't try to discuss or change the mind."
10010,"I agree with the opinion 'People should take a moment before they press the send button.' that David Clinton Wills said. It is because it may cause misunderstanding, the misuse and so on. In fact, there are some incidents about the right of privacy. Also, in some cases, it change somebody's life."
10011,I was moved with her strength of mind to get over trouble. Many people have got power and hope to see her playing a soccer. She said that she want to do something that impact other people's life. I learned we should not give up our dream and we should continue to challenge anything. I hope for the society for refugees to live happily.
10012,"North Korea announced the plan a missile will reach to Guam passing through Japan, especially Shimane, Hiroshima and Kochi prefectures. In my hometown Hiroshima, everyone has become to pay more attention to speech and behavior of Kim Jong Un, Trump and Abe more than before. There were some drill for missile in these prefectures."
10013,"From this news, I learn a lot, and there are not only positive but also negative aspects regarding Face Recognition Technology. For positive side, I reckon that you comfortably use your devices such as iPhone, due to the normalization of Face Recognition Technology. On the contrary, problem of security and privacy would arise in our society because some use this technology in an incorrect manner. It is crucial that all the public should deeply understand about this technology that has both its good and bad aspects, and continue to cope with it carefully. I believe that this would prevent us from using this technology in a negative way."
10014,"I can understand what president Trump said. Although, those transgenders are working for country and they are risking their life. So I think he should not said those comments. But in other hand, those transgenders also have to understand that everything would not be what they want. I think even non-transgenders are having some trouble during their training or workings. And I If those cost for those transgenders are so expensive, there need to be some solution for it either."
10015,"This news disappointed me a lot, because United States always led other countries to the way of sexual equality. I think the prime minister's new policy makes people's anger. Trump should respect the people who are working or worked for their country even they are transgender or not."
10016,"What she has done are understandable if we see it from Myanmar position, because what she does are all for Myanmar. Although, seeing from international view, it's not really good. I don't know well about Rohingyas but they also have rights to live safely and peacefully. I heard that if someone once get novel prize, it won't be taken away, and I think it's okay, but she should find other way to solve these issues. I also wants to know what local people in Myanmar think about this."
10017,"New technology makes our life better, however there are risks and we often don't realize that risks. I think face recognition system is very convenient, but It's too much for me. I think ordinary people can't understand what happens when they use new technology services, and can't control it. We should pay attention for security before use new thing."
10018,It may be difficult to imagine a society with many races because Japanese people are consisted of the single race.It is true that our custom and culture are different from those of other countries.But we and they are all human beings.So we must not discriminate against them and they also must not discriminate against us
10019,I think the facial recognition is convenient and wonderful.Apple is at the forefront of technology and I look forward to the future.I think that even fingerprint authentication is very useful but I'm looking forward to what face recognition is like.I would like to keep an eye on Apple's trends.
10020,"Social media can influence people in many ways. I've never imagined that twitter is used for the racism. I think we can use social media easily but it may bring some influences in wrong way. If you have something you want to tell people, I think you should choose the way to tell that carefully."
10021,"When I listened to this news, I was shocked and sad. If Japan accepted refugees,I would refuse this idea.It is because refugees may threaten Japan's safety.However, since Japan is obliged to accept refugees as an advanced country, I want you to have a firm acceptance system."
10022,"I think that what she did for Myanmar is great and proud.However, from the international point of view I think it is not good.It is difficult for Japan to be recognized worldwide, but I do not want many enemies"
10023,"Although there are various understandings of history, I think Koike couldn't help meeting with the public opposition. That is because she sent eulogy by convention last year. It's true that we don't have to identify group for giving eulogy, but in order to maintain good relationship between Korea, Koike might have sent eulogy as before."
10024,"I think her decision was not good. Even if she had no control over the military,she had to show her intention as soon as possible that she cherish the lives of all the Myanmar as a factor leader of Mynmar.Any way,if she want to make Myanmar peace country, she has to seek for the way to control the military."
10025,"I'm not sure that such a bad result occur by the emergence of face recognition.But, I suspect that such a high technology function is not needed if it has potential danger. For example, on the iphone,we can rock the iphone by the recognition with fingertip or number .Comparing these functions with face recognition, its convenience is almost same. Therefore, I think face recognition system will not popular for the people."
10026,"According to article,the last unusual and strange hurricanes was related to climate change such as global warming. However, I think it is early to believe so.Some scientist are claiming that global warming do not occur. They say,from the view point of long term, it's not climate change.I think that it is foolish and dangerous to believe every incidence is related to climate change. We need more search."
10027,"I disagree with Trump because we must not discriminate anybody around the world. Of course, some are the rich, and others the poor. But we are human. In addition, they are soldiers fighting for our peace. So it's important for us to resist him."
10028,"It's certain that heat will become the big problems all over the world. And we can feel natural power now from the last hurricane. So I think we should act somethings now. However, it's not enough to solve heating. We need to put all environmental issue in perspective because environment affect each other. I try to study the good way to solve environmental problems."
10029,"When I read this news, I felt the mental strength of her under any circumstance and was deeply moved. These days,in Japan, young people sometimes lament that they can not realize their dreams because of lack of chances.However, If they learn about her life, can they say that they has no opportunity? Of course they can't. I wish more Japanese people learn this news and think back their lives."
10030,"We have to cope with North Korea's problem as soon as possible. But as this article, we have not been able to take effective sanction against North Korea yet. As a result, we are exposed threats of nuclear now. I think Japanese administration should cooperate with other countries more."
10031,"I think her action raised the consciousness to women's sports. In Japan, almost people can play some sports if they want including women. Also, it is normal for us. However, some women can not play sports freely like Afghanistan because it is not normal and their situation is not good. Therefore, I think we are lucky and also we should make the world more free to play and enjoy sports especially for women."
10032,"When I read this news, I scared. It is because the technology is evolving and more and more complex. Then, almost people can not understand the mechanism and risk caused by new technology. Also, now we can not understand about these things. I mean, we can not defend ourselves completely. Therefore, I think we should treat new technology like this article more carefully."
10033,"I disagree with this statement. It is because there is no direct causality between the financial burden and the reason for refusing to adopt a transgender. According to transgender veterans, the soldier's gender has never had a negative effect on the result of the battle. In addition, because we thought that suddenly firing of people of transgender to reduce financial burden was 'discrimination' rather than 'reduction'. The American soldier who sacrifice own body in anticipation of reducing soldiers?"
10034,The problem is that it does not lead to friendship between Japan and Korea however Japan behaves.
10035,"It is necessary for us to think of effective solution for North Korea problem. However, in fact we haven't come up with any solutions yet. We should stop North Korea's action with other countries."
10036,"It is said that face recognition system has high security. However, I don't agree to use it for our cellphones very much. As this news says, this high technology has a possibility to be exploited badly. The higher technology becomes, the more people feel relieved and depend on it. So, I think what is important is that we pay attention to our security by ourselves and don't rely on technology too much."
10037,"As Suzanne said, I wonder the economic sanction will not help North Korea to stop to launch a hydrogen bomb. We need to find an effective way to solve this problem as soon as possible. Of course, the way must not be violent."
10038,All we have to pay more attention to North Korea.We should do everything we can do to prevent North Korea from launching nuclear missiles.I think Japan should not rely on the United States too much.We need to be helped by the United States.But we must protect our nation by ourselves.
10039,"I think Tokyo Gov had sent a eulogy annually for a long time.If Korea is pleased with that,Koike should have sent it as if the former Tokyo Gov did.Nowadays,the threat of North Korea has enhanced.So Japan must be on good terms with Korea."
10040,I was very sad to hear this news because many people died and lost their homes.But we cannot weaken a hurricane.What we can do is to predict how big it is and where it will go.We should listen to the weather report carefully and prepare for the emergency.
10041,"I think that we face the big problem. If the global warming proceed, hurricanes will be more and more big. Then, more people will sustain damage from hurricanes like these cases in this article. Moreover, they are many other climates change and create complex relationship each other. It will cause very big problem we can not expect. We should try good action for environment and we have to stop the global warming."
10042,"I think what Aung San Suu Kyi did for Myanmar is great, but this time her behavior leads a misunderstanding for the other countries and the world. However she has no control over the military, she should take an action to dispel the suspicion against her."
10043,"We should think and take an action for North Korea. Nowadays there a lot of news about North Korea that they did a experiment of Hydro bomb and it effects to Japan, too. I think Japanese are lack of attention about this problem. We need to think and consider measures what Japan should do about this."
10044,"I surely know that new technology is convenient for people's lives and it is necessary to develop our society, but I don't think face recognition is necessary and safe. Nowadays we depend on technologies and we don't pay an attention to our safety by ourselves. Face recognition is very convenient but there a lot of risks that cannot save our information. We need to watch out when we use every technology."
10045,"We are facing the big problem and we should think the measures to solve and protect our earth. This problem is not only about hurricanes, but also climate change and global warming. It is difficult to prepare for the disaster, so I think this problem is most hard thing to solve on earth."
10046,I disagree with Donald Trump's opinion. I think LGBT people are normal and there are more than we think. I think transgender is one of the view that people live and we should not discriminate about one's thought. So that I cannot understand why Donald Trump wants to discriminate transgender people.
10047,"I think this function is very epochal and convenient but I also feel it is little scary to recognize face because privacy and security may be threatened by someone.The function of now iPhone is to recognize fingerprint, I think it is also scared.I want Apple to develop new safe recognition system."
10048,"Technological development make our lives convenience. On the other hand, there are many breaches of privacy. I think Face Recognition tech also has risk. What we need is keeping a balance between Technological advancement and safety."
10049,I think that an environmental problem such as global warning is permanent problem.We should solve as soon as possible but I think it is impossible to solve perfectly because to predict climate changes is very hard.I think that it is important how to correspond and act when new environmental problem cause.
10050,"Social media has not only positive points but also negative points.It gives us much information and influence.However,there is also possible to give bad information and influence sometimes.So,this problem depends on our handling."
10051,I think Koike should send Eulogy for Koreans. She should not behave by her personal thought when we need to repair the relationship bet ween Japan and Korea.
10052,"When I read this news, I think she is so strong. And I think we should do action to achieve each dream. We have much time and many chances."
10053,"In some case, I dislike what Korea does or says but even though I think she should have sent eulogy. we should have good relationship to against North Korea. There are Korean who hates Japanese. she should not have done something that makes complaints from them. although usually Japan is too kind to Korea I think."
10054,"Hurricane is not so big, but it's so dangerous. It is made by climate change. Climate change gives many effects to the world. And climate change causes by global warming. In fact, if we want to stop hurricane, we have to stop global warming. So what we must solve is global warming."
10055,"because i have never been to such a dangerous country so I cant totally understand whats she thinks and how hard her life was. Although i wish she can have a great life by playing sports. Also i hope that any people can do anything they want. if there are anything that i can do for those people, I am happy to do that. for example ; donating money, accepting refugees in japan. although there are threat by accepting them. so the best way to solve refugees problems are solve their country's problems by themselves."
10056,"I thought privacy information is so important in this internet society. If we lost our privacy informations, we will have big damages. So we have to keep our informations carefully."
10057,"when I heard this I was so surprised and i think this is a wonderful technology, but however i am enough with fingerprint system or just passwords. actually my fingerprints are so thin and it is not useful system for me so just passwords are fine. also if there are such risks, i don't know that we really need that system. I am quite sure that i am not going to use it if i had that phone. also it seems really complicated to set."
10058,"The conflict in Myanmar is very complicated and the problem is not be able to solve immediately. Aung San Suu Kyi doesn't have right to control Myanmar's military and I can understand that she wants to avoid to break the relationships between chief of the military. If she wants to change the situation in the long term, she will treat this problem carefully. I know this domestic conflict has urgency and seriousness, but the new government led by Suu Kei doesn't have power to control it now."
10059,"I think that it isn't good to overturn ceremony continued for many years.Sending eulogy is important for relationship between Japan and Korea.Nowadays,Japan must corporate with Korea and America for protecting from North Korea.To that end I think Koike should send eulogy."
10060,"I thought hurricane is a complete natural disaster. According to this article, these hurricanes are related to global warming. It is a big problem human error make hurricane strong. We must solve global warming quickly."
10061,"After reading the conversation between the newscaster and the senior fellow and director at the think tank New America, it made me feel like the sanction that President Trump tries to take against North Korea would not work very much. I wonder what kind of action can stop them using the bomb."
10062,"When I first heard this news, I thought this technology is really cool and wonderful. Thanks to a lot of technologies, we can live more easier than the past. Although, every time when new technology invented, people always discuss about the privacy and safety. For this news, I thought this new technology is really cool, but I am satisfied with fingerprint system. We cannot live without these technology too much, but we have to care that we should not rely on them too much."
10063,"I think it's incredible that the scientists found new facts about such a tiny thing. It is clear that the progress of technology helped them study the field, and I am looking forward to hearing another news of new findings."
10064,"Actually , climate change has done some effect on our human , the unusual Hurricane in a matters of weeks ,is just one of those negative effects that climate change has brought to us . Global warming is a sever problem . In the foreseeable future some county will sink into the ocean due to the rising of sea level which is caused by global warming . I think we should reduce the using of burning oils ,coal . And we need to be Green Commuter ."
10065,"I believe that Koike should send a eulogy to make a better relationship with Korea. I understand that there are many view points of our history, and because of this, some people hate us, Japanese people. I hope two countries relationship would recover."
10066,"Well , I do not agree with the opinion that face recognition system is very unsafe . I think the concerns about the Apple new face recognition system is a little exaggerate . But I think the government should do something , like through legislating to prevent some negative issues happen , or regularize the standard of face recognition system ."
10067,"I think this passage says important points which we should be carry about when we use new technology.Today,various technology is being developed rapidly, so we can have new ability day by day.At the same time, we can more easily have access any means which harms others.Considering these things, establishing law before we start using some new technology is very important to prevent us from using it in the mistaken way."
10068,"I think this article tells us very important thing. Face recognition is useful system and it is very good to have this kind of new system in our life, however we should always keep in mind that someone could hack and stole important data or password.We cannot just focus on good point about new technology but also but point."
10069,"I think she brought huge impact on refugee and women. People tend to think that the things refugee people can do is limited, however she tried hard for everything and changed the image of refugee people. She says that anything is possible. This word remain in my heart and I believe this word strongly."
10070,"Hurricane is not usual thing in Japan so we cannot feel how dangerous it is and how it's changing recent years. However from this article, I feel that climate change is very serious problem. Maybe we can live our life with this earth but next generation or following generation might not because of climate change. We should take this problem seriously and take an action to reduce carbon dioxide emission."
10071,i was very surprised when i read this news. because i have been japan for all my life. so i am not interesting for problems of humans right. i thought ms.suu kyi is very difficult position...
10072,"I think privacy informations are the most important because it is Internet Society now. If we lost privacy informations, we will have serious damages. We must keep our informations and use Internet carefully."
10073,"I think the North Korea nuclear weapon problem is very thorny . Nobody will negate that this is a foreseeable threaten to our world . In my opinion , The reason that the matter has been far is clear . There is no certain trust between North Korea and America . All these two country's done is different from what they have said . So , I think the first step is to build mutual credit between these two countries , and then pull North Korea back from off-ramp."
10074,I think that this discovery is very important. Because understanding where gravity waves coming to the earth come from will be useful for future space development.
10075,"Climate change is a very important issue for us. Because we have changed the Earth that was an environment where we could live comfortably with our own hands. Global warming is a problem, but there are many other environmental problems. I think that it will become more important in the future to solve them one by one."
10076,I think the economic sanction on North Korea is not effective. North Korea has dangerous ideology. So negotiation is more effective than economic sanctions. Donald Trump should change his policy.
10077,"There is no doubt that the face recognition system is convenient. But I think that advances in technology are at risk. The portrait right of many people is infringed and exposed to danger if they are abused by face recognition system. Therefore, I think Apple can not go through measures to prevent information leaks."
10078,Face recognition is very useful but I have a question. I am a twin so I think it is impossible to recognize for iPhone. I want to try that.
10079,I disagree with Trump because we must not discriminate anybody. We should be equal and free. The thought of Trump prevents that.
10080,"I think America should prevent themselves from launching missile. That is because there is possibility which North Korea launch a missile. Thought in Libya case, to using any force is very effective means, North Korea has enough ability to evolve war. Considering these things, America should think this more seriously."
10081,"It seems that Japanese people are not about to know deeply about the problem of North Korean missiles. Because of it is peaceful, Japan is not so familiar, but I think that it is better to know the relationship between other countries and North Korea."
10082,"Climate change is a serious problem for us. It happened only in abroad in the past which made Japanese people think that it's not our problem, but currently the temperature is definitely rising in Japan, and we felt it ourselves. It might be too late but I think not only the people from where the climate change happened but also people from other countries must concern more about this issue."
10083,"By reading this sentence I was able to know more about the hurricane.Specifically, I learned the process of hurricane generation and the actual condition of hurricane damage.I hope that science and technology will progress and hurricane damage will be less."
10084,"I think if I were in such a trouble, I can not resolve by myself. So, we have to help each other in any situation. Absolutely, she asked someone help."
10085,"The more advanced technology progresses the more dangerous aspects.But even if there is a negative side, technological progress will make people's lives better.Every person must recognize the danger because it is a difficult problem."
10086,"Global warming is a big problem.On the other hand, we can't feel it seriously, but it caused these abnormal weather. In addition to this, it birth people who die. Though it is difficult for us to be familiar with it, we have to be more conscious about it."
10087,"It's probably difficult issue for Aung San Suu Kyi, because as a leader of the country she has to have good relationship between the military, but on the other hand she has to stop what the military is doing. The problem is that the government and the military is the different thing. Government needs to have power to control the military in order to rule a country."
10088,It is time we have to prepare against huge natural disaster. We know Japan has a lot of natural disaster. Little Preparation makes our future change.
10089,"In Japan, there are few hurricanes, so I was so surprised to read this article. According to this article, in America, there are a few big hurricanes, especially these days. It seems that the point of this is heat and the cause of this is global warming. So we should face this problem harder. We can't sidestep this."
10090,"I thought that facial recognition was very convenient. This can make our lives more comfortable. However, after reading this article, I found this has dangerous sides. Such as Russia, it is likely that facial recognition is used to exploit someone badly. Therefore, it is important for us to think about our privacy."
10091,"Although facial recognition technology is very convenient and cool, I am afraid of its privacy and safe risk. A stranger can probably unlock the device when I am sleeping. What is more, I think facial recognition technology is pretty convenient and cool, but we can live without it. Frankly, I think it is not necessary."
10092,"After reading this article, I found that there are a lot of view points of our history. I think that Koike should send a eulogy for Koreans to lead a good relationship. There are a lot of people who oppose Koike's reaction, so she should face these options."
10093,"I think everyone has the right that fight for his or her country, whatever this person is a man or a woman or a transgender. Thus, I disagree with Trump's Twitter. He may try to treat anybody equally."
10094,"My heart was wounded when I saw the news of serious damages in Texas which was caused by Hurricane Irma. Also in Japan, there are a lot of phenomena similar to Hurricane every summer, which are called 'Typhoon'. In this way, we have unusual weather everywhere in the world today. And the most of them result from global warming. So we have to consider how to solve this severe problem."
10095,I think Aung San Suu Kyi is awesome. She is great and wonderful leader. I want leader like her to exist in Japan.
10096,I think this action will be cause troubles between Japan and Korea.
10097,We can't avoid national disaster so we should always prepare for disasters. There are some things to decrease national disasters. We should make efforts to reduce global warming.
10098,this news is very difficult for me. because i don't understand science. but i can feel observation of the gravity wave is very amazing!!! i respect scientists who try to prove mystery of the universe!!!
10099,This is a crucial thing. But Aung San Suu Kyi stands on the difficult stage. I don't know what she should do.
10100,"I think discrimination should be disappeared. But putting this aside, it seems that there are few problems in such current case transgender participate in troop. So, I don't have reason i support this Trump's policy. But, there is one thing i think. This is that such opinion stems from 'America.' About this policy, this article said 'reaction was strong from critics and supporters alike.' Speaking of America, this country is said to be a human right problem's developed country. sexuality, race, and so on. But, it seems that America go back to conservatism, seeing Trump was elected. Isn't the current measure effective? I think through this news, we should think better about more and bigger thing."
10101,"Seeing the current situation, it seems that nobody know the most effective measures to stop North Korea. All we can do is be keeping negotiating ways and take a lot of measures."
10102,i was very surprised when i read this news. because i don't think the machine can recognize the person's face. so i feel in a SF world. the technologies are move on than we think.... i cant help expecting future!!!!!
10103,The sanctions which America imposed on North Korea at first seem to be a good solution for preventing hydrogen bomb
10104,The sanctions which America imposed on North Korea at first seem to be a good solution for preventing hydrogen bomb. But I think imposing sanction excessively is not a good idea referring to a precedent that Japan started the Pacific War after being imposed a sanction which banned import and export of fuel. So we must think another way to stop violent behavior of North Korea.
10105,"When I read the news, I thought this system is so great. That system can unlock more easily than former system. But I think fingerprint authentication is enough to unlock. Both of them are certainly good , so I want to use the new system someday."
10106,"I think Koike should send a eulogy to Korea. Massacre, the action itself is so crucial that it should be apologized. In these days, Japan and Korea are in a bad mood in many respects like a territorial dispute or historical backgrounds and so on. To build a strong bond between these two countries, she must take actions swiftly."
10107,"This news said the last hurricanes are connected with climate change.When I read this article , I was surprised. And I think human behavior makes climate change. So I think hurricanes are not related to it."
10108,"It is true that new technologies can make our lives convenient. However, I am against Face Recognition. One thinkable problem crossed my mind is 'if the owner of the phone is a twin, the iphone will be unlocked with ease. To the contrary, no fingerprints are the same. Face Recognition sounds really cool but it is unnecessary."
10109,"I agree that we need to have more powerful sanction to stop North Korea from conducting nuclear tests. However, as an expert said, sanctions took time and we cannot see the changes of the bad behavior of North Korea. It is high time we should look at the purpose of the sanction in order to keep peace in the war. If the US attack North Korea, WW3 might broke out. We need to keep an eye on the international affairs closely."
10110,"I know that there are complex misunderstanding between japan and Korea. This issue happened from a log time in history. However, in this case, I firmly think Koike should have sent eulogy to Korea. It is obvious that not sending eulogy will stimulate Koreans because sending eulogy was a part of Tokyo governor's job which had continued historically. I think we should not oppose Korea by this issue. She should have done alternative choice."
10111,"I had thought that nothing could be done to prevent hurricanes before I read this news. However, I learned that hurricanes are the result of global warming from this article. We should take actions if hurricanes can be prevented. We can hardly notice Global warming in our daily lives, but we should pay attentions to our behaviors and make efforts to solve this problem."
10112,I think Japan and other countries should make good relationships to find solutions about this problem. Now we are under threat of nuclear weapon. So I hope that Japan takes actions to solve the problem.
10113,"When I first read this article, I was amazed by the forefront technology today. I thought face-recognition quite surprising and interesting. However, I oppose this tech. The reason is that people's face might change. Time flies like an arrow, people get older and the shape of face can change dramatically especially small children. This can effect the decisions of which the new iPhone make. Although I like the concept and the unique idea, I think it is not realistic for its usage."
10114,"I was very surprised when I read this article for the first time. Although I heard the temperature change by the difference of the seawater temperature like the El Niño phenomenon and La Niña phenomenon, it was not known that the typhoon greatly influences the temperature. I wanted to know more about this mechanism."
10115,I was very surprised when I had read this article for the first time. I was a surprise this time. friend may open a cell phone without permission when I was sleeping.
10116,"When I read this article, I also worried that this behavior would be a problem between Japan and Korea. People in Korea are also sensitive to this problem, so I thought it was necessary to act cautiously."
10117,"I was born and raised in SAFE Japan, so I didn't know that there're places where women don't have the choice to play and enjoy sports. Nadia Nadim is not only a football player, but also a medical student now and has the dream to be a person who can impact other people's lives. I was so impressed by this. I learned from her to keep on trying everything I can and to believe in myself is the best way to find them. I want to be a strong person like her."
10118,"Facial recognition was very convenient. This can make our lives more comfortable. However, this function has dangerous sides. Such as Russia, it is likely that facial recognition is used to exploit someone badly. Therefore, it is important for us to think about our privacy."
10119,"I was interested in this news from before. Their discovery is the important key for which we elucidate space mystery.By this discovery, the space limit and space beginning may be elucidated the near future."
10120,I was very impressed by this article. In japan there were so many rains in this summer. It was climate change. We have to stop global warming to save the earth.
10121,I was so surprised by this article. Face-recognition is surprising and interesting but it also have danger. We must careful about this.
10122,"This kind of issue has been caused all over the world and I think now is the time that normal citizens like us look and think carefully how those leaders act for the problem. Aung San Suu Kyi has been playing a very important role of protecting human rights for a long time. It is hard to believe that suddenly she does not care about the minorities. However, it is also true that she adhere to stay in the political world, and the fact is that the country needs her. I hope she could find some kind of good solution to this problem."
10123,"My opinion is that Aung San Suu Kyi should take some actions to protect Rohingya from military operations. She is the person who gave the Nobel Peace Prize and she has the right to improve their living condition as equal as the others. Not only saying about it,but also she should take action."
10124,"I think that Apple's attitude positively introducing the latest technology is very amazing. I think that the attitude actually contributed greatly to the creation of the iPhone. However, through this article, in addition to developing with the latest technology, I felt that I should consider how to use the technology."
10125,"When I first read the article about the new iPhone's face recognition system, I was wondered whether it's can be used with pictures or not. If it is right, privacy is not safe. Before we decide whether to buy or not to, we need more information so as not to be involved in any crimes."
10126,"The international situation surrounding North Korea is changing drastically, and as a result the conflict between the United States and North Korea is aggravation. The abusing each other of Donald Trump and Kim Jong seems like 'infantile quarreled' objectively, but I don't think so. I think that it is 'settled as a quarreled.' It seems like ridiculous on the surface but their position is the top of the politics of own country. I think that both are in a situation where they can't compromise for the nation. I think government officials are searching for means not do war. I pray that misunderstanding will not start war."
10127,"First what I thought about this article is that there are still so many discriminations even though lots people take actions to improve the conditions. Transgender problem is delicate, so Trump should take it more carefully."
10128,"Currently Japanese people cross overseas for travel and work purposes without worrying about race. The Japanese are single ethnic nations where different races do not intersect and the history of racial discrimination does not exist. Also, the young generation does not know the history of racial discrimination. 'The world without racial discrimination' is only a part of history, and we must make an effort to know 'the world in which racial discrimination occurred.' I think it is a very difficult problem. Because ideas rooted in people's consciousness can not be easily changed."
10129,"we, especially Japanese, have to not only be careful for North Korea's action, but have strong attitude towards North Korea. To build a good relationship between North Korea and other countries, countries should have mutual understandings."
10130,"What Donald Trump thinks regarding transgender is disappointing for me. I thought that America has tolerance towards various people including transgender rather than other countries, and it plays significant role as a role model. Thus, Tramp should deal with this kind of problem carefully."
10131,"I think these sanctions could cause the same mistake as you did at the Second World War. Too strict punishment makes the gap between countries expand, This means that national negative feelings lead people to the disaster such like World War III."
10132,"It is very difficult problem. The privacy should be protected. So we can think to leak on SNS is illegal. But should protect the privacy of criminal like them? They are harassed no SNS by leaked on SNS, but they harassed some people by their action. So we can think it is not illegal to leak on SNS. Like this it is very difficult problem."
10133,"Now, it seems that North Korea looks like Japan during WW2. Japan didn't have a talk with other countries and the war broke out. If Japan did that, it might not get the atomic bombs. Since the war between North Korea and other countries has not broken out yet, there are a lot of things we can do. All countries, including countries which have close relationships with North Korea such as Russia and China, have to deal with this serious problem in close cooperation."
10134,"I thought that the facial recognition technology was very attractive and I wanted to use it once, because it's very convenient and I'm really interested in new technology. However, I noticed that I didn't think anything about security and privacy before reading this article. Maybe there are many people like me who get the new iPhone without thinking important problem, it's dangerous for them. More dangerous thing is that people expose their information while they don't know, and the technology will be normalized. So, I would like to think about secure problem before getting new technology."
10135,"The hurricanes is not natural disasters, these causes were occur by people. So we have to stop the climate change. I think it's our duty."
10136,"Surely, the earthquake in 1923 is ancient history. So we can think it is not necessary to send a eulogy. But to send a eulogy is not difficult thing. And just sending a eulogy, this problem will not happen.So I think refusing to send a eulogy is not good choice."
10137,"Year by year, the times that I hear 'abnormal weather' is increasing. I don't know it is completely because global warming, but I know at least small relation. Our comfortableness make someones' death. That doesn't make sense. we have to try our best to avoid it."
10138,I was disappointed by hearing this news. I believed that Aung San Suu Kyi makes Myanmar perfect democratic country. But also I know that it is very hard to unite country one. I hope Myanmar will go to good way.
10139,"I know her position is difficult and dangerous. However I believe her actions or campaigns are correct. Because she was recognized by people all over the world, as you say."
10140,"There has been Rohingya people problem for many years. I guess every Rohingya people expect that Aung San Suu Kyi will do something to improve this situation, and this tendency is spreading all over the world. I know that she has a lot of things to do apart from this problem, but she has to try to solve this problem. If she does not, she will lose her population even faster."
10141,"Recently, there are so many news about North Korea. I think the sanction against North Korea should be hard. But there are innocent people in North Korea. They should be protected. I think the target of sanction should be not people in North Korea but the government of North Korea."
10142,"AI is very convenient for us to use as a part of out smartphone, household electric appliance and so on. Its system has been developing very fast these days, so the capacity has been beyond our imagination. The monitoring society project may be come true in the future. Actually, it may lead our society more secure and safe, but we will be governed by machine. I feel scare very much about such world."
10143,"I was so surprised about news I knew that those AI technologies are developing dramatically. However I have never thought this much. I think it is good to have AI as long as it supports our life, but I dislike idea of uploading our brain to those machines. I also have same question as this article, if machines are better than us and can do almost everything what can we do? I am interested in this news and I want to see if there are this kind of AI. It's like SF movies, but in other hand, I am little bit scary."
10144,"I think If artificial intelligence is to be able to do anything, human need is lost and it will decline after reading this article.Artificial intelligence is certainly convenient, but I think it is necessary to think about usage.I want to correctly use the discipline and use it."
10145,"I guess if artificial intelligence technology is developed more, it will help us. For example, AI give us advice to live more healthy, do housework instead of us. However, as some experts say, AI may outperform us and endanger us because AI have no heart like human beings. So, we should think deeply about any danger for people and we need some regulations."
10146,"when I read this article, I think we should send a eulogy to Korean people. Because I am worry about the relationship between Japan and South Korea. In recently, there are many danger in pacific ocean such as the problems of North Korea's nuclear weapon. And I think Japan and Korea have to create good relation to protect themselves safety."
10147,"People who were born in safe countries are free to play any sports, play outside, and it is natural that children can go to school while people in dangerous countries can not do so. I didn't think about this so much so I was surprised to read this articles. This article reminds me of not only about refugee, but also that not all the people from dangerous countries have to be blamed. Just a few bad people makes countries into bad conditions, so we should help many of people that are innocent. Also, we should give those children a chance to change their life better."
10148,"For me, god is an object of worship that is a little unclear and don't know that existence, but AI god is easy to understand its existence and people easily get profits from the worship. However I have a question that AI god can be the part of religion. I think AI based god is too real and it might be very dangerous. AI is much more leading than human's brain but I think we can not trust completely or depend on it."
10149,"I think AI is very useful and good for our life. At the same time I'm afraid of it. According to this article that machines will eventually be so smart that they will outperform all human capabilities. If AI works better than human, what should we do then. So I think we should refrain from using AI."
10150,"I got interested in this news, because I have heard that observing gravitational waves is very difficult. I really look forward that we can observe more valuable astronomic events someday thanks to this discovery."
10151,"Your opinion is very interesting. If people have new iPhone with face recognition, they need to hide it in their bag or pockets before sleeping."
10152,"These day, I often see the news about AI. So I knew to a certain extent that AI is rapidly developing. But it's beyond my fancy to make AI be God. I think AI is very convenient and it will become necessary technology. However, there is the possibility that our life change wrong direction by AI. We need to remember AI's risk."
10153,"I have seen many movies which depict the world that AI conquests the Earth of the human.When it comes to the AI, people often have negative image such as the shortage of job for human or the domination by AI.However, we must not forget that AI can be our friend who help our lives if we can control them. So,at first,we have to seek for the way to control AI."
10154,"I agree with you. If we attack North Korea with military power, we are the same with the country because we attack innocent people too. We should attack its government."
10155,"When I read this article, I felt refreshed because I have read many articles opposite side to AI. However, this article says the time is going with technology and we should change with them. I think that AI is surely convenient, but now, we can almost send our life without inconvenient. Then, I think it is enough for us. It is necessary that we think about the our life with the new technology, but I believe that we do not have to improve the technology more."
10156,"I disagree with the Trump's new policy. People who are sacrificing their body for the U.S. should be respected, and sexual minority should be treated equally if there aren't any special reasons. The military cost caused by transgender soldiers is not sufficient reason for the new policy."
10157,We do not need to be afraid of innovation too much.
10158,"I disagree with this Trump's opinion.I think every person should be protected to have a right to serve the country. Also,his policy is usually unreasonable things.In this case,I think there is no rational connection between transgender and financial burden. Finally,I think everyone including Trump have to treat people equally."
10159,"I think it is not good to prohibit women play sports, because everyone has the right to do what he wants to do. I respect that she is showing that right. In addition, she is not satisfied with the present and makes an effort to be a doctor. If there are many people like her, the world will change to the better. I am going to learn from her."
10160,"I think the new iPhone that use the facial recognition will be cold a lot in spite of privacy and security concerns because many people are interested in new technology. Our curiosity exceeds anxiety. If you are afraid of failure, you cannot make new things. I want to do by high risk high return, so I don't think that is Apple's fault."
10161,"God is invisible and uncertain for me, but the God based on AI is very easy to understand, so I think it is dangerous. I worry it will tend to ask for immediate happiness and accidents will occur. AI is very useful and irreplaceable for our lives, it is not good to leave everything to AI because it can not think about the feelings of others. We should aim for a good balance."
10162,"When I read this article, I was so scared that people are going to be control by the AI, which is made by the people. God is the one being to respect or believe, but it isn't exist in the real world and they don't have any intention, but AI is not. I hope the technology's improvement stop before we make a horrible thing."
10163,"I'm interested in Face recognition system to unlock an electronic device , and I think it's so attractive and convenient. But I learned from this news that Face recognition system also has a big risk. So, before we use Face recognition system, we should think carefully not to get involved in some trouble."
10164,"Natural disaster is really hard to predicted. Because natural disaster happen with so many factors even scientists can predict perfectly. But what is certain is that 'heat' is a big essence to change climate such as big wildfires, sequence of hurricanes. So I think we can't any more think hurricane is natural disaster and we have to take some actions."
10165,"I strongly disagree with Trump's decision . Soldiers are serving for their country with their patriot minds.So their country has to provide soldiers with perfect condition so that they can spent healthy time . Also , we have to think about political issue and sexual preferences differently so as not to make a wrong decision."
10166,"I think AI god is very frightening. That's because the got is a existence which many People rely on, so if AI god is born, it dominate people strongly. In addition to this, if AI god have an bad idea, people are influenced by it of course,and people have an bad idea too. Considering these things, we should establish laws before we start using it."
10167,"I think we should think about the use of social media more carefully. Nowadays, everyone has a cellphone and it means they have a way to spread information across the world in a moment.And And such information is not necessarily always true. So we should not trust such information , and instead , we should find right information by ourselves not to make wrong judgement.I think this is not only for the incidents in Charlottesville but also the our everyday use of social media."
10168,"I'm so scared what would AI do to us if they outperform us in the future, but at the same time , I'm a little bit excited to wonder how they make our life convenient. But, religion is kind of sacred thing .So if it's possible to make AI god in theory , we should not applaud the idea without thinking about the risk it holds. From the past, religion and technology always collide and also always compromise each other at some point. I hope this issue would be solved and would not to remain as Pandora's box."
10169,"Though we only have tiny brains to use, and our ability of thinking is really limited, there are still so many things that we, the humans can only achieve. I think it is impossible to create a robot that has a perfect character like a human, even if we have an advanced technology. If that were possible, it would be so creepy for us to live with those robots. Besides, if the AI should be created as God, I believe that our brains would degenerate badly. Of course we need some convenient AI to increase our quality of living, we should sometimes think by ourselves."
10170,"Anthony learning sees the artificial intelligence as the God.I am really interested in seeing a religion created.I want to see whether this new religion will attract many people or not.Most of the Japanese people say they believe in no particular religion.So perhaps,it will spread all over Japan."
10171,"The technological advancement is not necessarily good, because I think a part of jobs will be replaced by AI. For example, pharmacist. Pharmacist is a job which concerns with lives. If AI fail to prepare a medicine and the patient dies , who is responsible for the accident? So I also think that there is a job which should be done by people. What are demanded to us is not the replacement to AI, but the cooperation, wise use of AI."
10172,"I am so surprised at this news. I didn't know AI technology is developed like AI god. I think AI can make our lives easy because AI will do some human's works instead of us. But in increasing the population, if AI take place of human workers, people will be able to lose their job. As a result, there is a risk that the gap between rich and poor will spread more than now. So I think AI has hope and risk. And we should think about our further."
10173,"Although the innovation and improvement of technology may bring negative effect , like moral dilemma , less jobs for low capability labors , being dominated by the super AI . on my opinion , positive effects are more than negative effects . Tech is the most fundamental factor that improves our world , brings convenience to our life . changes our world , lifestyle .It is human that create techs, we do not need to be afraid of what negative effect they bring to us , because I think our human also have the capability to cope with those negative effects ."
10174,"I was really moved by this news. Even in this modern age, some place in world, there's still discrimination against women. I think she became a symbol of refugee, also women. I hope someday this world become the place where everyone can live hand in hand beyond gender, nationality, religion."
10175,"By reading this article, I found that AI would be a double-edged sword. On one hand, AI has a positive impact on our life, which helps daily life convenient. On the other hand, there are downsides when using AI, which can control people's brain in a negative way. Considering the two factors, I believe that we should use the AI carefully."
10176,"Technological development make our lives convenience. On the other hand,technological advancement often produce an ethical problem. AI has particular many problem. I'm scare that AI will go out of control.What we need is keeping a balance between technological advancement and safety"
10177,"I think technology gave a big convenience to our lives. But I think it is too much now. We should not cost too much to make new technology. And we have to use the cost to other international problems. So if technological advances have any risks to us, I think technology should not be grown up."
10178,aa
10179,I was very terrified when I read this news. Certainly AI is a convenient technology and some people's lives will be better by using AI. But developing technologies will swallow our human lives and a lot of problems will occur. Now almost people can live without any problems so I think such technologies should not be used.
10180,I think AI will enrich our lives very well. The AI will work in the situation that people will be unable to make sure what should they do.
10181,"I don't know AI in detail, but i have done programming. i was surprised then. The computer completely depend on programmer, so we must teach the computer about thing first to do, the next, third... If you call the most rational thing 'God', surely we will see spawning a new God sooner or later. But, i want to ask whether God is such a simple somewhat. People have something odd. It's fondness,moody, such like emotions. Being human is reasonable and unreasonable creature. If computer understand and manipulate these, computer will call God. But, I don't think the time is coming. 'Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real.',said Jules Gabriel Verne. I don't think the time is coming when computer can do thing even people cannot understand."
10182,The trouble which AI technology cause will be a big problem.We have to think it was really safe. In recently we can do anything at computers. It is very useful though it have also many risks. Japanese laws are not follow technology. In the article driveless cars was written. It was very scary. Society have to change rapidly.
10183,"I was really surprised at this news, because I did not have this kind of idea. I consider that how AI god carry out its will. If it changes its decision in some situation, what would happen to the believers? Also I have learned about the driveless car, and I thought it is very difficult to decide who to save. I am really interested in what moral decision AI will make, and it should make."
10184,Ethical problems arise if AI develops too much. I think that there are good and bad aspects of being able to control the ability of children before giving birth to children. It is difficult to receive only good aspects of technology development.
10185,"In my opinion, AI is now too powerful to control. The AI called Alpha Go which is devised by Google had won many top level Go players around the world, even the best Go player in the past. Now the designer of Alpha Go has claimed that Alpha Go has retired. However, AI has really beat our human beings. I am really afraid of it."
10186,"I didn't think that AI might be alluring. Because for example designer babies are beyond over the range of God and the natural consolidation. So, I cannot agree an idea which AI technology is God."
10187,I was interested in and investigated about AI before I read this article. So after reading this article I could not believe the god of AI. I think that AI is evolving rapidly and I think that it is foolish to stop it. I'm also excited about the evolution of AI from now on.
10188,"I thought it was interesting. In my opinion, AI cannot be a god in the future because they cannot understand the unpredictable happening in humanity. However, I think AI will definitely overwhelm humans in the aspect of calculation and analyzing statistics. Although we cannot beat AI, I think we should live together to realize happy society."
10189,"After reading this article, I was so scared. AI is developing dramatically, so this may take the place of us. However, there is another side. As mentioned in this article, AI will actually exist and hopefully will do good things for us. So in order to take advantage of AI, we should change our minds and develop them."
10190,"When l was a high school student, a teacher said at whole school meeting that AI would outperform human capabilities and many tasks which had been done by human beings would give way to Al intelligence in the future . I remember I was really surprised. I think existence of AI will suffer us."
10191,"There is a matter called the problem of 2047 :in 2047,the intelligence of AI may surpass that of human. Even if it is true, I think AI doing only one human cannot do is enough to be more wealthy , AI has to come to do what al of l the human becoming a bunch cannot do such as perfect prediction of market and earthquake. Let alone , AI can't be a god because even great scientists such as Einstein and Oppenheimer couldn't be a god."
10192,"I was surprised to read this sentence. AI is useful and I am rely on AI. I thought that I can't send my life without AI. However I know this AI's developing is dangerous now. If this developing will keep, the day will come that we are dominated by AI. Such future is so scary. We have to consider how associate with AI."
10193,"I was very scared when I read this article. If AI advances more and more, human being who created AI will be controlled by AI in some possibility. It's very ironic.Of course,there are good points in using AI,but I think we have to pay attention to the bad side too."
10194,"AI may great idea for the future, but I don't want to use because high technology may develop in high speed and we will not be able to control anymore."
10195,"Reading this article, I think that Japanese way of thinking to work should be reviewed. For example, these two women who died from overwork were never saved by surrounding employees even if they appealed at SNS. As much as that, I think that Japanese people are dominated by the idea that the work is the first. It is important to decide institutions, but I think that like the West in the West, we should change to the trend of giving priority o private life."
10196,"These two news are shocking for me especially because both of them are women. These days, women have playing important roles in business, but overwork have become social issue. When I hear the news like this, I consider how I should work in the future. We must create society where we can keep 'work-life balance'."
10197,"Japanese workers usually obey companies rules and likely to sacrifice their life style. I think workers have too many unspoken agreements or rules to follow and most of them don't say their opinions to improve workers' environment. When an employee commits a suicide, the company have problems for its working conditions but I think also worker should say something to remove overwork and ask for help. So, first we should make good environment that workers can say own opinions about their jobs easily."
10198,"Social criticism focus on the problem of long hours of working and the death from overwork since this case. Thank to this trend, the court made it a formal trial, but Dentsu has been fined 500000 yen only. I think it is too cheap. Japanese government should further review Japanese working style, but workers have to be careful by yourself because it will take much time to change working regime."
10199,I think labor standards should be strict because it is necessary in Japanese society to protect workers.I do not want to work for companies that do not work overtime or make employees work more than regular working hours.For that reason I want to be careful not to work for a black company in my hometown.
10200,"When I read this news, I thought Japanese working culture is strict than other country. I heard that Japanese are liable to strict to oneself especially in the work environment. Now karoshi becomes to the social problem, we and Japanese companies have to reform the work practices immediately and change the Japanese society to the good one."
10201,"I have heard the news about 'karoshi' like this article on TV. I think this is caused by the Japanese mood that working a lot is good. Therefore, many people are situated under pressure that we should work more. However, I felt sadness when I heard this news. Also, I think we have to change the shape of Japanese society and company."
10202,"I think sometimes overtime work is needed ,for example,when the work which you must finish by today is not finished.However,if you must always work overtime,there are many negative effects. For instance, the lack of sleeping must lead to the decline the efficiency of work,and the lack of the time to spend with family can be bad factor for their family.Therefore, the appropriate pace of overtime work is important."
10203,I think it's important for Japanese worker to consider how to protect themselves.
10204,I was surprised when I watch these news because these news was happened in famous corporations. And it's very regret in terms of both victims are women. Female walkers tend to get tired easily. So We should protect them. But this cases caused the worst result. i think that we have to consider how to work in Japanese society.
10205,"Though I have heard of this kind of news before, I was surprised that one of the most famous leading advertisement companies in Japan, Dentsu and also the well known broadcast organisation - NHK were spotted by the media and came under scrutiny. However, I thought it was in a way a great opportunity for us to know the truth of those illegal and inhuman working situation of those famous companies. Companies really should try to prepare a better working environment for the both young and old workers."
10206,"I was surprised at these news because they were happened in famous corporations.This indicates that even famous companies do not pursue the health of the employees' or good environments of the workers.So, I think strong measures which promote changing the atmosphere of working have to taken.I believe that we have to get rid of 'karoshi' ."
10207,"Actually , when I read this news , I was not surprised by the news , Because I had read related news before . Karoshi reflects the fact that Japanese economic stagnation . Due to the economic stagnation , Japanese young workers need to withstand more pressure to live and support the gap of pension raise their family . Besides , they also struggle with many heart diseases like depression . I think government and companies of Japan should do something to support young workers ."
10208,"When I read this news, I thought Japanese working culture is really terrible. I have heard this news before, but I had not known the number of people who died of 'karoshi'. I was so shocked to recognize it. I think I have to be more sensitive to this kind of news, because a few years later, hopefully I would work in some company. It is no longer another person's problem."
10209,"After knowing this news, I think that working standards should be more strict. There is little, if any, case in foreign countries that people die from working illegally long overtime. Therefore there is no word corresponding to 'karoshi' in foreign countries. Workers in Japan tend to follow their companies, even at any cost of their lifestyle. All companies must not sacrifice their employees."
10210,"I suppose that Japanese often think that working longer is better. Working is one of the essential parts in our lives. However, working too much sometimes makes us ill or feel bad ,and like this article, it can cause us to commit suicide. Right plan which more people can work safely."
10211,"These two news are extremely shocking. In other word the women killed by company, so they have to take the blame. Currently people work long hours in Japan compared to other country. This is the problem of Japanese society as a whole. The Japanese government should try to solve the problem earnestly."
10212,"There are many working situations which should be improved in Japan. In this case, the problem to be disclosed is big firms' like Dentsu and NHK. But, I think there are more problems of work in small and medium-sized enterprises than in them. The problem in there is difficult to discover. I think the way to solve these is required now."
10213,"I saw this on TV before I read this news. So I thought it would not be surprising. However, I was surprised by the small amount of compensation. People and money can not be exchanged, but I thought that was less. I also want to be careful not to enter such a company."
10214,"I think Japanese thought to working is too stoic. We are working too much and losing much times and power. In the world, people don't have such a much time to work, and they get many their rests. So they cannot die by working too much. I think Japanese government should reduce labor standards."
10215,"Japanese people are famous as the best hard workers in the world.Diligence is their brilliant nature and unique merit.However,work is not the object of our lives but means of our lives.You work and earn money to support yourselves and your family.When you feel that continuing to work may kill yourself,it is necessary to change your job.Yourselves are more valuable than money."
10216,"When I read these news,I was very surprised because I never thought overtime work was terrible enough to let a person die.I had thought a Japanese work system was set well .After reading these news I thought overtime work may exist in places just not in public.Government should investigate and improve right now."
10217,"I think this is serious problem especially in Japan. When I lived in America, I felt that American people are enjoying their life more than Japanese do. The reason why they enjoy their life more is that they are not restricted by their work. Japanese company should be more careful with worker's mental health."
10218,"There is a growing cognition that overwork is one of the most serious issue in Japan. I think that this phenomenon is caused by Japan's own culture which makes the workers have loyalty. Since this situation has both its upsides and downsides, companies and the government have to cope with this problem carefully."
10219,"I think 'karoshi' results from a pay differential in Japan. The youth seems to suffer from less payment than the elderly. Thus young people run into hard work. Moreover the token sums which Dentsu has to pay are too few at the cost of her life. If I were in her mother's position, I would never understand such behavior of the company."
10220,"I think Japanese works too long. It is not good for health. Not only working but also sleeping is important, so all of companies should improve working environment and working standards."
10221,"When I read the headline, I was so astonished that penalty of 500,000 yen for forcing staff to work illegally long overtime is not enough. People have the right to live mentally and physically healthy. It is clear that the company forced the woman to serious conditions. I strongly believe that Dentsu have the responsibility to apologize to her family and pay some more to show their reconsideration."
10222,"After reading this news, I feel that karoshi is really a serious problem in Japan. I think that cap overtime at 100 hours a month is still too long. In Japan, because of some company rules, young workers who want to promote to a higher office are hard to refuse the demand of overwork from their boss."
10223,"Karoshi is one of the biggest problems in Japan. Many Japanese are hard workers, and this kind of problem can easily happen. Recently, some solutions are done to improve this situation, but it is not enough. It it not good to work longer. We have to reconsider the way to work."
10224,"Recently, a word 'black kigyo' was listed in Japanese dictionary 'Korien'. The word means a company that habitually flouts labor standards. This news makes us realize that those excessive working has became overgrown."
10225,"Japanese workers work in earnest so they can't find their jobs too tough. Further more, although they are in very serious situations, they can't ask their companies to do something good for them because of their companies' strong power. So Japanese government should make not only laws about their work times but also environments which are kind of Japanese workers. I think two people's deeds written in this article must be important for Japanese future so we should remember them forever."
10226,"As it reported, Japanese people work too much. Japanese people work to get much money even if they get out of condition. Over working is often caused by companies, so those companies should be blamed. And they should not be allowed with only paying money. However, we also need change our view from much money bring much happiness to without much money we can be happy. For example, in Denmark, people work shorter than Japanese people, but they are happier than us, because they spend more time with their family and friends, or joining club activity. So I think Japanese people need change their view of working and take it easy."
10227,"Japanese is really hard working . But working standards in Japan are really bad and it's abnormal employee die because overwork. In America, the company forces employee to work over time would be punished without exception.But I think Japan's law system is made to protect criminals , not victims. So I think the fact Dentsu's incident was brought to light and they were punished was a big step to improve Japan's work standards."
10228,"I completely agree with what Justin said. It's a new idea that we should also respect boys' right to be not like a typical strong man, but they can be just the way they are. Some boys don't like to play outside or play sports, and they prefer playing with girls. That's what should be respected as one's personality. If we could accept and respect every person's diversity, it would be a unique and comfortable world for all of us."
10229,"I was thinking the same thing as you. Women are becoming to be an important part of the society these days, but the working environment is still not fully set. I hope I could contribute to make a better working environment for women."
10230,"I agree with him, too. In particular, I agree to his opinion about a true feminist. Those who insist 'I am a feminist' are not always feminists. It is difficult to separate between 'distinction' and 'discrimination'. In these days, it has been said that excessive feminism may give rise to 'reverse discrimination'. We should pursue true distinction of gender."
10231,I have to say this is very dangerous.We have to be most careful when we are so sure of what is right or what is justice. What you believe deeply easily can be 'religion' and you will reject and attack people you disagree with.The extreme example is 'Sea Shepherd Conservation Society'. they are terrorists because they attack people so aggressively for their belief.
10232,"When I read this news, I thought it's terrible. Those company, which we call black-company in Japanese, are forcing their employees to choose death even they are working for that company. I never want to work in those company. I don't really understand why Japanese have to work this long hours, because in most of country, employees don't have to work this much. We souls learn how other countries are working. I hope there are no more overtime work and people who commit suicide by extra work in the future"
10233,"I agree with your opinion too. Government is trying to solve this 'karoshi' problem, but it's not enough. I hope there are better working condition in the future"
10234,"I still don't really understand what feminism is. I think it's good that he said about feminism. Those saying by men are much more influential that women says. There are not so many feminists in Japan, I wasn't think about it before because There are not so many people saying about feminism. Maybe there are quite lots people or men that thinks women as inferior in their mind. I think everything can't be equal between men and women because there are physical differences. Although I hope every men and woman can have a comfortable life."
10235,"I agree with Trudeau's opinion that boys should be taught about the feminism and the importance of having equal rights between men and women. I think there is a limit even women work hard to make society that women have equal rights as men. To achieve this, men also need to try harder. The idea that cabinet with same number of men and women is very interesting for me, but also I easily imagine that we would take long time to achieve such cabinet in Japan."
10236,"Before reading this article, my image of Feminism was not good, because in many cases , Feminism activists are thought to be extreme . But the definition proposed by Justin Trudeau ,the prime minister of Canada ,changed my image of feminism greatly. But in Japan, there is still discrimination against women and also bias against feminist. So all of us have to change the image of feminism. By changing the definitions of Feminism , both men and women would be treat equally and can live hand in hand ."
10237,"I don't think boys should be feminist. I have a reason for this. Firstly, we have rights to think freely . Though there should be equality between men status and women status, forcing to have particular thoughts are very dangerous. As a result I think the thought boys should be feminists shouldn't be kept having ."
10238,"I can agree with the idea we should give the boys a sense of justice and empathy that is damaging to men and those around them. However, I believe that there is another good way to do that. For example, the environment around them has much influence for their identity.If we can raise up them well, they can be strong man and also the person who have a sense of justice and empathy. Therefore, we should seek for better idea not just only feminism."
10239,"I think Justin's opinion is right. Although I am a man, I feel it's important for men to be feminist. Now, male-dominate society is left strongly in Japan. So especially Japanese should think again about feminism. If we can work under equality between the sex, Japan's economy develop more and many enterprises grow more. Becoming feminist bring about lot benefits."
10240,"When the teacher asked us whether you are a feminist or not in the class, I could not answer quickly, because I don't know the correct definition of the feminism. Some say it is the idea that you should promote women's status and social participation. Other say it is the idea that you should deny the culture and custom that can be discriminatory to women. I think you can believe any definition, but will not be extreme and remember to work to make the world better."
10241,I also think it is difficult to completely eliminate inequality. It is taken for granted that there are difference between men and women and it is common to distinguish them rather than discrimination. I criticize the idea of ignoring physiological differences between men and women because they emphasize equality too much.
10242,"I also agree with most of Yoko's opinion. Everyone, not only men, should be kind to people who has different sex. Although there are limits for women, because we can not work as men do. we usually do not have physical strength as men do, and its natural that people who can work longer can get more payments. So I think both men and women should be mentally equal and both of them should respect each other."
10243,"I have never thought about feminism.Reading this news is a very good oppotunity.Men and women have many physical and mental differences.So I disagree with the idea that we should treat both of them equally.Of course,they should be equal in terms of law.But I think what is important is to try to understand and accept differences between men and women."
10244,"By reading this news, I think that the climate issues are very serious problems for us. Because it is said that the one reason which caused the hurricane is the global warming. And we have the responsibility of this disaster. So we have to cooperate to achieve the goal to stop increasing temperature. And I try not to use plastic bags."
10245,"I was very surprised when I read this article. When I finished reading the article for a while, I was very moved. At the time when the wall of sex is going on from now on, and era of generosity also for people with gender equality disorders will be made."
10246,"Well , I agree with the article's opinion. Now , almost due to the economic decline , most families' women need to find a work to support their family. At the same time , women also need to take care of babies . So , compared with the past , woman have to withstand more and more pressure than before . Unfortunately , compared with man , woman is still treated unfairly . So I agree with Justin Trudeau ."
10247,"I think overtime work is wrong. But to committee suicide is not good too. I think there more ways to escape overtime work, for example to consult lawyer, to leave the company and so on. Life is most important. So I think we should challenge many ways before we throw away the life."
10248,"I think the social developed is more increasing by increasing women's empowerment. And I think men can do housework too. So to increase women's empowerment, we should change our values. Now, there are a value that housework is women's job. But men can do that too. So this value is not true. We should change our values like this."
10249,"Actually, I don't know about feminism well, but I thought Justin Trudeau's opinion is great. In this world there is a little discrimination between boys and girls. This isn't the outstanding thought but most people have this thought unconsciously. I believe that feminism will correct this discrimination, even it is a little difference."
10250,"I agree with your opinion. I think in this world, there is a prejudice. For example boys should be like powerful and girls should be like mild. This is one of the thought, but everyone isn't. It is important to admit our own personality."
10251,"I think the opinion of Trudeau is very important. I didn't know well about feminism before reading this article. I suspect that there are a lot of people who don't know feminism like me in Japan. Actually, when our professor asked us whether we were feminists at the end of our class, there was a little people who said 'I am a feminist.' To begin with, we should understand what feminism is. Then we should try to make the world that is equal and free."
10252,"I was surprised to notice that the victims were all women from your comment. Why were victims women? I think , in Japanese culture women hadn't work in society, so women don't get used to work in society."
10253,I agree with your opinion. The technology advancement is not necessarily good. I think Apple face recognition introduction is thoughtless . Apple should make safety system in advance.
10254,"Death from overwork in Japan is such a longstanding problem. We know that working isn't everything in our own life. Recently, Japan attempts to curb death by overtime work with Premium Friday. By measures like this, I hope people change way of thinking for working."
10255,"I totally agree with you. We don't neither work to live nor live to work. Working is not everything no matter what the situation is. I hope, people in hard states related to overtime working, change way of thinking for working."
10256,I don't agree with the opinion of Trudeau. Because we have the right of thinking freely. So I think that nobody can force to be feminist. Of course the equality between men and women is very important. However I have a negative image for 'feminist'. Because I also watch the news that they insist only women's right. So I don't agree with Trudeau's opinion.
10257,I agree with your opinion. Because I think no body can force to be a feminist. Of course the equality between men and women is very important concept. However we have the right to think freely.
10258,"I was very impressed by the words that Matsuri Takahashi's mother said in press conference. 'There is no work that is more important than a life. When I heard this in the TV news, I strongly agree with. Because dead people cannot work no more again. If the people have the ability to do great works. And a lot of Japanese companies have the culture that 'longer working time is better that everything' I think this culture caused the serious problem such as Ms,Takahashi 's death. So I strongly insist that Japanese government should start to change the work condition rapidly."
10259,I cannot forget the word that Matsuri Takahashi's mother said in the press conference. And I hope that such serious incident never occur again. So I strongly insist that Japanese government should start to change the serious work condition rapidly.
10260,"I completely agree with Trudeau. Actually,feminism sometimes seems strong movement, but it just aims for gender equality. Women are having more working opportunities than before. I guess that movement brings the society new development and eliminates longstanding discrimination."
10261,"I feel the same way. Insignificant,trivial discriminations sometimes bring serious discriminations. The thought of gender equality is a key movement , I suppose."
10262,"Now AI technology is developing dramatically. I believe it's great and contributes to our society. However, I'm afraid that takes a place of us. Also highly sophisticated technology might be out of our control.I guess AI brings both merits and demerits for our society."
10263,"To tell the truth, feminism is not important idea, but what Trudeau said is the one of urgent things we should promote. To teach boys about feminist, next generation will be more familiar with women to live. In addition to his idea, I think we also need to raise girls to teach that they can have, tell and develop their own ideas. With these ideas, I wish more people can live equally."
10264,"I agree with Trudeau's idea that boys should be raised as feminist. The reason I think so is there are various people who have different idea. In order to live peacefully, we should consider each other. As Tokyo governor, Yuriko Koike, there are many women who play an active role in the work.So,we should think about feminism."
10265,"I agree with your opinion. I think it is important for men and women to have equal rights,too. I would like to see the world that women work harder same as men."
10266,"I definitely agree with Trudeau's saying, 'All of us benefit when women and girls have the same opportunities as men and boys.' But in Japan, I think gender discrimination seems to still exist. For example, it is hard for women to choose jobs just because they are women. Also they receive fewer wages than men. This problem is difficult to solve quickly, so for a start, we have to change our recognition and some fixed ideas of gender."
10267,I think it is very influential that Justin said about feminism because he is famous so lots of people around the world hear it and think about it. There are not so many people who are feminists in Japan. Therefore we should think about it and I hope everyone in the world live comfortably.
10268,We have thought that men should work outside and women should do housework at home. But now the value is changing. We began to do action to be equal. So I think we shouldn't have bias to men or women.
10269,I agree with you. We shouldn't have different views between men and women. So we should make the society women can work as well as men.
10270,"I don't really agree with Trudeau, because it means forcing the children adult's ideas. It's true that there is still a lot of cases that women are treated worse than men, but recently there is some cases that men are treated worse than women. It's called the reverse discrimination. The ones who are usually thought to be weaker become much stronger because of the reverse discrimination. We really have to think about the problem carefully."
10271,"I have never think about feminism before the class. In our country, it is still many problems when women work in the company. We should spread the idea of feminism."
10272,"I feel favorable impression against Justin's opinion. As he said, I think thought like feminism should way to attain ends. I feel there are many people who see thought itself as purpose that should attain."
10273,I think this problem is difficult and serious but I support feminism.I think sexual discrimination is still left in our country.The idea of feminism should be spread a day sooner.
10274,I agree what he is saying on the whole. We should accept various personality without gender. However I think what he said will lead to force to his son's lifestyle. Anyway we need to more understand about feminism.
10275,Have you ever read 'Factory Ship'? it was written by Takiji Kobayasi and it depict harsh labor environment . It represents Japanese true state in stowaway era to some extent.So I think this news is very similar to this narrative. It is clear that the might of employer is much stronger than that of employee . So the government should strengthen its audit so that employees can work without suffering
10276,"In my perspective, Canada will play a crucial role as the country that leads the people in the world to have same rights amongst men and women. Recently, Donald Trump declared discrimination against women. Thus, instead of America, Canada should lead the world in terms of feminism."
10277,"I agree with your opinion that the feminism will correct discrimination even though it is a little difference. Furthermore, I suppose that no matter if we are feminism or not, it is crucial for everyone to pay attention to this kind of discrimination and cope with it carefully."
10278,"Mr.Trudeau describes himself as a feminist. But he didn't describe what feminist is . Are they activists who seek rising the status of women or only seek freedom (both are very abstract and maybe it is under discussion among people who call themselves as feminist.) A policy without construct plan will be target of criticism and will end in failure. And in the first place Japan and Canada and other developed country overcome the history in which women got disadvantage. Vote right are given both sex and the gap of salary between men and women are almost proved. So if women want to raise their status , I think what needed is not intervention of government but their effort (of course ,many predecessor did effort to raise their status such as Raichou Hiratuka in japan)"
10279,I agree with you. Physical and mental differences which between with men and women cannot be missed. Treating them in different ways cannot be called unjust.
10280,"I support Trudeau's feminist policy. To surprise, he appointed a cabinet with an equal number of men and women. I think that his this thinking is very correct and he should penetrate his posture, because his attitude can have a good effect to the leaders of the world including President Trump,"
10281,"'Raise boys as feminists to change 'culture of sexism'', Justin Trudeau has raised an interesting idea. To some degree, I think this idea is reasonable. Thus, I agree with what he said partly. However, I think treating men and women totally equally is unjust. There are many differences between men and women such as power and ways of thinking. 'What does the people called 'feminists' really want' is a question which is quite important."
10282,"i didn't think about sexism. because in japan this problem is latency. so nobody discuss about this seriously. but i feel the strong pressure to being man, for example my mother used to say to me 'do not cry , because you are the boy' . everyone may feel like this. so we should aim the equal society."
10283,"I think it is important that both sex have equality towards every aspect. However, in my feeling, it is better that we should not think too much about it. We should never forget the aim of gender equality. Sometimes things can go smoothly by men's leader or woman leader. In reality, it is almost impossible to treat men and women completely equal."
10284,"i agree your opinion. i thought feminist and feminism is not good. but after reading this headline, my images was changed. i want to be feminist!!!!"
10285,I have never thought this problem before reading this article. But I think his opinion is good and correct. So I want to be a feminist and introduce his opinion to others.
10286,I agree with you. My mother used to say such a things to me. So I want the equal society too.
10287,"It has been feared that most of the jobs are under threat of being replaced by AI. Even the occupations that have been viewed as prestigious, such as doctors are. It is true that technology makes our lives convenient. However, I don't think that AI is eligible for taking care of patients. That is because AI cannot sympathy. What if a patient has a terminal cancer? What AI can do is to tell him the hard truth. So the humans with warm hearts are still important."
10288,"The death of the employee who worked for Dentsu had attracted attention in Japan. However, this is a tiny part of Karoshi. I believe that much more deaths are caused by harsh labor environment and most of them are not known. Most of films hide the deaths of their employees because they will ruin the image of the companies. What is needed is the environment that employees can speak out and ask for the better work systems. Every people have to take actions and to insist on human rights."
10289,"I agree with you , women and man should be treated equally. We should change the stereotype ."
10290,"I agree with the idea of KN, especially the comment of 'Why else would he bother with the constitution, especially when there are more pressing issues such as the economy and ageing society?'. Certainly, diplomatic problem is big issue for Japan in terms of economy, but there are a lot of problems which are far more serious for future of Japan. Those will be burden of us, next generations. We are related to these problems especially, so I want Abe to cope with such situations first."
10291,"In recently election, I voted Liberal Democratic Party. However I am not the supporter of Constitutional change. And I disagree with the right to collective self-defence exercise. But this is the reason why I voted is there are no choice except it. So I think other parties such as Democratic Party and Hope and the Party didn't carry play their role. And Opposition parties are very important to achieve the goal of real democracy. Thus I want them to fulfill their duty of politics."
10292,"I partially agree with the opinion of JK. Prime Minister Abe has been criticized by a lot of people recently, but in the end he will win the recent election.Thus I think there is a high possibility Prime Minister Abe will succeed in constitutional revision, as JK said. In addition, another thing that I have to say is that we should deeply understand the constitution and the condition in Japan. If we could do this, we wouldn't be deluded by Abe's 'massive PR campaign' to persuade the public to back the constitutional revision. Therefore, in order to make the right decision, we have to know right information."
10293,"I agree with you. In the past, there are a lot of prejudices based on our gender, but the idea is changing now. Each one has each personality, so these diversities should be accepted and respected."
10294,"I agree with Justin Trudeau. I also believe we,our generation, will have to change the culture of sexism. I think his actions which aim at abolishing sexism tradition is partly effective.That is why, I cannot understand response of Grégoire Trudeau's post. If Trudeau does not denounce Trump personally and his administration's misogyny, this does not lead the conclusion that he is lip service feminist."
10295,"I agree with KN and MH. 'Why else would he bother with the constitution, especially when there are more pressing issues such as the economy and ageing society?' This is true. There is many problems which is more important and prior. Adding to this,if he controls some problems,then I think he will have the chance to constitutional reform. In that time, a mature debate about constitutional reform is extremely important. However, in this election,'it's been largely sidetracked by ideological disagreements from both the left and right ' So I support both KN and MH."
10296,"In this election, I didn't expect that any opposition parties get more seats than the Democratic party. This is because they were divided into so many groups though they said something alike. To change and improve the Japanese politics, I think that the most urgent things is corporation between parties."
10297,"In the last election, the liberal party won the victory. And also,I agree with the idea of the liberal party such as the reform of constitution. However, it is a big problem that there are just a few parties and the voter turnout is low. It becomes a room to be attacked against legitimacy from media etc. Therefore, we have to consider this problem by ourselves."
10298,"I voted the last election. I think that there are many movings this elections like the establishment the party of Kibou. JO said that 'Yuriko Koike, again displayed her worst traits - an inability to take counsel and a penchant for secretive decision-making - that made a disaster out of the deal.' However, I think her action is irresponsibility ,but it is good for Japanese politic. It is because it gave impact to the Japanese too steady system of politic."
10299,"I agree with you. Canada should lead the world in terms of feminism. In Japan,there is the trend of the discrimination against women. Also, many women resign the activity in the society because of the marriage, rising children and so on. Therefore I think that Japanese society should change the trend."
10300,"I almost agree with Justin Trudeau. Among them, I strongly agree with what he said 'It's the knowledge that when we are all equal, all of us are more free.'. It is because this opinion involves not only the difference of gender but also color of skin, ages and be rich or poverty. If people have like this opinion, the world will be better."
10301,"Many Japanese people may think that Abe amend the constitution, but actually we decide it as citizens. I think Abe still does not vote for referendums because there is no prospect of getting a majority of votes in the referendum. If Abe lose in the referendum, his cabinet will resign entirely and the opportunity to amend the Constitution will not be obtained again. Since this is an important issue, I think that it is necessary to deepen the public's understanding."
10302,"The party ob Kibou lost the election in the past. The reason is the absence of Prime Minister candidate because Yuriko Koike does not participate in the election. As said that it will be responsible for the administration, I think that it is easier for the public to vote by clearly indicating who will be the prime minister."
10303,"I agree with your opinion. I also think if Abe lose in the referendum, there's no people or parties who can lead Japan to favorable courses."
10304,I agree with you. It is so difficult to treat every person 'equal'. To understand the position not only of myself but also of others is the urgent thing for us to realize the equal society.
10305,"I agree with you. Japanese often think that just 'WORKING' is good, but it's bad not only for ourselves but also for the company and society. Changing the way we work is needed in Japan."
10306,"I disagree with you. This is because I think AI and we human can live together. I understand your fear for outperforming by AI. However, technology is improving everyday, so I think it's possible to treat AI by our hands."
10307,"I agree with Terudeau's opinion that boys have to be risen as feminists. I think that discriminations and unequal treatments towards women won't get better unless men support the idea of Feminist. The situation won't change even if all women are feminists, because the rest of the population is men and they are still influential.The idea of Feminism would be more persuasiveness if men supports it. None of us are inferior to others."
10308,"Recently,with the rapid development of AI, our life become extremely useful. At the same time we think that we forget 'hardship' 'effort'. As human brains evolve, I think that AI will also change at a speed that we can not understand. I hope that pursuit of convenience will not break the future."
10309,"I think that the worst political problem in our country is the low voting rate. In the previous House of Representatives election, the Liberal Democratic Party won. However, can it be said that it is the opinion of all the Japanese people? I believe that education for elections should be strengthened now that voting rights have been raised to over 18."
10310,"I can't understand why prime minister Abe won the election again.It is fourth for him to become prime minister.I think he done some political action forcefully last term for example,changing of the meanings of the constitution without understanding of residence.regardless of these truth, he became prime minister in this election. I wonder the election system reflect on our opinion ."
10311,"I think so too, in other words, the actions of Ms Koike impacts the situation of Japan's election.In addition to this, she indicated evolve of women as she say."
10312,"I agree with you. I think most of supporter of Abe are just looking at one side of his policy. Advocates of constitutional amendment often insist we have to save the our country by making an army. That opinion seems to be correct at first glance, but their opinion is based on one sided premise. They don't assume if deterrent of army don't work. What we need is calm judgment."
10313,"Well , as a foreigner , If i was Japanese I will support Abe . Although democracy is important in Japan and western countries, economic growth is also very important. Now Japan is facing increasingly competitive international environment , at this time Japan need a strong leader to lead them . If not , policies would not be longstanding , which means the efficiency must declines. But during the increasingly competitive world , efficiency and long term project are very significant."
10314,"I can't understand why Abe wants to try to change the constitution Article 9.Of course Abe has a mind of his own.In addition,actually Abe won the election.However,I can't agree with Abe's idea and support his administration by all means because even if it is said that war was not accepted by having amended constitution Article 9, security to never get up disappears.I think Abe should listen to more people's voice."
10315,I agree with your opinion.I unconvinced the election system of our country because the first party little change and mind
10316,"Sorry,I have sent in the middle. I agree with your opinion.I unconvinced the election system of our country because the first party little change and minority opinion not reflected."
10317,"I think the pacifist Article 9 remain untouched ,too. The reason is the constitution is not reformed since it was enforced and to reform the constitution is difficult for Abe's cabinet. I want for government to make a world which is friendly to foreign countries.So, the government should not provoke foreign countries unnecessarily."
10318,"I agree with your opinion that Abe should not reform the constitution Article 9. Surely Abe won the election, but if the opponents of Abe's cabinet increased , it would be dismantled.So,Abe should be listen to many people's voice."
10319,"Death from overwork is serious problem in japan. In general, people think that overtime can't produce good impact. However,I think overtime is not necessarily bad.Because there are problem which can't be solve without overtime . It is bad thin to force overtime ,but I think that you should avoid avoiding overtime work naturally."
10320,"I think that treating woman is very important in Japan. However ,I think that promoting women's activities and preferential treatment for women are different. In Japan, Sometimes it is treated as reverse discrimination to be gentle with people of a particular position. I want to think carefully because this problem is very delicate."
10321,"I think the Japanese consciousness concerning politics is lower than in other countries. The impact of the recent election of the House of Representatives dissolution on the future of Japan should be very large. However, the voting rate was low again this time. It is easy to complain, but I think that nothing will be conveyed unless you express your intention through voting."
10322,"I partly agree with the first Japan expert, associate professor MH. In his argument, he said ' It's not realistic to keep it in the current environment, with Chinese ambitions and uncertainty over the US's willingness to continue contributing to regional security in the way it has done before.' These days China has shown a great power to the world. Its growth of the economy and technology is remarkable, and some people say that they are planning to take control of the pacific. However, I think we should not easily change the constitution since it has a great power."
10323,"I don't really know if the government is trying to provoke foreign countries, but I agree with you that the pacifist Article 9 will remain untouched for a while. There are still certain number of people that disagree on changing the constitution, and it seems like it will not be smoothly changed."
10324,i think Japanese constitution will not be changed significantly. because i think the peace is the most important thing. the fact exists what the changing constitution increase the risk of war. but i think that no parties expected liberal democratic party can lead japan. the only thing i can do is to wager minister Abe same JK.
10325,"Almost of them insist that the constitutional revision was a key of the election. I agree with this insistence. But I think it is not good to vote considering just about it. That is to say, it is important to think this election from a various points of view. As for this election, the lack of interest in politics also drew the attention. We do have the right to vote. Even if a vote has little influence, I think we have to participate in politics as a member of this country."
10326,"As a student of faculty of political science, I am intrigued by these opinions. In my perspective, the most controversial point of the election is the revision of the constitute. In order to elect the appropriate candidate, people have to know or understand correct information and knowledge concerning constitution."
10327,"Abe won in election totally. However, I think we should maintain constitution Article 9 untouched. I suppose a lot of Japanese hold the same idea with mine. Abe may think if he should reform constitution Article 9, too. Because if he do that, foreign leaders will regard this as a signal that Japan will give up the policy of giving up the right of war and keeping peace."
10328,"I partly agree with what you said. As we treating the peace as the most important thing, Abe also know the importance of maintaining peace. Thus, Japanese constitution will not be reformed in a while. However, I wonder the reason that you claim that only liberal democratic party can lead Japan."
10329,I agree with your opinion. Abe have made many problems on his private. And he doesn't have the idea for improvements. So his posture makes the world think that Japan is not positive to solve problems.
10330,I think that Article 9 of the Constitution should be changed slightly. because the world has changed and it is an anachronism. And I would like to vote next time after thinking more about various things.
10331,i agree your opinion!!!!!!!!!!! i was very surprised that opposition parties get the seat of diet. so i think that the significant movement of changing constitution will stop. i want to expect japan's future!!!!!!!!!!!
10332,"I agree with you.I think the party of the Kibou ends in failure and the result of the election proves it. I think the reason why they're beaten is the Prime minister of the party Kibou, Yuriko Koike's behavior was irresponsible."
10333,"I think the party of the Kibou ends in failure and the result of the election proves it. I think the reason why they're beaten is the Prime minister of the party Kibou, Yuriko Koike's behavior was irresponsible. I thought Prime minister is the representative of the party and if he or she was irresponsible, the result will be bad. This is the natural thing but I can't understand why she took like this action."
10334,We should consider this problem seriously to develop our country. Japan and some of developed countries need women's power because they lack labor forces and the number of children. So people or at least politicians need to be feminist and make new policy which enables women to work as same as men like providing more nursery school.
10335,"I didn't think like you, but I was impressed with your opinion. As you said, I don't know the correct definition of feminist, too. We should not attack other people who don't agree with us, because feminism must be originally aimed for equality and freedom."
10336,Maybe nobody really knows if the government is trying to provoke foreign countries.So I want to decrease the possibility to fight against other countries.
10337,"The election was held last month and LDP won again. But I think people don't seem to vote from their real feelings. That means, they haven't had no choice but to vote LDP because the couldn't decide which party should they vote. I think there are no party which fulfill people's hopes actually. In this article, Abe said 'Now we are facing the test of how we can live up to the public's expectations.' Now is the time to do it."
10338,I think this new law is a good idea to protect from falling sales in music industry in Japan. But it seems difficult to crack down because the interaction is conducted below the surface. We need figure out some way to discover the action easily.
10339,"Maybe the transgender is really a financial burden on the military, but I do not think their minds and bodies and spirits are not whole or healthy,"
10340,"The system of Japanese party has somethings I can't understand. First of all, changing what we Japanese can make new party easily."
10341,I think one of the most important topic of the last election is article 9. I partially agreed with MH because many countries changed their constitution after WWⅡ. Japanese constitution has not changed more than 70 yeas while systems of society or economic conditions has improved a lot. However I also feel fear about changing our constitution. Article 9 has protected us from war during this 70 years. Now we should think about relationships worldwide but also think about the risk of our safe.
10342,I agree that people should understand more about the role of constitution and changing constitution. I thing we don't know enough about what would happen when the amendment of the article 9 passes.
10343,"I think Abe is a strong leader for Japan in the past 50 years . Abe may be , will bring Japan some positive affection . For example , Japanese inaugural rate is stable now which Abe brings to Japan."
10345,"I think so too. The AI became so convenient for our lives. It is so positive thing , but it has negative impact too. If AI grow up, the advance may rob our works. So we should consider negative sides to AI."
10346,"When I first read this article, I was confused by the detailed meaning of feminist. If Trudeau think feminist as the people who think deeply about women's rights and gender equality, I think that is no problem, but rather nice. However, When I hear the word FEMINIST I think up the people who scream the superiority of women rampantly. I don't know well I have normal knowledge of feminist, but anyway achievement of gender equality must be done."
10347,"Climate change is a problem for all people. So all countries should do anything for it, for example, reducing CO2 emissions. But to deal with natural disasters is very difficult for people. I think first of all we should do preparation for them. In order to do that, all countries have to be rich, although this is too difficult."
10348,"I partly agree with you . I think peace is the most important thing every country. Although Abe want to change the constitution now , but this doesn't mean that Abe don't know the importance of peace ."
10349,"I agree with most of your idea. We are having same constitution from more than 70 years ago. World has changed , it won't fit our society anymore. Although it's hard to change constitution. Like article 9 is one of the most important article for Japanese and I think many people don't want to change it. And I don't have strong feeling for changing this. But, I think this article never save us from war. Because this article doesn't have power to stop other countries. We hadn't had any war because we were lucky not because we had this constitution."
10350,"I guess the reason why Abe won this election is that we have bad image for other political parties. And most people are thinking that most people vote for LDP, so do I. The way he does is actually forceful. Although i think we need to change many things including constitution."
10351,"Actually , I read some related news before . Indeed , Japanese women are facing a lot of pressures , comes from gender inequality . Now due to the declination of economic growth , Japanese women need to work and also need to take care of babies . So I think we need pay more attention to women , and give them more political , social support .For example , during leisure time , man can help them take care of babies . And government should build more nursery ."
10352,I like your sentence that 'none of us are inferior to others'. I agree that equal treatments for men and women can achieve when both men and women try hard.
10353,"I agree that we should change the atmosphere of working. To achieve that, not only companies also workers should change the idea for working. Companies also should pay attention for workers' health condition."
10354,"I couldn't understand the meaning of the title at first sight. But now I get that means people can erase the information they don't want to be in public. I think this is a great idea. Because our privacy information seem to outflow easily and it damages us in many ways. Technologies make us feel comfort, but sometimes we have to consider how should we deal with them."
10355,"I remember I felt resentment to hear this news. Because I didn't understand how he could act so selfishly at that time. According to this passage, the accidents which one man cause many people's death are increasing. I think so too. In this time, we should reconsider the preciousness of life."
10356,I agree with your opinion. Recently many problems cause in North Korea. This situation is all made by their government. So we should not criticize the people of North Korea.
10357,"If the Japanese government wanted to increase the number of women workers, it is essential to make a more comfortable working environment for working women. Though the gender equality is still not industrialised in Japan compared to other countries, I think it is time to change the old system. I hope we will be able to work in a society where people care more about the working women in the future."
10358,"I think we absolutely treat transgender evenly with who is not transgender.that's because think to admitting the existence of them does not influence on our everyday life.there is no harm,so we should have hearts which filled with love."
10359,"I think the problem is whether the Japanese government need women to work. I know some women have no choice that they have to work. Then, the government have to make a more comfortable environment for working women. Maybe the men can help women for taking care of babies more just like what Swedish men do."
10360,I was impressed with your opinion. I didn't think that if owners are twin. Of course Apple's technology is sophisticated but these kind of case will occur in the future.
10361,"it is very difficult problem.Though bringing child to work place seems good idea, we can't have bad inference by doing ,but it promotes women to work outside the house.so we have to find other way ."
10362,"In my opinion, the behavior this woman took was wrong. Actually, I know that she took her son to a city assembly because she thought it was the best way to show how difficult it is to raise children in Japan. However, for me, it is unacceptable to work with one's child because in that situation, it is difficult to draw a line between public and private. I don't think this is the best way to improve working situations for women."
10363,I disagree with you. It is because that Nikkei news paper said ' from 40s to 50s men have the highest risk of karoshi.'. I think there is no relation between women don't get used to work and karoshi.
10364,"It is the symbol of one of the biggest problem and worst tradition of Japan.I watched the TV news said Japanese worker are not efficient among developed countries. Japanese tend to think long working is good, but that is a lie. We should find the way to work more efficiently."
10365,"I agree with you. I never work in The black companies ad also I can't understand we are rated by long working. Adding your opinion, I think we should feel rewarding by working,"
10366,"I agree with you. When I went to France, super markets are closed at 3 pm. Moreover, in France, workers have to take leisure 3 weeks together at once. Many French can work on their pass. In Japan, I think It is impossible. I believe that we should install these ways of thinking to work."
10367,"When I saw the title of this news first, I couldn't understand the meaning.I didn't think AI is developing incredibly like that. Now we control AI correctly., but I am so scared the situation that AI will be out of our hands. We often saw the movie that the robots attack us. If it will come true, that is terrible. I hope the technology of AI will be improved in positive way."
10368,"I understand you. I think in the same way. There are both merits and demerits of life with AI. I'm so excited how AI technology will be developed in the future, but at the same time, I think that we should accept them more seriously."
10369,"I knew that Japanese mothers are in serious situation. The number of kindergartens are less than that of needed. In many companies, the facility of pregnant women and mothers. I think Ms. Ogata take an action to reveal these terrible situations for Japanese society and world. I don't know she really wanted to take his son to congress everyday, but it had an impact as demonstration. Japanese government should accept this problem more seriously, and study the situation in other countries and learn them. I hope when I become a mother, this awful situation will be changed."
10370,"The pacifist Article 9 should be changed. Japanese constitution was established about 70 years ago, and ever since, it have never been changed at all. It doesn't much the current situation in which Japan is put. The situation is completely different from that one in which Japanese was put in when the constitution was enacted."
10371,I agree with your opinion. I also think that Japanese can be more free to take a rest.
10372,"I feel sorry for the baby because he was used as a tool. It's a pity that feminists,who think they are protecting women's rights, often paradoxically degrading women."
10373,"I was surprised when I first read this article. That is because the lawmakers who brought the baby were doing the correct writing of articles. But that is wrong. Even though acting with a desire to change the environment, it will be selfish if the way is wrong."
10374,"Recently not only men but also women work. But treatment is different for men and women and there is discrimination in work standards. Japanese government should make work place where women are easy to work. For example women can take child care leave and after giving birth to a baby, women can be back to former post."
10375,"I think hurricanes are natural disasters. However, these hurricanes were not ordinary. Then, we should stop the climate change."
10376,"I think we have to take action to stop climate change. In this year, I think the fall was too short. It was the one of serious climate change. Japanese fall is very beautiful. There are red leaves, autumn sadness and so on. For protecting our culture and nature, we must do that."
10377,"In Japan, the word 'feminist' is more radical than the meaning Mr. Trudeau defines, so when I first read this story, I was very surprised. Personally, I don't like feminists in Japan because they emphasize the equality of gender too much and sometimes I feel like they insist that women are more superior than men. However, 'feminists' by Mr. Trudeau are much more familiar with me and I can accept feminists' idea."
10378,"I agree with you. We should know that we are very lucky that we can play sports and have rights to study. Sometimes, we easily forget that we are lucky and hope more than what we need."
10379,"I feel that what North Korea is doing now is like what Japan did around WW2. Japan lost the war and many Japanese died because of the uncontrollable behavior of authorities. If the current situation related to North Korea continues, it will fall down to the situation similar to Japan experienced. Therefore, Japan has the obligation to stop North Korea cooperating with other countries."
10380,"I think refugee problem is one of the most important problem. In these days,there are a lot of refugees who don't have any sin.regardless of this truth,japan welcomes only a little.it is truth that there is some terrible things when we welcome a certain number of refugees,but we have to cooperate now."
10381,"Mr. Trump has to announce changing his policy with more responsibility including on Twitter. According to this article, there is a possibility that Mr. Trump announced that to distract people's interest from other issues like Russian investigation. If it's true, it might work well. However, his announcement hurt many people and he has to withdraw at least his discriminatory statements."
10382,I think so too. There are many things that we don't know about our universe. I strongly believe this discovery helps scientists find new facts related to the origin of the universe.
10383,"I think that her decision would lead to a diplomatic problem. Japan and Korea are in bad relationship at some point, and this incident might worsen the relationship. Since North Korea comes to be a big problem, Japan and South Korea should build good relationship."
10384,I agree with your idea. I think the gender equality is still not reflected in Japan compared to foreign countries too. Japan should make place where all people work with ease. I want the government to lead the Japanese when it comes to hiring women.
10385,"I think that the technology is convenient, but we have to treat it very carefully. In this article, GARVIE said that when the technology becomes normalized, we will treat it without attention. Then, it is the our crisis. To protect our private information, I think we should have more knowledge about technology and danger ."
10386,"I agree with you. I think that we should think before we press the send button to the SNS. Now, If I said something without thinking on SNS, some people think ' it is your opinion,'. Then, sometimes I am criticized by using terrible words. Therefore, there may be the social trouble."
10387,"I partly agree with you. I see your point that Ms. Koike does not have responsible for her behavior. However, she will continue to make efforts to improve the administration of Tokyo as a president of the party Kibou. That is the responsibility which Ms.Koike has as the president."
10388,"I have heard that the word 'karoshi' comes to be understood in English. This means that the Japanese working culture that people work longer than fixed time is very infamous all over the world. It is difficult for us to improve this situation because the number of working people will decrease in the future. However, we have to solve this serious problem to make the society better."
10389,"I agree with you in that there is a possibility that people will be governed by machines. I know that AI is very useful and makes our lives convenient. But, if AI advancements continue and come to govern people, what should we do? Until we get the answer to this difficult question, we have choices to stop developing AI technologies."
10390,"In modern society, the way of working is diversified. It is important to develop a flexible system and create a social environment that considers each gender and fortune. In this case, it was not necessary to prohibit it because it was decided though it was not so if this child cried loudly or did the thing which disturbed the progress of the Assembly yet."
10391,"I evaluate the Abe administration. So far, none of the administrations were half-hearted and very dependable. Compared to that, the Abe administration has long survived, and the main policy, Abenomics has greatly improved the economy of Japan. It is necessary to leave it to someone to a certain extent to decide and to execute something."
10392,"Freedom of who you love is ensured by many as the basic human rights prescribed by the Constitution. In today's society, the current state of humanity and the trend of society are changing. The people of the sexual minorities are living in agony of not being understood by themselves. The shape of happiness is each person, and it is not the one that someone presses it, and it is not the one that the law is as prescribed."
10393,"There should not be a loss of human life for the benefit of the company or the organization. It is outrageous that it happens in NHK. Each person is free to work, but there is no more important work than a life. It is necessary to develop a system where everyone can work without a doubt and create an atmosphere."
10394,This is a very difficult and difficult problem for Japanese people . Japanese people have strict eyes so a lot of mothers tend to feel not free . I think we have to have more free eyes little by little .
10395,"What is human dignity? Now, human life and technology can't cut it. . The evolution of AI is terrific, and many professions are making AI. However, there are still many important things that only human beings can do. What is important is the living of both. It is important to use the power of AI and the things that humans do politely."
10396,The Mysteries of the universe are often not yet elucidated. Their discoveries were a big step toward approaching the mysteries of the universe. This discovery may lead to the development of the time machine though it might still be a little early.It is a strange feeling to think that this earth where I live is only a tiny star if I see it in the universe.
10397,"Thoughtless irresponsible behavior is from as the one responsible for a country's administration wants. However, it should be treated as something different from this and other policies. I think the Abe administration deserves an assessment even if he sees that its survival and long-Japan economy is on its way to recovery."
10398,"This is a hard problem. it's obviously happening to stop the flow of a parliament if we admit bringing a baby in assembly hall. And now the right of women in society was insisted strongly. So we rapidly need to take some solutions. Especially in Japan, it's difficult for woman to be a middle manager. We should recognize this situation of Japan."
10399,"I am afraid that AI replaces all human beings as the AI technology develops. I know that there is an opinion that developed technologies allow people to co-exist with AI. However, AI is a kind of machines and thinks by itself. Its developing speed is enormous, and will overtake human beings."
10400,"According to this news, MH says the Article 9 is now something of an anachronism. Abe administration also think the Article 9 should be changed. I can't agree to this idea. Of course I know, there are some problems with neighboring countries recently. However, I think that more dangerous problems may happen if Japan amend the Article 9. We should think about this issue more seriously."
10401,"I agree with you. Certainly, the world has been changed a lot. However, I think it important that we consider this issue which we should really reform the constitution,especially the Article 9."
10402,"These days, technology is more and more developing. I worry that AI will replace human in many aspects. Though AI makes our lives more convenient, we should not rely on AI too much because human beings have own warmth which AI cannot have."
10403,"I agree with you. I think if high technology improves considerably, human beings may be overwhelmed by AI. I hope human beings can use AI effectively."
10404,"When I saw this news on TV, I was very shocked. I regret that a young woman passed away. I have not thought that such a big company contravenes working rules and gives large burdens to employees. I suppose that the government should check the working condition of all companies in Japan as soon as possible. I hope that any sad incident like this will never happen."
10405,"This incident may clear one of the current situation in Japan which working women face difficulty. I wonder Ms Ogata is not right because her action may surprise other members of parliament and a baby has a possibility of disturbing the smooth progress of the council. However, I feel she gave us a so strong impression of the problem. I consider the government needs to increase the number of nurseries and to support working women more."
10406,"I can't understand why did the woman with her baby have to leave chamber. Though there is a fear that the conference might be disturbed, I think women have the right to raise their children up everywhere. In this situation, 'womenomics' seems to be difficult to conduct. So it is important to change our mind and go into the feeling of the people who have a baby."
10407,"I understand how hard mothers are. she has sent letter to get permit to bring her baby before this council have held, and it was not permitted. I think at that time she should have stop trying to bring baby. I don't think that baby can be a observer, but as long as that baby was quite at first, he might cry later. also that place wont be comfortable place for the baby. She was warned by the council. I think it is not a problem because, by her action, the assembly was delayed. Any way, i hope japan will be the comfortable place for everyone including those working mothers. we have so many problems like not having enough kindergarten and also teachers. we have to spent more money for those."
10408,"I understand your opinion. although I disagree with bringing baby to the camber. it wont be the great place for the baby, and even he is silent, others will have to take attention for him. It will be stressful for others and I think the works wont go smoothly. I cheer those working mothers and hope they going to have a better life in the future."
10409,I have never think like that about this problem but I think that is also true. He is used as tool. and I agree with your opinion too.
10410,"they are still launching rockets these days. actually these days are much worse than before. I fear that North Korea might start war in the future with US, Japan and south Korea. I am thinking that Trump can build quite good relationship with Kim, because they seems similar. I hope the relationship will be better in the future."
10411,I think this is a true and big problem. and I am the one who are not good at Kanji. although we know kanji is important we don't really have chance to use them. these days we just type on gadgets. We don't really have to know how to write and order of writing those. what we have to know is how to read and what Kanji we use on the each situation.
10412,I think so too. I suppose that many working women hope that Japanese government will take some measures to back up them.
10413,"I think it is important to realize the equality between men and women. I suppose that as he is a feminist, Justin Trudeau has a responsibility to solve the problem about women in Canada. There may be many people who pay attention to how Canada will be changed by his feminist policies."
10414,I think so too. There is the inequality between men and women not only in Canada but also in Japan. Japanese people should also consider the gender gap problems more seriously. Trudeau's idea may be useful to make Japan better.
10415,I hope that these new economic sanctions are effective to stop North Korea's dangerous actions. I think having armaments against North Korea is not good because it will run the risk of more serious conflict. It is necessary to solve this problem safely.
10416,"I think the city assembly has old thinking. SI they have no logical reason why they don't allow that case. But I think it is should not allowed to attend the assembly with one's baby. Because mother and other assembly people can't concentrate the assembly session, if there is a baby. Both working and taking care of a baby are important. But baby is more important than working for mother. So mother concentrate taking care of baby and can't concentrate the assembly. In addition, other people can't concentrate the assembly if mother takes care of a baby in the assembly. The assembly is most important job of politicians. So they should concentrate the assembly. In this way, I think baby in the assembly should not be allowed. I"
10417,I think to creating the environment which the women work easily is very important thing. And it brings good effect not only for companies but also for whole of society. However I agree with the act of the women politician did. Because it could be seen as the performance. Moreover the act prevented the progress of the meeting. So it can not be allowed and must be criticized not only to the politician but also to feminism that is. Therefore I disagree with the act but I support feminism of course.
10418,"I agree with your opinion. Because the woman politician's performance prevented the progress of conference and it couldn't be allowed. However I think to be the better working situation for woman who has the children. Therefore I think the action is wrong, but I support feminism."
10419,"I heard this news before the class. Because it was frequently broadcast on TV news. And when I watched it, I was so interested. And I think the biggest factor of the KAROSHI problem is Japanese working culture. There are the culture ' working longer is better thing' This bad thinking caused the long working hour. I wonder why the government promote to reform the Japanese terrible working situation."
10420,I strongly agree with your opinion. Because I wonder why the terrible working situations are reformed. And I think government should promote the changing the bad working culture that ' working longer is better' .
10421,"When I heard this news, I thought what a convenient facility it was! at the first time. However the new dangerous which people cannot expected are hidden in new technology such as privacy problems and so on. So I think we have to take carefully when we use smartphones and other digital devices."
10422,"I think that the working environment of women is a problem to be discussed in today's society.I think that how to catch child care leave is still a stereotype.Regardless of whether it is a good method, Mr. Ogata was able to tell the problem of Japanese society now."
10423,I agree with your opinion. I think that this act gave the opportunity to rethink the current women's labor in Japanese society. But I do not know if her way is better.
10424,"By reading this article, I began to think that it is important for people to understand Japanese politics well.I think that each citizen interests in politics and if it can make a proper judgment it will proceed in a good direction. I think that the correct way of catching democracy is this."
10425,"I disagree with you.That's because the climate changes was caused by our action.It is true that it is hard for us to control them, but we must have some responsibility to protect the nature."
10426,"I agree with you. I think there are some good points and bad points of SNS as you. considering this truth, it is important for us to think of the way of using.What we can get from SNS depends on it."
10427,I agree with your opinion. I think that it is not a smart politician but a wise citizen that comes to be important in Japanese politics.
10428,"I think that the way of thinking of feminism is important, but I think that over thinking is not good. In recent years I feel as if some people despise men by mistaking the meaning of feminism. Since the idea of ​​feminism has not penetrated into Japan yet, I think that it is important for many people to understand feminism correctly from now on."
10429,"I think AI has a part of better than our brains for example, simple tasks such as computational power. AI cannot read emotion of people so I don't think AI will be governed us."
10430,I think that it is good for women that men spread feminism ideas. I think that the idea of ​​feminism will become necessary for society of the future.
10431,"I think karoshi is a serious problem in Japan.In addition to this class there were some classes that focused karoshi. In Japan, more than one person is dead per day by karoshi. I think the government should try to solve this problem."
10432,I think the way of thinking about labor is problematic in Japan compared with other countries.Certainly there is data that it is correlated with having money and happiness.But I think that happiness will not be born from money resulting from working too much.I think that it is important to refer to other countries and think about new ways of working.
10433,"As I read your opinion, it certainly came to my mind that there are many things that are not taken up in the news in Japan.I hope many people will be saved with this news."
10434,I agree with Trudeau's opinion. As the number of people who have the idea of feminism increases it gets closer to gender equality. I think it is important to educate such as Trudeau.
10435,"Hurricane has little interest in Japan, so I got interested. Moreover, I was amazed at the progress of the current science and technology. It may be possible for damage caused by natural disasters to disappear."
10436,It seems that global warming can be stopped if technology advances. I hope that few people will feel harsh in natural disasters.
10437,I could not understand President Cardin 's idea. Why is it that you can not enter the army because it is a transgender? Tramp President is often talked about SNS too. People who support him are steadily declining and I am anxious.
10438,I think Ms Ogata's action was wrong but we know that there are not enough places that mothers can leave their children. Many people who are in the same situation may sympathize with her action. Her action was wrong but it posed a problem as a representative of mothers who are in the same situation.
10439,Social media has a strong influence so how to use it is very important. It has not only positive sides but also negative sides. We shouldn't write as encouraging discrimination.
10440,"I understood how working mother have trouble in Japanese society, and I think this problem should be solved as soon as possible. Even though this is a really difficult and also important problem, I do not think what Ms. Ogata has done was a good idea. I believe she had to concentrate on her work when she was in city assembly session."
10441,"According to this article, this hurricane occurred because of the influence of global warming. Global warming is have an big effect of our life but we don't feel danger closer to us in Japan. I think we have no sense of crisis."
10442,I agree with you opinion. I believe that we should realize how election result effects our lives and how important the voting is.
10443,I also think feminism is aim for gender equality. I believe now is just a halfway through for the equality.
10444,"I completely agree with Trudeau. We, people over the world should aim for the gender equality. I hope by his action, the world would move and realize how important the equality is. I really respect him."
10445,I also think Japanese people often think working longer is a good work. I do not think this is a good tradition and way of thinking. We should more focus on the quality of the work.
10446,"I really agree with you. The word Karoshi is spread all over the world, and it means the problem in Japan really represents the word Karoshi."
10447,I think so too. AI is very convenient but we have to control for safety .
10448,I agree with you.Japan is the country with the world's most karoshi. More than one person is dead per day by karoshi. This is a problem that needs to be solved as soon as possible.
10449,I think that as the number of feminists increases it gets closer to gender equality. Of course we have rights to think freely but I want many people to think feminism .
10450,I think so too. I hope that all people can work without effect of raising children.
10451,"I agree with you. We don't have to discriminate anybody. Trump obviously discriminated transgender, he should not forgiven."
10452,"there are many people who have cosmetic surgery , but it tends to be seen like a bad thing.It is true that it is looks like they think light of their faces, but they can get power from have their face what they want."
10453,"I do not know whether her action that take the baby to the assembly was right or not.That is mainly because there must have been another way to watch her baby. However, I can agree with her statement the women in Japan have troubles keeping the balance between work and lives as mother. All Japanese have to consider this problem."
10454,"I proud Ms Ogata's decision to take her baby to the chamber. I don't think the way of her protest was the best way , but I still proud of her. According to the data , Japan remains one of the world's worst performing industrialised nations in terms of gender equality, so we should change this rule-bound society. Many congress members in Japan are spoiled , they talk, shout, and even sleep during the session. Their attitude is awful and I think her baby is a much better member of congress. Those who always try to find a fault of others should think carefully about themselves before talking , shouting , and criticizing others."
10455,That's right. We should consider AI again. AI has some merits and demerits. We tend to focus on only merits. But merit comes with demerit. So we should consider not only merits but also demerits.
10456,"The present Japan still has a strong sense of values and preconceived notions about old jobs and their forms. As you say, I think it is necessary to develop a flexible system that suits the times."
10457,"I think the religious and ethnically problem is very complex. In Japan, almost people do not believe into religions and people in Japan is almost Japanese. However, in the world there are some wars caused by religious and ethnically problems. If Aung San Suu Kyi can not protect citizens, we have to take action to save them."
10458,"This kind of problem is difficult to solve if we do not mind that much. To make the working situation in Japan better, we should know that of other countries."
10459,I agree with your idea. I feel that less Japanese are interested in our own country's politics than people in other countries. The low voter turnout show this bad situation. We should be more conscious of our own country.
10460,"I agree with you. The sanction have no effect on the North Korean leadership. Now, some wooden ships arrived at the coast of Japan. Also, in some of them, there were cadavers. I think we are faced the threaten of nuclear bombs. But, in North Korea, there are people who suffer from the North Korean leadership. Then, we have to take action to change North Korean leadership for saving North Korean people."
10461,"I partly disagree with you. I see your point that deeply believed idea can be religion. However, it is hard for me to recognize Mr.Trudeau's idea as religion. It is just an idea and we should respect one's own opinion and discuss it each other."
10462,I think growing number of elderly cause many problems.firstly it is said usually there will be shortage of money which helps us to live life .secondary the elderly regard their life as something meaningless.especially who work hard will be like that. So we have to think of what helps elderly mentally .
10463,"I can not agree with your opinion.Her action had important effect that have Japanese people think about the problem of women in Japan,even though her action did not comply with the rule of assembly."
10464,I can agree with your opinion. We have to come up with the way to deepen the public's understanding .
10465,I can agree with your opinion. We need to make the environment that every person respect each person's diversity.
10466,"I agree with your opinion that strong measures which promote changing the atmosphere of working have to taken.So, we have to discuss the way to solve this problem."
10467,"I can not agree with your opinion that we should refrain from using AI. Now, Japan will face many problem like aging society or the shortage of labour.We have to use the function of AI to overcome these problem.So we need to discuss the way to control AI."
10468,"I agree with your opinin.However, we should not get rid of the violent way.We can not imagine perfectly what Kim is going to do."
10469,"I think what Ms Ogata did is the good idea to attract people's attention on Japan's working problem. As we can see articles of it not only in Japanese but also in English, many people interested in this. Doing both raising up children and working is difficult, but I hope more people discuss about this."
10470,"I agree with you. I think what Ms Ogata did is the beat way to make this women's working problem widely known, but I respect her courage to have done such a difficult decision."
10471,"Actually, women in Japan must work due to the slump in economic growth. But there is no facility to help it, it is difficult to balance child-rearing and work. The country should set up a nursery school and make subsidies to families with children."
10472,"I agree with your opinion that AI may swallow our human lives and a lot of problem will occur. However, treating AI safely and accurately, I believe that it can be a good friend for us to make this world more convenient to live."
10473,"I disagree with your opinion. The opinion and the public opinion are easily influenced by the report, and it accelerates the mistake on the basis of democracy without noticing the wrong judgment at the time. It has historically proved that Hitler's Holocaust and Japan security laws. The power to watch the movement of the world from an objective, calm aspect is important without being misled by biased coverage."
10474,"I'm shocked every time I watch such news which can be said 'Toorima' in Japanese. Also I was taken aback to know why he has killed in the cruel way. It might be odd to say like this, but I think if he had wanted to die, he should have killed himself. Why did he involve unrelated people? I can't suppress my anger."
10475,"I voted for the LDP in recent elections. But because the politics of the LDP is wonderful, I did not vote. It is because other parties feel that they are too bad. Politics is done with opinions. Therefore, the power of the opposition party must be close to the ruling party. I hope that a new political system in Japan will be created."
10476,"I agree with your idea that 'the best way to solve refugees problems are solve their country's problems by themselves'. I think this idea is important for us, too. Japanese is more peaceful than developing countries like Afghanistan. Also, thanks to SNS that we can know the figure of news story easily, but we don't take action to solve these problems. What we should do right now is to express our opinions by our action."
10477,"I deeply concerned that the relationship with US and North Korea will be cut off. Both countries can give strong effects to other ones and Japan is located in the middle of these two countries. I don't know exactly what Japan can to solve this problem, but the last thing we should do is relying too much on US in economy."
10478,"I think that you should think about AI well, because AI has advantages and disadvantages. While our lives become more convenient by AI, our work is deprived by AI. It is not good to be too afraid of AI, but you should not be used without thinking carefully."
10479,"I think that you should think about AI well, because AI has advantages and disadvantages. While our lives become more convenient by AI, our work is deprived by AI. It is not good to be too afraid of AI, but you should not be used without thinking carefully."
10480,I think the man's action was ridiculous. Even a child won't do such a thing. Hadn't he been conscious of the value of the picture? But the administration system of the museum should also be criticized. I think the laxness of the checking procedure has has given rise to this accident. So the museum has to hasten the establishment of some measures.
10481,"Ms. Ogata's action was brave. It did attract attention and show the difficulty of working women facing. But I cannot praise her action from the bottom of my heart. That is because I doubt her sincerity towards her work. Her kids behaved well, but usually kids are not like that. Moreover, what if kids cried during the discussion? Should we stop the conference? I believe that there must have been better way to speak out for the working women."
10482,"I think so, too. But I think there are some jobs that only men can do and only women can do. So I think it's important to place the right person in the right place. That way, everyone can play active part."
10483,i think that AI will enrich our live. so AI will become as god. i expect the future!!! but i am afraid of AI's domination such as Terminator!!! so i want scientists to make very kind AI!!!!!
10484,i am scared to work in japan. i work part-time job at supermarket. my boss that is regular employee is working everyday. i cannot see when he take a holiday. i don't want to work like him!!! i expect the japan's working state will be better than now.
10485,"i agree you!!! Japanese work too much!!! i think it is necessary for Japanese to take more holiday. someone says 'if Japanese working time decrease, Japanese economy will get worse than now' i don't think. because in Germany people don't work long time but their economy is well. i think Japanese are only inefficiently!!!"
10486,"i think ms.ogata should not bring her baby. because the baby cannot be relaxed in chamber and her colleagues cannot concentrate the discussions. the object of chamber, to discuss smooth, cannot be achieved. but i think japan's child care environment is very bad. i want not to repeat like this news!"
10487,i agree you. this problem is too difficult. i understand both position. we should have warm eyes. that is the first move to prove this problem....
10488,"I really agree with K.N. and I support 'The constitution is the most divisive issue - it's like Brexit in the UK.' part the most. In this global society, the issue in Japan effects widely all over the world. Not only Abe and the government but we, Japanese should think about this issue so carefully."
10489,"I agree with your opinion. I have an experience living in the U.S. just like you, and I felt same thing. The American family who live next to my room seemed like that they are really enjoying their lives, and the parents came back to home much earlier than my father."
10490,"I agree with you. I think Japanese company should focus more on the quality of the job, not how long people work."
10491,"I do not think AI cannot be a god neither. I am interested in, if AI could be a god in the future, how it make a decision for us. I think AI and human should co-exist and make a better society too."
10492,"I agree with you. Ms Ogata's action called attention on the problem of women's working. Also, the assembly should consider about how to make the environment more family-friendly for mothers. If they do not consider, her action is no meaning. I think that it is good for Japanese society to make the environment more family-friendly foe mothers because women has the ability different from men. I believe that women's power will change the Japanese society."
10493,"I think so too. Technology is developing very well, but we have to recognize the technology is safe or not. We have to be more careful and sensitive to this kind of new technology."
10494,"I think that we should think about the style of child care and work. when I read this article, I can not judge her action is good or not. It is because I think this action can call attention on the environment of women's working and she confused public and private. However, in Japan, there is the fact that kindergarten is not satisfy and mothers have trouble. Then, it is clear that there are points that we have to change in the Japanese society like this. Therefore, I think we should think about the style of child care and work."
10495,This problem is related to historical issue of war. Each countries took many policy measures having their correctness. So their insistence certainly differ. We need to know each stance and compromise to some extent because current our relationship is the most important.
10496,"I thought Yuka Ogata's action was not appropriate at the conference, but it was very meaningful behavior to appeal to the society that it is a difficult thing that women work with the housework. It has a impact to take her baby to the conference, so her action surely has an effect."
10497,"I agree with you. When I know this story I was very surprised and I thought her action has a big impact, but it is not a suitable behavior in the conference. I thought there are another way to appeal the difficulty of the woman's working environment."
10498,"I partly agree with you. I think peace is the most important thing to protect in this world. But I think Abe's government is little selfish that you can see in the problem of Moritomo and so on. I don't know waist is the best way for Japan, but one thing I can say is to change the Japanese government is the most important thing to do now."
10499,I don't want to work in Japan now. Full-time employees in my office are planning to work both at Christmas and New Year. I think whether there is no way to work a little more efficiently.
10500,"I was so surprised about news. In this article,there is a possibility that people will be governed by machines. I think that AI is very useful and makes our lives better. But, if AI advancements continue and come to govern people, what should we do? About this topic,I discussed during my high school days.So, my conclusion ,as human being,is keeping watching how AI develop and if the situation will surely come true,we must destroy it."
10501,"I am against bringing a baby to parliament, because I think it strange to work while care about babies. We should focus more on discussion. It would be better to take a solution such as increasing the number of childcare facilities rather than bringing the baby to the parliament."
10502,I am disagree with your opinion. It only seems to be a performance that she brought her baby. I think that she should do a justice appeal.
10503,"I've thought if the government wanted to increase the number of women workers, it is essential to make a more comfortable working environment for working women. I think it is time to change the old system to cope with the new situation. However, I think Yuka Ogata's behavior should not be welcomed,let alone,from some perspective her actions must be criticized. However much you want to show the difficult situation surrounding working mother,I think using baby is not good way."
10504,"When I read this news I was so surprised. I think people should take a moment before they press the send button.' on the SNS represents my opinion. SNS easily cause misunderstandings and easily expand all over the world,and so it cause big problem when you notice.This is the point we have to pay attention."
10505,"In this article, the strange hurricanes were related to climate change such as global warming. It is easy to believe so. But, scientists are now claiming that global warming does not the main cause. Anyway, we are facing the big problem and we should think the measures to solve and protect our earth. In this context,we should more research and we should think deeper."
10506,"I think that people noticed that such famous companies forced employees to work overtime, which made people consider this working problem more seriously. I hope all companies review their working environments and reform them."
10507,"I think that using AI in correct way is good thing. We should learn how to use it but it has also danger. In these days, AI 'shougi' is the big news. It is not so far that AI will beat us in every games. I heard the news that Goldman Sachs New York headquarters has replaced 600 of its traders with 200 computer engineers. AI is very cleaver so we have to care about it."
10508,I think so too. We have to prevent AI's growing.
10509,I agree with your opinion. This is so important problem in Japan. Mr Ogata was able to tell tell this problem to us.
10510,I think Yuka Ogata was not right. She should keep her baby to babysitter or a nursery school because In Kumamoto there are enough babysitter or a nursery school. Chamber is the place where our representations talk in. Her action is brave and express womenomics but I think that is not the right way.
10511,"I think so too. In this world wide society, issue is necessary for us. We have to think about it carefully."
10512,I guess the reason why Abe won this election is partly because we had bad images against other political parties. The supporting rate of Abe administration had been decreasing before this election. I think it's important to know each political parties and shouldn't focus and criticize on only one policy.
10513,"I agree with you . Now Japanese women are facing more and more pressure , Japanese society and government should enact some laws to help them."
10514,"Hurricanes are unpopular in Japan, so at first, it was difficult for me to imagine what hurricanes are like. However, after I read this story, I found that how terrible the hurricane Irma was. If global warming lead to this situation, we have to make the earth's environment better."
10515,"I agree with you . Due to the shortage of labor recourse , now , Japanese women have to work and also need to take care of their babies . This is very difficult . Japanese women should be respected ."
10516,"I think Yuka Ogata should left her baby to childcare public places or nursery school. It's true that government has to improve the working environment for women. However, in this state, to bring their child to chamber is not allowed."
10517,"I think , America should negotiate with North Korea . Sanctions , may be , to some extent , useful. But , I do not think conflict will bring peace . Whether the sanctions made by America will be working is still unknown ."
10518,"I'm interested in this news when I see the list of headlines. The mystery of universe have always attracted attention. So this discovery doesn't only develop science but also advance a dream of humanity. Although it may take long time to use practical, I think we continue developing this study."
10519,"I agree with you . unconscious discrimination against woman in Japan more ,compared with other countries . Now woman is a important labor recourse in Japan , they should be respected , because they have done a lot contributions to Japan ."
10520,"The difficulties between the two countries are deep-rooted. The states specified North Korea as a terrorist-supporting nation recently. Trump also takes various sanctions to North Korea,however,they keep firm attitude against USA. I hope the relationship in East Asia improves in the near future."
10521,I think the recognition technology by face to unlock the devices is great. We also use fingerprint authentication for security of our phones. We can choose which technology to use for devices. I think it's time to focus other aspects and departments. I hope the medical technology will develop more and more.
10522,"I agree with your opinion because in this case, it is not allowed to bring their children, so they should not their child. Also I agree with your point that government need to create better environment for working women."
10523,"I think Trump had difficulty making this decision.Surely,he understands how improper it is to prohibit transgender people from serving in the armed services.But they cant take a bath,a bathroom with other soldiers ,change their cloths and sleep in the same room.If he allows them to enter the troops,he will face many perplexities."
10524,"About Japanese politicians Yuka Ogata's action, surely she disturbed chamber course, and breached the low of chamber. In that point, she should apologize for this. But, in the long run, I think her action will contribute to gender equality in Japan. Although nobody know her action will cause in the future, I praise her courage."
10525,"I agree with you. There are many values in the world, so we should consider carefully what is proper role. What is more, this role should fit background in the era. Those weak sometimes claim their right because of their past when they were suppressed. Surely a policy to save these people is necessary. But then we mustn't generate a new suppress."
10526,"Hurricane is unfamiliar to we Japanese. Some say 'abnormal climate' such as global warming causes and others says it doesn't have any relationships between the two. We can't avoid facing environmental problems. Nature power is so strong for human, and can't predict. We should have more research for this permanent issues."
10527,"Japanese government should make many environments for working women. Government often tells that they are going to do action to this problem. But nothing changes in fact. So if we want to make comfortable environment for men and women, we must claim to government strongly."
10528,"AI is very useful, however, I think there are more dangerous things than great points of it. When we use AI, we should understand both good and bad side."
10529,"We are free to believe any religion.If people who believe a minor religion force to flee their own country just because they believe it,this is invasion of their rights and immoral.Aung San Suu kyi must reconsider what she should do so that they can lead a happy life."
10530,I agree with your opinion. I won't have bad impression to bringing child to work. But we have to make more better situations to women.
10531,I respect them because they have studied their major for a long time patiently.They never gave up and achieved their object.The sense of achievement they felt then was the most brilliant in their life.They taught us how important it is to continue to do.
10532,I think so too. This problem is made up by biased Japanese customs. We should not have strict eyes to working women.
10533,"I think what Aung San Suu Kyi did for Myanmar is great, however, her behavior of goodness leaded a misunderstanding. And She collected attentions from other countries.The problem is deep-rooted and difficult to solve. However, I think government needs to have power to control the military."
10534,I completely agree your comment 'we should sometimes think by ourselves.' . Imagination which is the most important in order to progress need thinking by human. Is it possible for AI to image and generate something new.
10535,"I think the same thing you say. However hard we try yo change institution of work, it is difficult to solve the current state unless we change our views of work."
10536,"I've heard this achievement is awesome, because it's been thought to get gravitational waves' effective record. Their persistent efforts and hard works bring them Novel physics prize."
10537,"I agree with you. In this global society, the issue has so important meanings. The issue may effect all over the world. So we have to consider this issue too."
10538,"I favor your view you regret at the victims in first. in order to hinder such a sorrow from spreading, we should consider how to work in Japanese society."
10539,"I am curious about the 'permanent problem' you pointed. Since you used the word 'permanent', that means this problem will never be solved, how can we solve this problem soon."
10540,"Although her father was killed in her childhood and she faced many difficulties,she is absolutely lucky to escape from Afghanistan and to be a good soccer player.And I respect her because she wants to be a doctor.I think she wants to work for people who were wounded in their faces in the war.I was really impressed and inspired by this news."
10541,"I agree with your opinion. I have not think about feminism before this news. In Japan, there are still so many problems for feminism now."
10542,I agree with you. We need to accept various personalities without gender. We should do our best to take away inequalities.
10543,"I cannot agree KN, professor of political science's opinion. She/he said ' Japanese people are being asked if they are happy with postwar liberal democracy or whether they want to revive an older Japan and its values.' I don't think the older Japanese view revive. I don't think the Japan's originality exist in militarism."
10544,"I agree with the idea that the Constitution should be changed soon.Prime Minister Abe supports this idea.As his power gets bigger,China and Korea began to say that the militarism returns.Of course,changing the Constitution has nothing to do with the militarism.It is not the exaggeration to say that no wonder a nation has the troops.They denounce him because they are scared of him.And now,the relationship between Japan and US is pretty good.Japan don't have the troops.So the security treaty between Japan and US is extremely important."
10545,"I disagree with your opinion. I think her behavior is selfish. Certainly it is important to attract attention, but she should have found another way to do."
10546,I agree with you. Overtime work should be taken away by society. We must not think that overtime working is good behavior and we should get home right now to work better next day. I think this is better than overtime working.
10547,"Now a days, I often hear the news about AI. I heard that AI is rapidly developing and would exceed human brains. In my opinion, AI is very convenient tool and will help us a lot. However, we have to understand that there are some risks about using AI too. I have to be careful of how to use AI."
10548,"It is important to value women. It is because it is weaker than men. Moreover, I think that it is the reason that there is a big work of life called birth. But do not forget that it will produce reverse discrimination. Overprotective creates reverse discrimination, which in turn disrupts the balance of society."
10549,"Honestly, the problem about North Korea is too difficult to solve because the reason they carry out such a dangerous action many times is not the end to threat other countries but keep their political system. So, I cannot say which measure is proper. But only one I can say is that I should keep the relationship with North Korea."
10550,"When I first read this news, I was very shocked. I didn't know that so many people die in Karoshi. In japan, it is very natural that people keep working after proper working time. In about 3 years, I will work in some company. Hopefully, the Karoshi problem will be solved until then."
10551,"As long as the baby is calm and doesn't prevent the Assembly from going,she shouldn't be made to get out of the chamber.The number of women who are politicians are very small.This fact is famous in the world.The government of Japan should take some action to solve this problem.Inequality in politic must be improved as soon as possible."
10552,"I think Japanese government should solve this situation. Now, a lot of mothers want to find nursery schools is still in Japan, so I hope that government makes more efforts to improve the society."
10553,I recognize the risk of global warming each time we hear such a news. I should reduce the use quantity of fuels.
10554,I agree with you. It is still natural in Japan that men work outside and women work at home and raise their child. We should think about feminism to make it equal between men and women.
10555,Japanese workers basically sacrifice themselves according to company policies and regulations in many cases. I feel that the atmosphere of the workplace also forces that kind of thing. Such a bad culture established in Japan has been going on for a long time and the government should make efforts to create an environment to eliminate these.
10556,"In my opinion, the most important problem in Japanese politics is a low voting rate. Even the voting age became 18, this problem hasn't solved yet. We cannot say that the result of the voting is the opinion of all the people in Japan. I think education of politics would be stronger in junior high and high school to make the voting rate higher and make Japan a better country."
10557,"I agree with your idea. Sometimes the idea of protecting the weak goes to the extreme. We should always keep in the mind that words, such as gender equality, is more influential than we think. We cannot use these words selfishly. We should consider carefully about the minority and the majority at the same time."
10558,"I think this is a serious problem. This news shows how hard mothers with children are. Abe says that he would make Japan a more comfortable country for women, but what this news about is against the Abe's opinion. We have to solve this problem as soon as possible."
10559,I think many Japanese are not interested in election so they chose Abe for maintaining the status quo. That also appeared in voter turnout. We should vote more carefully .
10560,I think so too. We have to be interested in politics. We should vote with responsibilities.
10561,"The global warming is a serious problem now a days. Because of the global warming, there are many hurricanes all over the world. We should act something to stop global warming. Otherwise we are going to die because the natural power is much stronger than ours."
10562,"You mentioned that there is little discrimination between little boys and girls. However, kids are naive. Adults should behave well so have a good influence on kids. Sadly, discriminations are created in our minds, in our society even though no one is inferior to others."
10563,"When I first read this news I was really surprised. The technology is developing rapidly. However, in my opinion I don't need the face recognition technology for my phone since there are such risks. I'm actually fine with the password and finger print. We should be careful using new technologies."
10564,I agree with your idea. AI is very convenient tool for us but we have to be careful to use it. Otherwise it would lead our life wrong way. We should always remember that AI has some risks.
10565,"AI is a very useful tool and should be utilized to a great extent. But it is a good side, conversely monitored by AI. In other words, human society is controlled by AI. I am afraid of becoming such a society and I hope it will not be the case."
10566,"I was interested in this topic from before. We don't know much about the universe. However, this discovery make us dream about the time machine. Even though it would take a long time to use practical, we should keep studying this topic."
10567,"There are a lot of people in the world who are in a disadvantaged environment unlike Japanese people. It is a so-called refugee. Of course there is a danger of accepting refugees. However, Japan as a developed country should proactively protect refugees."
10568,"There are a lot of people in the world who are in a disadvantaged environment unlike Japanese people. It is a so-called refugee. Of course there is a danger of accepting refugees. However, Japan as a developed country should proactively protect refugees. However, in that case criteria for judging should be new and severe."
10569,"One more thing to mention. My friend's father has been dead due to the heart disease and two of his colleagues have been dad due to the same problem. Even if the workers don't commit to suicides, karoshi is likely to cause the serious health issues. So we should deal with working condition immediately."
10570,That's right. I think good sleep makes good work. So it's better to go home early and sleep well than to work till late. I think so.
10571,"According to this article, the strength of hurricanes is influenced by global warming. I think we can't avoid the damage of hurricanes, but we can try to stop the progress of global warming. Now, Global warming is a big problem which all people face. We should consider this problem. Every person has to take environment-friendly action."
10572,"I don't think what Ms.Ogata did is the wisest action. It was a little extreme. However, her action had a key role in the sense that to highlighted a problem faced by Japanese women and raise an issue. I hope her brave action get paid off."
10573,I agree with you. I think the time has come for to wipe out a stereotypical custom.
10574,"Literally, we need to pay more attention to women and give more support so that they are not forced to face such problems."
10575,"I wrote comment about this article, but I have more things to say. The title of this article seems to be usual, but the contents really impressed me. Even if the biotic suit makes the paralyzed woman run easier, I think it was still hard for her to accomplish the marathon. If I were in her position, I wouldn't do my best and give up at once."
10576,I strongly agree with you. People who are very influential in the world such as a president should think carefully how influential they are before say a thing in public since they can even start a war by just a word.
10577,I agree with your opinion that Japanese constitution will not be changed significantly. We need to discuss what the constitution really means.
10578,"I agree with you. But racial discrimination is not a thing of past ,it's a thing of present and still exists. So, to make young Japanese understand the problem of racial discrimination , we have to look at not only past but also present. And it can be said to LGBT problem."
10579,"I disagree with you. I believe climate change occurred because of our action. Some scientist believe there is no global warming . But I think they just don't see the reality. It's time to look at the reality and take actions. Since Climate change occurred by our action , we can stop it by our action."
10580,"In our history, when a new technology invented, there is some people who try it for their benefits. So, before we use such new technology , we have to deeply understand both good and bad points of it . We should use it , not being used."
10581,"Before the election , she was a hero as a symbol of democracy . But after holding the power , it seems she is using her power to sweep people who stand against her. It is not only the case with this problem, the history proves it. So I'm so worry about Myanmar government. And needless to say, all the people have rights to live peacefully and therefore should be respected."
10582,We cannot say that one opinion is right and the other is wrong. Trying to understand each other and overcome the bias will help us get out of conflicts.
10583,"I agree with you. It is true that she is in really hard position , but since she received Nobel Peace Prize as a hero of democracy, she have to take actions as such. Also , in the history , there are always people who run the government as a dictator after holding the power peacefully. So I'm so worry about Aung San Suu Kyi ."
10584,"In many cases , protestants just want to find faults of opponents . History is the past. And in this case, Koike is not the one who killed many Korean 70years ago. It is of course important for us to understand and regret and show condolence about the history of Japan and Korea even if it's sad and tragedy history . It seems to me they're just barking on the wrong tree."
10585,"Japanese people work so much longer than the people in Europe. Even though it can be said as 'culture', it is an unchangeable fact. Something has to be done to this circumstance."
10586,AI has becoming wiser and wiser recently. We have to try to control them so that they will not destroy our lives.
10587,It is really hard to overcome bias because human easily think that 'I am right'. We need to make more efforts to understand others.
10588,"The best way to solve the problem is having conversation but you know, its too late for them. The world has to give some radical damage to them."
10589,It is kinda tough to feel that we are living on the tiny planet. We need to try living sustainable lives.
10590,"Your view is interesting. I think it is related the rate of suicide how much people earn income. Especially in Japan, there is a tendency that workers are difficult to submit over work. So we should rapid solve this tendency."
10591,it can be said wrong to blame Ms Koike for the genocide. but we have to learn the lesson from it.
10592,Aung San Suu Kyi is playing a really big role in the world in that she cares about minorities.
10593,We need to solve the problem asap to sustain our lives.
10594,I agree with you. But that was not the best way to attract attention. The problem is not in her but in this male-dominated society. I hope this news help to change the this situation.
10595,We have to look outside of our country to understand other people in the world who have different culture and religion.
10596,I agree with your opinion. Voting rate shows the interest to the government for Japanese. So we can find that Japanese don't pay attention to political. I think that I firstly go to election.
10597,"In these days, Japanese technical industry are in dangerous situation. I think the before ways to stabilize the company are not accepted right now. Reconsidering the better way to improve company isn't easy. But we have to solve it swiftly."
10598,We need to solve the problem asap to sustain our lives.
10599,"Transgender has to be admitted as a gender. DIVERSITY of gender, love and life."
10600,I think that Japan should be more tolerant of women's advancement in society. I think that there should be no such thing as Kumamoto's news this time. We should review women's policies by learning Western countries.
10601,"I disagree with your opinion, because if AI becomes more convenient , AI may work instead of human. And most of us may lose our jobs. So I can't agree."
10602,"I think that AI can become a god. Because I believe that everyone believes. Whether it is a person or not, if it is thought that a person is a god it becomes a god."
10603,"I voted last election. All Opponents of Abe say that they want to beat Abe and they don't admit Abe. I think that's the biggest problem. They have to overcome Abe if they really want to make Japan better. But in reality , they always try to find faults of Abe. The right to vote means that we also have duty to vote. And I think everyone should vote, that's the best way to make our society really better."
10604,"Japan is an equal country. However, there are many countries in the world that are not so. In this article Afghan women have no right. For that reason they do not have the right to sport. It becomes a refugee by not agreeing with the state. I think it is necessary for Japan to accept refugees to contribute to the world."
10605,I think it is essential for North Korea to continue to show the attitude of dialogue. I think that the use of force should be avoided as much as possible. It is desirable that the world does not use force to peace.
10606,"I agree with you. I think the reason Abe won the election is that there was no choice but to vote for Abe. So it means we took better way , not the best way. As you say , it's really important for us to understand the policies each party has to make the right decision."
10607,"As we move further into the 21st century, the working environment diversified and people have different thoughts towards the way of working. A good example here is this case which the woman bring their baby to the chamber in order to insist her opinion. I think her action affected the mass of people, especially women who have children."
10608,I partly disagree with your opinion. I think the woman showed many people the desirable working environment by bringing her child. It appears to be true that some people were affected by her.
10609,"I think Japanese people like keeping to the regulations. It is strong point of Japanese people,but it brings about negative impact on society of Japan.We have to think more flexibly than before now and response to internationalization as country and human."
10610,I partly agree with you. Everyone have the right to think freely. But my ideal of this problem is that we can have the world where everybody doesn't have to even think about sex. We are all same as human. I know it's not so easy to change this situation. So it's really important for us to change the image of Feminism as a first step to fill the gap between men and women.
10611,I agree with you. Because the world in which women who are raising children is hard to work is not ideal.
10612,"I agree to your opinion. I think that AI has a lot of possibilities, but we should be careful to use it. We have to judge whether the technology is a good aspect or bad aspect."
10613,I am favorable to your opinion. It is undoubtedly undeniable that we have to change the Japanese society like what the woman did in order to improve the working environment of women.
10614,I agree with you. Because the situation where only one party is strong is politically not ideal. I hope the opposition will come up.
10615,"I agree with you. Because the strength of men and women's body is different, there is a suitable work and environment for each. In other words, we must not force society where women must make a social advance."
10616,"I think so. It is true that AI has the possibility of replacing human work, but there is a lot of things that only human beings can do."
10617,Personally identify with your enforcement. Her mother's message 'There is no work that is more important than a life.' is ponder-able for every working people. I think it is important to change the work condition.But I think that changing attitude about working. Work life balance is distillate of working.
10618,I am one of the 'karoshi chose people' for presentation.I focused this news. It is because.This news is coming under the spotlight in Japan. I think that solution needs not only provision from government but also provision from each company. We have to think of working time in the way which is short worker win approval. .
10619,Personally identify with your enforcement. Her mother's message 'There is no work that is more important than a life.' is ponder-able for every working people. I think it is important to change the work condition.But I think that changing attitude about working. Work life balance is distillate of working.
10620,"I partly disagree with you. It's true Japanese people are over working , but the definition of happiness is different by people. Also, in Japan people who has much money are regarded as successful, so it's really hard to change our view of work and happiness."
10621,"I agree to you. I have friends living in America. They really enjoy their lives. They prioritize time with family and friends. It is often said that Japanese work too much, I think so. We Japanese should emulate them."
10622,"I should consider more deeply about election and Japan's future when I vote. Like the Party of Hope, new parties are made for every election. Of course the number of policies are increasing, and they will have more diversity. So we may easily lose our vision for ideal politics. We should have more attention to their policy than to its impression. Also I think it is important HOW to change the Article 9, because as someone said Japan may need to match the condition of other countries, and the Article 9 may be too old way of thinking, but I think Japan must not cause any war."
10623,"I completely agree with you. Facing dramatic developing of AI , it's time for us to think about what we are and the thing we only human can do , but AI can't. And it's really important for us to remind that AI is a tool to make our world convenient , so we should not be decided what to do by AI and not being exploited by AI."
10624,Facial recognition technology to unlock the device is very comfortable and attractive. But we can live without this technology and this technology may cause some problems such as misusing by some terrorists or governments. It is important that all people should deeply understand about this technology.
10625,"Thank you for replying to me. I think your opinion is true, but if anyone who faces difficult condition about money can change his/her view of work or find other style of happiness, he/she will live more easily and think about future optimistically."
10626,"Thank you for replying to me. Of course it is good to be able to work happily, but we can be happy in any other ways. I hope many people live happily too."
10627,I agree with you. Japan has a ridiculous tradition. It is that old people receive more salary than young people regardless of their work. Therefore I think we should change this tradition.
10628,"What she has done are understandable if we see it from Myanmar position.But,from international point of view, it is unreasonable that the Myanmar government interpret Rohingyas as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although they have lived there for long time. They equally have the rights to live safely. I hope she will have initiative to cope with this problem as a winner of the Nobel peace prize."
10629,"I was surprised to the fact. Karoshi is not a problem that is not totally we are related, but it is caused anywhere and for anyone. As you said, it is important to speak out for the better work systems."
10630,"The problem of refugee is really hard to think , especially for Japanese, since Japan is an island country and her population is composed of just one ethnic. I can't happily say that we should accept refugee, because I saw terrible reality in German and many European countries after accepting refugees. But we have to solve this problem because we are all same human. So what we have to do is to help the weak and beat the strong. We must achieve it by any means."
10631,"I think it is impossible for AI to copy our brains or become god. because god is not made of intelligence. if they do it for the betterment of society, they should more try to know what is the god is for the disciple rather than the god itself I felt."
10632,I suspect sanction is really working. And I strongly disagree with the idea to start the war. Violence do not make peace. So it is needed to bring North Korea to negotiation by any means. That's the best and the only way to solve this problem.
10633,"I agree with you. AI doesn't have the heart like human, so it can't do the work related to it. in the future, the talent in those area rather than calculate will have important role I think."
10634,"when I read this article,I think Koike should send Eulogy for Koreans to maintain good relationship.I know that there are complex misunderstanding between japan and Korea. So, we have to understand their opinions and we,developed and civilized countries' citizen, should be kind to others. If we think from their perspective,we can easily understand what should we do. All we need is to think from the standpoint of the opponent."
10635,"Actually I don't know what feminism is because I haven't heard feminism before , but I know all people are equal. So we should not say anything about gender differences and we should do anything without gender differences."
10636,"There is possibility of WWIII, and this situation is really similar to Japan before WWII. As you say , I also think there are many things to do to cope with the problem. And we must not start the war for us and our younger generations."
10637,"I perfectly agree with you. If men support the idea of feminism, the idea that human being is all equal get more persuasive. Therefore we should spread this idea."
10638,"I think it's incredible that the scientists found new facts. The mystery of universe have always attracted attention,because its a part of the dream of all human such as exploration in American continent, on the moon.It is clear that the progress of technology helped them study, and I am looking forward to another new findings as a evidence of human's capacity."
10639,"I agree with you. Women need a better environment for working and man's help. If many of men help his wife, I think that many women live more easily and happily."
10640,"I worry about Japanese scientists . Many scientists in Japan gave up their research because of their poor condition of research. I understand Nobel prize is just honor , not the race, but I still want Japanese scientists to receive such prizes. And it is said the amount of money for research in Japan is much smaller than other countries. I hope the environment of their research would be improved and they receive Nobel prizes and make Japan's science greater. Anyway, Congratulations to three scientists received Nobel physics prize2017!!!"
10641,"In my opinion these sanctions are effective if all countries completely did them. But, mainly China and Russia are still trading with North Korea, it would disturb its work.We have to deal with North Korea's problem as soon as we can,however, we are at a loss. Only doing less effective sanctions will never be main solutions. I think now the time we have to remember how important to negotiate!"
10642,"Human progress and robotics are closely inseparable. AI is one of them, and the development is remarkable. However, there is a risk. The current problem is an increase in the number of unemployed people caused by the development of AI. AI can easily surpass the knowledge and skills that people who are called professional in various fields with the high information processing power have obtained over the years. There is even a person who says that advancing Al's development no further is ruined the human race in the researcher. This is a very difficult problem."
10643,"I want to work as much as I can, and I want live a happy life as a woman. But I worry a little bit about living on this environment while working in the future, because how much I think, it is hard to live as a working mother in today's Japan. I hope the government listen to women's voices and make a comfortable environment for working women and everyone."
10644,'Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration. ' It's Thomas Edison 's words . This news made me understand true meaning of these words. Most important thing is keeping doing thing. I really proud of them.
10645,"I think it is bad to prohibit women play sports, because everyone has the right to do what he or she want to do. I think this principle should be prior to everything. I think she brought huge impact on refugee and women. Moreover, she is not satisfied with the present situation. If many people will be like her, the world will change to the better."
10646,I think so. There are many criticisms of the administration. In order to realize the right politics in Japan it is important for the public to understand about politics.
10647,Thank you for replying to me. I think that AI can play a important role in more complicated fields too.
10648,"I am still a student and not an adult so perfectly I don't know what is right for Japan. But I think this election will cause a lot of better things. However, the politics by almost one group is not good for the country because our voices for the country won't reach. Furthermore,we can't do anything smoothly because Japan has too many parties. Japan should keep balance to be better by reforming the election, I think."
10649,"It is important for diplomacy to keep good relationships hiding true thought. But I felt South Korea criticizes Japan too much. Doing all things they claimed us to do is not the best way to make good relationships. We should show stronger attitudes towards them , I think that would lead truly good relationships."
10650,"I think that still it cannot be said that her action is good, but the reason why we made such situation is that the Japanese system for working mothers is not established while doing child care."
10651,"I agree with your opinion.Moment is early, and Japan should increase the environment that supports a working mother while doing child care."
10652,I think so too.We should feel sense of incongruity in a thought that overtime work is natural colonizing in Japan.
10653,"I think this problem is too difficult, but we shouldn't stop to think about this problem. It is true that the sanctions are not having any effect on the behavior of the North Korean leadership. But we should keep thinking about this problem and increase the number of people who are against North Korea's politics."
10654,"I agree with your opinion.Though AI is the thing which it is very convenient, and will play an active part in our future, time when control did not work is scared most.We should make use of the human wisdom while using AI well."
10655,"I think women have responsibility to raise their child, but I think that the act of bringing a child to the chamber is wrong. I do not say that work and families should be completely distinguished, but delaying the meeting will cause tremendous inconvenience to the surroundings. However, it is also certain that improvement is necessary with respect to compatibility between women's social advancement and child raising. We should think deeply about this."
10656,I partly disagree with you. I don't think that Ms. Ogata should bring her child to the chamber. We should think about the balance between child raising and work
10657,"I think that Trump's idea is wrong. People who sacrifice themselves is should be respected. Also, president is a very influential person, so he shouldn't say political things. His words confuse people in the world."
10658,"After reading this conversation, I found that the action against North Korea isn't effective. President Trump tries to make various sanctions, but North Korea still don't change their attitude against the U.S. It is getting hard to get out of this situation"
10659,I agree with you. It can't be said that the relationship between Japan and Korea is good. Therefore it is important to act cautiously so as not to worsen this relationship anymore.
10660,"As you said, I think that current technology is advanced considerably. However, I partly disagree with you. Natural disasters are unpredictable, and I think that it is impossible to eliminate this no matter how much technology advances."
10661,I think her action attracted people's attention on Japan's working problem as you think. However it was not correct way to do that.
10662,"I think so too. In Japan, Democratic party is overwhelmingly strong so that other political parties can not compete. We must overcome this situation. Corporations between parties is one way to do that."
10663,I agree with you. Gender equality must be protected. However it is important to distinguish men and women. This is not discrimination.
10664,I disagree with you. The number of karoshi of men is about 9 time more than the number of karoshi of women. Gender is not a problem about karoshi. The problem is that long ours work done in everywhere in Japan.
10665,"I completely agree with you. We read the news about Overwork and also this article.I thought that Japanese have bad working environment regardless of gender. I heard that the government made policies about improvement of working situation but I don't know it works because I am not a worker. Anyway, it must be improve."
10666,"This article made me sad and angry. Because two men's careless and foolish action caused one woman's precious life. They cannot pay for their action and mistake enough. In Japan, prank call for police can be raised as the similar case. Such call prevent from helping the people who really need help. We shouldn't do such a thing."
10667,"I think Ms. Ogata's action was a big step to show that working mothers really need the place to childcare or environment that support them, and also her action encouraged them. However there is a rule that person who are not assembly member can not enter in the chamber, so she should have followed to the rule even if she though that she should do something to change the working women's condition."
10668,I think the same as you and I also feel that changing the environment is difficult and it would take long time. But I think that woman who are in assembly member act for working mothers is impressive for many people and it can be the good opportunity to show how the working mothers need more comfortable environment and support from the government.
10669,"I agree with you. Using the AI in correct way is good for us. But if we may use AI for the war, we mustn't develop this technology. Because that will lead worst world."
10670,I agree with you. The North Korean missile launch is no longer a declaration of war. Immediate stronger economic sanctions should be done.
10671,"I don't know that sanction would really work because even US and Japan carry out trade restriction against North Korea, China still trade with North Korea. I don't agree North Korea's political system but North Korea and Japan should talk and cooperate each other as a neighbor countries. I hope they will stop launch hydrogen bombs and build good relationship with Japan."
10672,"I was also impressed by her. She taught us that we should not forget to make efforts in any situation. And problems of refugees are what we have to think about. Though Japan is not accepting refugees now, we Japanese people have to consider the problems too."
10673,"It's very good story. I was born and raised in Japan, so such a dangerous and restricted life is unfamiliar to me. However, the freedom like developed countries' does not exist in many countries. Therefore we have responsibilities to accept refugees and to spread the concepts of freedom."
10674,AI will give us useful lives. And our technology is developing rapidly now. But the AI has a possibility of being better than human. So we should wait and see this situation carefully.
10675,I agree with you. The discovery of this gravitation wave is a historically valuable discovery. I hope that this discovery helps to deep universe research and clarification of mystery.
10676,I agree with your opinion. China and North Korea's relation is complicated and it is difficult to find the way to give some effective sanctions against North Korea. I also hope they stop development for hydrogen bomb soon.
10677,"I agree with you.It is true that the cause of aging is inequality between men and women,so we have to commit this inequality problem first."
10678,"I think that the negative spiral caused by sanctions and oppositions to them would continue endlessly. That is to say, sanctions are not effective and we must have other ways to deal with the North Korea problems."
10680,I don' t think it a good idea that AI will become as god because we should not rely on AI. We have to consider both merits and demerits of using AI.
10681,"when I read the news story, I think it can motivate and encourage Japanese scientist. Treatment for scientist in Japan is not so good. I hope government or universities make better conditions for research."
10682,"I am against you. In fact, it is necessary to make a society where both men and women can work, but it should not be an economically weak country where women are obliged to work."
10683,"I can't believe that we can make AI god by the latest technologies. However, I also think that AI god could finish the religious war which happens all over the world."
10684,"After I read this article, I thought most Japanese worker are very diligent and tend to accumulate the stress. It is necessary to change the working environment."
10685,"I had a same impression after I read this news, I didn't know that Karoshi is occurring in Japan a lot and I thought we must know and think a solution for this problem. I think there are more people in Japan who don't know how terrible problem occurs in our country."
10686,I really excited when I saw this news. I do not have much knowledge about cosmos but I hope to release many mystery about this.
10687,"In the recent election, we had the chance to deeply think about the parties in Japan. I basically agree with the ideas of the LDP. Considering the revision of Article 9, not only politicians but also for students like us should more discuss about it. In the aspect of pacifism, I think the revision of the constitution is critical to our future. In order to make a correct judgement, we need to pay close attention to the right information to elect people."
10688,I was surprised when I read this headline because I imagined that it's hard for refugees just to live. I guess she has strong will. There is much more good chances and surroundings. So I decide to make a great effort and make my dream come true.
10689,I think Japanese old custom caused 'karoshi'. 'Overtime work is proper ' is not familiar to developed countries except Japan. So we should change the present situation and improve the working environment.
10690,I disagree with your opinion. There was the only way for her. And this situation is caused by Japanese custom. So we have to change this situation. And her action was brave .
10691,I knew this discovery would cause us to realize time machine when I saw your comment. It's very fantastic thing!! I am not make sure I can live until birth of that.
10692,"I partly agree with you. I think we demand a lot of convenience not to work so much depending on such as machines, AI and so on. We should think this existing state again that this current status is really correct or not."
10693,I agree with you. We start from collecting correct information and making ourself opinion.
10695,"Justin Trudeau's idea is very good, l think. The ability to judge what is truly right is needed for all people. So l want to spread his idea and to raise my son as feminist in the future."
10696,"I have heard a lecture from a man who had do democratic activity with Aung San Suu Kyi. He said that the problem of Rohingya was a difficult problem to solve. He said that Rohingya people also do something not good (I forgot exactly something). From International view, persecution must be occurred, but I should also understand her opinion, too."
10697,"I agree with your opinion. I think LGBT people are normal and there are more than we think. I think transgender is one of the view that people live and we should not discriminate about one's thought, but Donald Trump is the America's president and he has a big impact to the world. I have an anxiety that world's opinion goes a bad way."
10698,"I think Tokyo Gov.Yuriko Koike should take responsibility for one's own statement more. I don't know whether Koike actually take care of own statement.But, she has power of influence from Tokyo 2020 in the fact. I want to Koike breaking a leg."
10699,"After I read this article, I had a same impression with you. I know that new technology is convenient for people's lives and it is necessary to develop our society, but at same time, we should think many risks what occurs when the technology develops too much."
10700,I agree with you. Because the problem of Rohingya greatly violates human rights. I hope that they will be given the right position as soon as possible.
10701,"This technology allow us to have more convenient life. However, it also has some points related to security, and we have to be careful when we use this. Whether we use this or not is on our responsibility."
10702,"I agree with you. However right the idea seems, the way to force is dangerous."
10703,I agree with you. We should think and take an action for North Korea. I think Japanese should have more danger awareness for North Korea.
10704,"in JAPAN,women don't have enough environment to juggle their children . this situation is so serious. I think this situation comes from gender in equality .so we should change this situation"
10705,"I agree with jk's opinion .Prime Minister Abe has been criticized by many people recently, but in the end he will win the recent election.Thus I think there is a a lot of possibility Prime Minister Abe will succeed in juggle Japanese society."
10706,"I agree with Justin's opinion .It's a good idea we should respect boys' right to be not like a typical man we think ,but they can be the way they think. Some boys don't like to play outside and they prefer playing with girls. this idea should be respected by us. so we should change our thought."
10707,I agree with you. Because climate change is changing not only by human industry but by a variety of factors. I think that it is not what we can control.
10708,"When I read this news, I was very surprised and excited that we can know about our cosmos more. This discovery surely help our studies."
10709,I have never heard the news that three US-based scientists have won this year's Nobel Prize in Physics for their contributions to the observation of gravitational waves. I live in the society that unreality becomes reality. I expect that Japan will produce more Nobel Prize winners and they change common sense of the world.
10710,"I think overtime work is sometimes needed ,but this situation should not be ordinary situation.However,in japan, even if workers work overtime , companies don,t make enough reward. I think this situation should be changed."
10711,I've thought about what Dr.ED said. Yuriko Koike is probably the only female politician I know. It's really a big issue that developed country like Japan have gender equality problem. I think Japanese politic and economical environment have to change before it's too late.
10712,"I think so .I agree with Justin's opinion .It's a good idea we should respect boys' right to be not like a typical man we think ,but they can be the way they think. Some boys don't like to play outside and they prefer playing with girls. this idea should be respected by us. so we should change our thought."
10713,"i thought this kind of act was very unique. however the point is that she should have kept the rules on council. If you ask me, i think bringing her baby is definitely leave a strong impact. Thus she had left a controversial issue that we really need to discuss. Work Life balance should be commanded appropriately in Japan. we need to learn working systems just like countries in Europe."
10715,I really agree with you. The environment in that it is difficult to express workers' opinion affects the high suicide rate of workers in Japan. We have to make working condition more comfortable.
10716,I agree with you . People may be governed by machines. So we develop our brain. I think machines is governed our brain. So this situation can be prevented.
10717,He was elected president 7times.This is the historical record.I think cause of this is the power of him in foreign things.
10718,"I can agree with your opinion,We have yo observe the situation carefully."
10719,"in recent election, we had the chance to deeply think about parties in japan. i think LDP has a good idea. Considering the revision of the constitution, not only politicians but also students like us should discuss more about it. In order to make correct judgements, we need to pay close attention to the right information to elect people."
10720,I think so too. In this issue is necessary for us. We have to think about it carefully.
10721,good point. we really need to learn more about it and discuss it actively.
10722,"I agree with your opinion that If we don't forget its risk, we can use it more comfortable. We have to seek for the way to do that."
10723,I agree with you. This is a complicated issue that we need to think deeply. We need to build an environment which is friendly for them.
10724,"I was astonished, too. Women should have kept the rules. However this was a unique way that I support."
10725,I think what she did is wrong because it certainly prevent the meeting from going. And it is said that she only hesitated to use money for expense of nursery school. At least she indicated the rack of institution for mother.
10726,"I cannot answer how much the fine is proper. So, I do not agree with your comment 'Dentsu has been fined 500000 yen only.'"
10727,I think that as the number of feminists increases it gets closer to gender equality. Of course we have rights to think freely but I want many people to think about feminism .
10728,I think that the right of transgender people should not be infringed at all. Because in the democratic US and Japan the rights to minorities such as transgender must be respected rather.
10729,"In this election, division of opposition parties caused Abe's win, I think. Many people think Abe's party have some problems but he is comparatively good. And Abe has got some results about today's economic situation,which other party doesn't have."
10730,"I think if all countries agree with the idea, sanctions is effective.But North Korean disagrees.So we should try for the country to negotiate.In order to do this, we should bring Norton Korean back to negotiating table with other countries."
10731,I agree with your opinion.I also respect people who are sacrificing their bodies for the countries.The president should not say important things on the Twitter because we don't know whether his sayings is important or unimportant.
10732,"I also agree with you. In advanced information society, we always have to think of the same risk anytime with any devices.So, for making decreasing this risk,we have to pay attention well."
10733,"I agree with you. Honestly, I am sure that Ms.Ogata's behavior that she took her son to the city Congress was wrong. However, she took such action though she might know that to show the difficulty which Japanese working women have. Japanese government and local governments have to recognize her action seriously, and take some measures to this problem."
10734,I believe that human definitely have an adverse effect on the earth. Human can not live without the earth but the earth can live without human beings.
10735,I also think this is a serious issue. We need to change the system of working overtime.
10736,I think this problem is serious but we should change old custom
10737,"I also heard of this news beforehand. I was so depressed about it. long time working is considered as a part of Japanese culture. However, it is high time we should make a revision about this working system."
10738,"I also think it is frightening. However if you ask me,AI cannot overcome humans. So we should not be that frightened."
10739,"I think developing AI technology is good,but people should respect people more."
10740,"This kind of old custom is not reasonable. But it is very difficult to change such customs. In Japan, woman's right doesn't accepted sufficiently. Japan should catch up with other developed countries about some rights and freedom."
10741,I think hurricanes are concerns for Japanese people because from July to September many typhoon and many disasters follow it such as sudden price jump and landslide. It is impossible to prevent these things perfectly but it is possible to save the suffer from typhoon .So not only investigate the typhoon also should spend money for preparing
10742,"I think so too. The development of AI is wonderful and there are promises, but I think that there is something we can do."
10743,"Japan's ruling camp wins two-thirds majority in lower house election amid opposition splitting-up as a result. I don't understand the result but, I have to accept it as a member of democratic state."
10744,"It is true that women's social advancement is delayed in Japan, but I think that it is necessary to observe the rules."
10745,AI is very useful tool but we must use it carefully.
10746,"I think so. In conclusion, password and order system is best for locking our phone."
10747,"I disagree with your opinion. Such curiosity caused big accidents. For example, the atomic bomb to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We consider after something was already happened. It is too late. We have to consider about AI as soon as possible."
10748,I disagree with this opinion. Because I think that the current rule should be kept even if whoever complains something.
10749,"It is hard for us to prevent disasters but we can prepare for when it occurs and minimize damage. Also, we can make effort in order not to make many disasters by improving the earth's environment. We should star with what we can do by ourselves."
10750,"I think the current working environment in Japan is serious. Since long hours work and harassment etc. are one after another, it is necessary to improve. As a countermeasure, I think that it is best to encourage people return home."
10751,I think Japanese should change the idea of working
10752,"I agree with your own opinion. AI is so terrible technology that we must consider how to use this difficult content. When AI become existence beyond from us, we won't do anything."
10753,"I agree with your opinion. She is a mother, but at the same time she is a law maker who is responsible for us. I want her to be more sincere to her work. I strongly believe that there must have been better way to protest."
10754,"Recently, this problem of Japanese women and their babies is often viewed as a problem. I think the biggest reason is that women's feeling is not calm. If they are kind by men, that alone will increase women's satisfaction. So, Japanese men should be more gentlemen."
10755,"I felt a little weird about the article in that it is referring the child care as the only women's thing to confront because of the balance of the work. I think it's not good to draw these problem like 'the battle between men and women', it becomes a discrimination towards men in other aspect. In this article's case, they should also try to get the time for men to care their children. In the feminist activity, men and women working together is the important thing I believe."
10756,I agree with Justin I think men also should accept their rights.
10757,I agree with this opinion. I am not happy that the word karoshi is famous in the world. I think that such culture must be improved.
10758,"I agree with your opinion. Until the time of previous cabinet, though there was opinions to change the constitution, it was worked by changing the interpretation. I have just knowledge as a university student, but I am worried about Japan and Japanese future."
10759,I agree with your opinion.she has to make best choice for the citizens.
10760,"I agree with your opinion. Ms. Ogata should have thought about the possibility of her son disturbing the discussion and acted more carefully. However, I admit that her action is brave. It did attract attention and make us contemplate the problem ."
10761,I think it's not enough for men to help women taking care of babies during leisure time. The thought that 'it is woman to take care of babies and men just help them' itself is making the inequality of gender. So at first we should change our thinking of it.
10762,I think Abe's part is not best. But it is better to choose his party. I want to appear good political party.
10763,"I partially agree with you.Low voting rate is serious problem, but teaching politics in the school is very difficult. This is because it is possible for the teacher to force his/her own opinions on students."
10764,"At this election, I was so wondered to vote to whom and which party. It was my first time to vote and I knew that there was no perfect party policy to fit my opinion, but it was very difficult. Though there are no attractive person and party, I have a right and duty to vote, so I will do forever. Anyway I hope some people or parties that which have enough knowledge and skills to be a center of Japanese Politic"
10765,"Even if many countries conducted sanctions to north Korea, I think it won't negotiate with US because the top of this country suffer from it and countries such as China and Russia may export articles to bother US. And by Sanctions the number of ships coming to Japan sea will increase to gain marine products. So to make sanctions more efficient, we have to gain cooperation of China and Russia and ban the influx of parts for munitions."
10766,"Some people say his opinion is extreme, but I do not think so. I think that he is simply trying to recognize diversity and is very natural. Because I think that it is not necessary to do something addicted to type because it is a woman or man."
10767,I think it is not enough for women to take care of their children. Japanese should change social system.
10768,"I partly disagree with your opinion. It is true that we should set the environment that is easy for mothers to raise their kids. However, bringing kids to the chamber is not acceptable. Mr. Ogata is a law maker responsible for us. She shouldn't make any delay to the meeting because of her private issues."
10769,Thank you for your reply! Anyone can't solve the problem by oneself. The workers have to unite to face a company.
10770,"I agree with your opinion because I also think that gender equality is important but we should not overthink about that. Sometimes,we need to distinguish men and women because they are fiscally different."
10771,"I agree with your idea. It is true that Japanese economy is declining, therefore the Japanese society needs more women to work. I think it is too much for working women to be both mother and worker at the same time. We definitely should have better social support for those women so that they can work in a comfortable environment."
10772,I agree with you that it is essential to make more comfortable working women. But I think we should also do it for men. I have heard that ' unmarried men' are more likely to be had worked so much because of that reason. I open that the working place change in good way for everyone.
10773,I agree with you. It is important for Japan to hear women politicians' voice so we should protect women politicians.
10774,'Heaven does not build a man above a person and does not build a person under a person.' It's message from Yukichi Fukuzawa.And he added efforts create a status difference. But this is too much inequality to live. Racism is irrelevant for whatever reason.
10775,"I agree with this opinion. It is also a reason why women's advancement in Japan is delayed, but I think that his idea is correct in the sense of respecting diversity."
10776,I think so. He conducted many financial policies . And Japan is about to overcome the lost two decades. Some economists predict the rise of wage will occur in 2018. To achieve it sudden change of leader is not preferred.
10777,"I agree that the working circumstances are becoming complex in modern society. Especially in Japan, due to the population decrease, the way of working might change. Both women and men have to work in the future. considering that, we really need to focus on making working system which is healthy for women."
10778,"Japanese workers basically work for the company, sacrificing themselves. Therefore, I think that the company must stop them from working too much. In addition, the government should take measures to protect workers."
10779,I agree with you. The fear that they may not be able to back to the former post make them apart from giving birth to a baby. It is a good idea to change that.
10780,I respect Aung San Suu Kyi very much. She is very brave. You should imitate everything to convert ideas into actions and execute them reliably.
10781,I disagree with Trump because his idea ignores the human rights. We should consider individual gender problem.
10782,I agree with your point that politics by just one group is not good. They cannot know the opinion from other side and they tend to have biased opinion.
10783,"He is too irresponsible for his statements. Until then, he bursts into flames many times. I thought that 'oh, again!?' The international fashion is respecting each persons identity. his tweet retrograded against this fashion. For my opinion, I think everyone has right to have gender to fit each and declare that. Now,sadly that doesn't come true. Especially in Japan, huge stereotypes remained. That is a big problem. We should have actions to improve this."
10784,"I disagree with this opinion. It is certainly possible to think that there is nobody else who can withdraw Japan other than Mr. Abe. However, I believe that wrong policies must be conveyed to the nation properly as people's will."
10785,This news reminded me of the fear of internet. Everybody can see what's on internet and once you posted something on it you can't delete it forever. It's important to 'take a moment before press the send button'.
10786,"In Japan, citizens have low awareness and responsibility for elections. I think that should improve first."
10787,I agree with you. I wish Abe would change today's situation in Japan.
10788,"I can't agree with your opinion absolutely . Certainly I think Japan should accept more refugees, but to do it we have to do many policies. For example ,to work in Japan , they have to learn Japanese ,and Japanese manner,culture and history to get along with other people . In this point we can't accept them limitlessly."
10789,I think this article shows us the problem of Japan. Not to mention death from overwork is absolutely never done. However it hasn't stooped. I think this is big problem. It is seen as a big problem such as death from overwork. But it isn't solve now. Many problem is to delay in our country. I think it is because that Japanese people have low awareness. It have to be considered about Japanese low awareness as soon as possible.
10790,"I think so too. In Japan a lot of men take strict actions to women, so basically Japanese people should change our perspectives. But,our perspectives were made by Japanese history so it is too difficult to change our perspectives. It's a too difficult problem."
10791,I think so. we have to have the ability to tell true from false not only on SNS but also on TV.
10792,"I agree with your opinion. I was also surprised when I saw this news. I have never think AI as a god. I know AI is so intelligent and it's becoming more humanistic but I think it cant be God. Any way I am interested in those AI development. Of course there are risks, but hope it will help our life and society."
10793,"I think it is necessary to arrange more the market of changing the job. Because even when people are made to work too much, they cannot quit the job because they can't get the money if they quit the job and there are no good choice in the changing job market. In the future when I work, I want to choose job in that aspect also."
10794,"I do not agree with the opinion of Donald Trump. There are many remarks that people who have to summarize the country as President of the United States will confront the people, and they are not admitted. He should speak out thinking more about his own people."
10795,"I know there is no perfect party, but Abe is the better choice because he has the leadership at the least. Most of people support him because he is trying to do something, such as stimulating the economic, and it is what citizens hope for. But I can not support Abe's idea of changing the meaning of the constitution."
10796,"I think what's problem is that the way of thinking Japanese people have. We tend to think that the longer or more you work the better. It's actually better if you can do same amount of work in shorter amount of time. But I hear that in Japanese company, overtime work is more rated. We have to be and think more efficiently. Then these kinds of incidents won't happen again."
10797,"I agree with your thinking. His appointing a cabinet with an equal number of men and women, it seems easy but it is actually difficult."
10798,"There are merit and demerit. As you said, if AI developed very well, we will most our jobs. Although AI is much more accurate than human. So it's really useful and helpful. I think we have to think about life with AI seriously."
10799,I agree with you. I wish Paris Agreement would be effective. ( The U.S. is going to withdraw from it...)
10800,"I think it's a great discovery and this will open up the new fields. In addition to those who took the Novel Prize this time, there are a lot of people around the world who are making various discoveries. Therefore Science will continue to advance in the future."
10801,"I think Koike's action is right . Certainly, it is important recognize what our country did , but they insist on what our country didn't . They build a lot of ianfu statues all over the world . It is the shameless action , and we have to say what they do is wrong!"
10802,I agree with you. I also got surprised to know that these incidents happened in the really famous companies. The workers chose to work in those company and they must have done so much hard work to get in those company baca use these companies are popular companies. So for them there must hardly have choice to quit the job I thought. I want the companies to care more about the workers.
10803,I agree with this opinion. Only discrimination born with discriminating others.I think he should take action so that the whole country moves towards a better direction.
10804,I can't imagine the place women can't enjoy and play the sports. I want to change such a place by helping refugee
10805,I really agree with your comment on the bottom. The one you replied. It's easy to say treat man and woman equally but there are jobs that only men can do. Because we are different physically. We have to admit that facts. These day there are woman always say 'that is racism'. There are racism in some part and we have to stop them. Although I personally dislike someone who always says like that.
10806,I felt very sad to read this news because prime minister is not accepted by Okinawa's people
10807,"I have the same idea. We should consider this problem as soon as possible. I heard that in a company if all mother keep working, all workers stopped overworking, so we should protect office ladies from their retiring."
10808,It is a good thing to try to change but I think that this method will make the image worse
10809,"I agree with your opinion. You do not know the new technology much and cannot completely control it. Overall, the best solution for this case is to lock the own smartphone by the passcode, not face recognition."
10810,I agree with your opinion. Japanese people will have to be changed their mind. Many Japanese people have bad mind. This minds make Japan's bad atmosphere.
10811,"I agreed with what Trudeau said in the article. The feminism is often drawn as the battle between men and women , but I think it's not. So it is important to raise boys as feminists. In the class many people didn't raise hands as feminists I got surprised at it. I hope many people be feminists."
10812,I agree with your opinion. There is a growing trend that too much toil is regarded as a deserved thing. I think the problem of working environment is a one that we have to solve in Japan.
10813,"I have almost the same opinion as yours. Most Japanese scientists belong to universities, but the amount of money from universities in Japan is very poor. Because of this situation, the research of Japanese university is not active. I want Japanese research situation to be improved quickly."
10814,I disagree with you. I think facial recognition technology isn't need. It is many methods how to protect your iPhone.
10815,"I am not thinking to buy these new iphones, but i think this technology is great. comparing to my childhood technology has developed incredibly. although i heard some problem about this new iphones for example I heard facial recognition is not perfect on security. like other person can log in using that persons sleeping face. but if its not perfect, we still can develop our technology and can be more convenient."
10816,I agree with your opinion. Working environment is crucial when you work. I think the employer of a company should make the environment where employees are able to work comfortably and demand what kind of environment they want to work.
10817,I think Japan lags behind in gender equality In the world. I think we should change our rule.
10818,I used to think that using an AI was totally agreeable. But this news made me think more about the demerits of using an AI. Being monitored and controlled by AI would be misery. I think we shouldn't rely 100% on AI.
10819,I think it is important that opponent parties should unite in order to compete with Abe's government.
10820,I agree with you. Japanese people also say we are in happy. However we are lucky. We can be happy.
10821,The concept of feminism is so important. Males and females should have same rights in all area.
10822,I think it was too late to take care of people after death. We should care about working people before they die. It is nothing special.
10823,I think AI will get wisdom which we people can't control in near future. We have to be careful about that situation and think about it seriously.
10824,"I disagree with you.Each country has each culture and history, so each country should have perspective about feminism."
10825,"Yes, Abe should do something to make Japan a better country for women."
10826,"I disagree with you. AI is something that we made and God must be something that is beyond our imagination. The position should be humans under god, but when AI becomes god it reverses."
10827,"Yes, it is difficult to teach without forcing his/her opinion on students. However, teachers have to teach it even though it is difficult tot raise the voting rate."
10828,I wish it would be effective too.
10829,I agree with your opinion. KN and MH is correct. We have to consider about what problems are most important.
10830,I am so surprised at this news. AI is the thing which it is very convenient.I can't send my life without AI.AI technology will be developed in the future.
10831,"I agree with your opinion. Feminism is not only about girls, but also about boys problem. It is many kind of people such as boy don't like to play outside. So we have to get along with each other. World is proceeding for 'diversity'."
10832,i think the peace is the most important thing.I want Abe will be better japan.
10833,"I agree with your opinion. Babies are future of our country. So the circumstance recently in Japan, the future is dark. So we have to change this cause to be easier giving birth babies and raising babies."
10834,I agree with you.I am afraid of taking human place where artificial intelligence is taken.
10835,Yes I agree with your idea. To solve the gender equality problem I hope Trudeau's idea would be spread.
10836,"I agree with you. To develop Japanese economy, the present working environment should be improved."
10837,"Recent climate change is too violent. I do not feel the typhoon very much, but the weather seems to change as summer and winter come every other day"
10838,"I disagree with you. The fact doesn't change that baby might disturb our work. therefore, even though mothers want to bring them we should not accept it. However, we have to change social system to make it easier for women to work."
10839,I could not go to the vote because I had the tournament of my club activity in Nagoya. So I do not have the right to criticize the election.
10840,"I agree with you. Trudeau is famous person, so his opinion is very influential. So I think more and more famous people say something positive about feminism, people are influenced and may have positive thinking about it."
10841,"It's a big issue in Japan that man and woman are nor equal. This news symbolize one of the problems. As the economy is developing, more women are eager to work, but the way that people think is not changing. Even though most of the people understand that the system that man works and woman stays at house must change, somewhere in our mind there is still that kind of idea. In order to get rid of those old ideas, I think political world must change first. Then other fields would follow."
10842,I agree with you. We have to change the working environment in Japan to make it comfortable to work.
10843,"Facial recognition technology is very innovative. But it have many tasks. Facial recognition is personal information that gathers without being noticed, so it cannot be said that security is really thorough in that aspect."
10844,I agree with your opinion. From now on I feel that we need an equal society without looking at gender as a wall. Everyone wants the world that everyone admits
10845,"I think Trudeau has responsibility to make Canada gender equal society as a president too. I guess Prime Minister Abe also has the responsibility too, so I hope he also make Japan gender equal society."
10846,"I would say the problem of transgender emerged in the modern society. In Japan, the problem is not recognised yet by many people. Therefore, you have to take an interest in those kinds of problem such as LGBT."
10847,"I agree with your idea. Because I think that face recognition does not necessarily say that security is perfect. We should learn to protect yourself, not relying too much on technology."
10848,"Thank you for replying to me. Yes, it is important that women speak out their own opinion to other people, or government."
10849,"I totally agree with you. It's indeed convenient and attractive to have new technology, but everything has it's own risks. We should stick on to what we can handle and leave the things that we can't control."
10850,"I think science will make rapid progress, thanks to this discovery."
10851,"I think the crack of relation between Japan and Korea deep. When I read this article, 'Eulogy' depends for that person's feeling and not should be forced. But I also understand that sending eulogy is kind of a tradition between this association and Tokyo Prefecture. It is difficult. About relationship between Korea and Japan, I like K-pop, Korean Drama and Culture, but I don't like politics. I hope both nation will recognize each other and accept each other."
10852,I hope so too. I'm really looking forward other new discoveries.
10853,I agree with you. I didn't noticed scientists' difficulties. There are many good scientists in Japan so government should support them more to make good environment for their research.
10854,Very interesting! But this is the biggest problem of facial recognition. It is terrible to be opened my cellphone while I do not know.
10855,"I strongly agree with your opinion. Because I think that AI is very useful and helpful for our lives. However, like a this news, AI will take place of human workers. And now we face to the future that we lose our jobs. That is very big problem I think."
10856,"Before I read this article, I think AI is very useful for our lives. Because it helps our job which is unliked or hard. However I found the possibility that the AI instead of our job. So we are now face to the future that AI take place of human workers. And we lose the jobs because of AI's higher ability. From this article I think we have to more consider this problem. Because 'job' is the most important part of our life. And human beings must improve the ability which AI doesn't have such as creativity or imagination."
10857,I strongly agree with your opinion. I think this sanction only caused to sense of distrust to USA government. Of course we are now face to the danger of nuclear weapons. However Armed sanctions are not effective. And I think nothing is more important than negotiation.
10858,"I think Japanese government and people are not positive attitude to refugee accepted. However the problem of refugees is very serious in the world especially EU countries. Of course Japan has a lot of difficulty to accept them such as the barrier of language, geographical factors and so on. But the many of refugees are at a critical moment of death. Therefore we have to act to change this situation as fast as we can."
10859,I agree with you opinion. Because I think Japanese government and people are not positive attitude to refugee accepted. But the refugees problem is very serious in all over the world. And Japan should make effort to accept the many of refugees who are at a critical moment of death as soon as possible.
10860,"I don't think so, because if AI become god in the future, it might be out of our control. I think AI brings dangerous things than we think. We should focus on the both sides when we use AI."
10861,I agree with you. This case brings good opportunity to consider the current environment for women in society. I hope this kind of issues will be focused from now.
10862,We need to know that the influence of SNS such as twitter on people is great. This article conveyed the fear of SNS to us. To be convenient is not only good but also has disadvantages.
10863,"I partly agree with you. The economic sanctions are no longer effective. They will be firm from now on too, however, negotiation is good than such sanctions or war."
10864,"I think so too. Using the Internet is convenient, but the risk is also high. We think that we have to think about it carefully and use the Internet and SNS. So the most important thing is to think about the feelings of others."
10865,I have the same opinion with you. Koike's action can bring bad relation between Korea and Japan. I think she should have took softer ways.
10866,"I agree with you, when we use useful technology, we should rethink the both merits and demerits.Like you say, high sophisticate technology has risks I think."
10867,"I disagree with this opinion. Scientifically, our actions have little impact on climate change and we believe that climate change is natural. Certainly human have to be careful, but I think that it is different to make only human faults."
10868,"It is sad that people lose their lives due to natural disasters such as hurricanes. I think it is necessary to prepare for natural disasters. However, I believe there are still natural disasters that can not be prevented. That can not be done with our power."
10869,I was recognized the influence of SNS again to read this article. I didn't know that twitter was used to racism. SNS has incredible influences for better or worse. I should choose the way to tell my feelings when I use SNS.
10870,I learned of this new function through CM. I was very surprised and it was an interesting feature. I think that this function is very effective in the present age where the strengthening of security is required. I think that such development should progress more and more.
10871,"I think it is very difficult to summarize the countries of many ethnic groups. However, I think that the leaders need attitude to protect minorities rather than excluding them."
10872,Mourning for the victims should be done. It has nothing to do with politics. She needs more attitude to respect other countries.
10873,"Although America and Japan have shown the attitude of dialogue so far, they have sanctioned it because North Korea did not accept it. I will support it. Some people are concerned that North Korea will take dangerous actions as more sanctions are done, but North Korea is repeating dangerous actions even if it is not actually sanctioning, waiting for further dialogue I think that it can not be helped."
10874,The day the time machine can may be close. I would like to expect these studies.
10875,I agree with your opinion. Citizens don't know well about politics. That leads to the low vote rates and makes citizens hard to make a decision. It is important for everyone to be sensitive to the news and commit into the society.
10876,"Economic restrictions on North Korea is no longer effective because the profit of the country is the first priority for them. No matter how many people suffer from hunger or poverty, North Korea don't stop making weapons. What is needed is to construct a friendly relationship with them."
10877,"AI is so influential. Also, as you said, it is likely to take control over human beings. It is so perfect and people may rely on it too much. We should consider the risk of introducing AI."
10878,I agree with your opinions. New technologies are often controversial because everything has good and bad aspects. No doubt that AI can make tasks easier and provide us with convenient lives. But also there is the danger of human beings rely too much on AI. We should contemplate about the effects of introducing AI make the use of it in a safe way.
10879,"Donald Trump always has discriminatory attitude toward the minority. I think American selected the wrong person. He has a talent for business, but he is not suitable for a president."
10880,"As you said, almost nothing can be done when natural disasters happen. However, according to this article, some of disasters are caused by global warming and we are responsible for it. What we can do is consider environmental problems and try not to waste resources. There are a lot of little things we can do for preventing global warming."
10881,I have same opinion. AI will become necessary for our life in the future. What we need is to coexist with AI.
10882,"I agree with your opinion. SNS can be used in effective way but we also have to be careful in using media because we don't know if people use SNS is trustable. Moreover, other people may get the idea different from what the message originally means. We should keep in mind the danger of using SNS."
10883,I think that Koike acted inappropriate. She should have predicted the reaction of South Korean. Not sending eulogy is crucial because it had been done for years and it has a significant meaning for the relationship of Korean and Japanese. She should have sent eulogy in order to avoid the friction between South Korea and Japan.
10884,"I agree with your idea. Japan situates very close to North Korea, also Japan is likely to be the pass point of the US if a war break out between the US and North Korea.Japan should consider the problem more seriously and think about how to defense itself other than just relying on the US."
10885,"I agree with you. I thought it is interesting to feel that we don't need any more technology to improve our life. when I thought about myself, I thought it is applied to me, too. In many scenes, we are said not to be satisfied and always try to improve more, but I think that it is not true in some cases. When we have enough, we can be satisfied."
10886,"I disagree with you. I don't think that the religion by AI God will spread all over Japan, because I don't think that AI God religion attract many people in Japan. AI religion plays the role of religion, but as you say, most Japanese people think they don't need any religion for themselves."
10887,"I agree with you. I think it happens in many other cases ,too. For example, in some religion like Islam doesn't admit the LGBT thought, and these days it is criticized. it happens because they believe deeply what is right and wrong. When we think that something is right, we also need to know that it can be dangerous."
10888,"I agree with MH. Regarding that the population of Japan will keep decreasing in the future and the economy also become smaller, I think that Japan will have less global influence in politics in the future compare to before. So I think its so dangerous to let the US leave from Japan. As MH said in the article, now Japan shares the border with aggressive countries like China and North Korea, and Japan will have less power. I think Japan need to learn how to behave cleverly as a small country."
10889,I agree with you. Abe sometimes decides something forcefully. I think he should deepen the public understanding more. I also want to think and look up more about constitutional problem.
10890,"I think the facial recognition unlock technology is very convenient and cool, but at the same time I feel scared a little. When new technology comes out, it's so fun and cool to use it soon, but I want to use it after some time because usually many problems comes out when it is released."
